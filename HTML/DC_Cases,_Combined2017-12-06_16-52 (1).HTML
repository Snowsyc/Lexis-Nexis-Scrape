</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner detainee, a Yemeni citizen, had been held at the U.S. naval base detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002. He had traveled through Pakistan to Afghanistan eager to defend the Taliban's Islamic state against the Northern Alliance. He was handed over to United States Coalition forces in early 2002. He appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainee was lawfully detained whether the definition of a detainable person was, as the district court articulated it, an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated forces that were engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, or the modified definition offered by the government that required that an individual substantially support enemy forces. Any person subject to a military commission trial was also subject to detention, and that category of persons included those who are part of forces associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban or those who purposefully and materially supported such forces in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. The facts showed the detainee was part of and supported a group--prior to and after September 11--that was affiliated with Al Qaeda and Taliban forces and engaged in hostilities against a U.S. Coalition partner. He, therefore, fells squarely within the scope of the President's statutory detention powers. In the absence of a determination by the political branches that hostilities in Afghanistan have ceased, the detainee's continued detention was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the detainee's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant antiwar group and religious foundation sued appellee District of Columbia, alleging that regulations governing the placement of posters violated the First Amendment and due process.

The foundation and group appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court erred in finding that the foundation lacked standing where its executive director's affidavit plainly indicated an intent to engage in conduct violating the 60-day limit for removing posters related to a specific event, the foundation was challenging a regulation that was claimed to burden expressive freedom, and the District had brought an enforcement action against the group for violations of the postering rules, thereby providing an expectation that the government would enforce the law. As for the group's claims, it could have raised constitutional challenges in the instant action that were completely independent of and severable from the violations that it was facing in the District's administrative proceedings. Since it was unclear whether the group had been charged with violating regulations other than the adhesive rule, the group had suggested in oral argument that it was not foreswearing severability, and the case was being already being remanded, it was appropriate to reverse and remand the judgment so that the parties could supplement the record to lay an accurate basis for resolving the Younger abstention issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the drug offense pursuant to a plea agreement that required him to cooperate with law enforcement authorities and required the government to seek a departure pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 5K1.1. The government sought the &sect; 5K1.1 departure but did not file a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3553(e) for a sentence below the mandatory statutory minimum. On appeal, the court held the district court did not have authority to sentence defendant below the statutory minimum absent a motion by the Government under &sect; 3553(e). The Government did not violate due process in failing to file such a motion because the plea agreement did not require it to do so, and its decision was rationally related to legitimate government ends. Specifically, its assessment that defendant's cooperation was sufficient to warrant a significant departure from the Guidelines sentence calculation but not a departure from the mandatory minimum sentence, in light of his drug selling history, was rational. The decision served the legitimate ends of seeking more cooperation and ensuring that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Virginia Special Conservator of the Peace (SCOP) authorized to carry weapons within Virginia, sued appellee District of Columbia (D.C.) alleging lack of probable cause for an arrest warrant for allegedly violating D.C. firearms laws. Because he was never arrested, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found no genuine and imminent risk of prosecution and dismissed for lack of standing. The SCOP appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warrant, the arrests of his company's employees, and allegations that police were determined to drive his company from D.C., all showed a special priority on enforcing the law against him. The SCOP's injury stemmed from his inability to travel to D.C. and carry on his business there while armed without fear of prosecution. That injury was imminent because the District of Columbia has made clear its specific intention to prosecute him. He had U.S. Const. art. III standing. The warrant prevented him from entering D.C. and he had to abandon contracts. The question bore directly on the existence of probable cause: whether the responsible officer, knowing that the SCOP was exempt from D.C. Code &sect; 7-2502.01(a) due to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 926B, nonetheless filed an affidavit in bad faith. Even if the allegations did not state a Fourth Amendment claim (a question for the district court), that was no basis to find the claim was so insubstantial as to deprive the district court of jurisdiction. The SCOP may not have been seized in the traditional sense, but the warrant effectively exiled him from D.C., thus restricting his ability to travel and causing him substantial injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was reversed and the claims were remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner sued defendant Bureau of Prisons (BOP) under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 552a, for damages and amendment of his prison records after he was found guilty of possessing drug paraphernalia and sanctions were imposed that included the loss of 40 days of good-time credits. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed, finding that inmate records were exempt under the Act. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 552a(j), the BOP, in 28 C.F.R. &sect; 16.97(a) (1976), exempted its inmate records from &sect; 552a(d)'s amendment provision. Thus, dismissal of the amendment claim was proper. While &sect; 16.97(a) did not exempt the records from &sect; 552a(e)(5)'s duty to accurately maintain records used in any determination, and &sect; 552a(g)'s damages provision provided a remedy for &sect; 552a(e)(5) violations, it was unnecessary to decide if a later regulation exempting the records from &sect; 552a(e)(5) applied, since the damages claim was barred for lack of a successful habeas challenge to the disciplinary hearing on which it was based. The prisoner was challenging the duration of his imprisonment, thus, his sole remedy was a writ of habeas corpus. While under &sect; 552a(g)(4) he alleged willfulness in relying upon inaccurate records to discipline him unfairly for allegedly possessing cocaine, a restoration of good time credits would accelerate release. Thus, he first had to proceed in habeas even though his second claim only sought damages since all of his punishments resulted from the same &quot;Incorrect Information&quot; in his file and from the same finding of guilt at the same hearing on the basis of that information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the claim for amendment of the prisoner's records was affirmed. The dismissal of the damages claim was affirmed on the alternative ground that such a claim was not cognizable unless the prisoner first secured relief through a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit entity appealed the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia's judgment rejecting its First Amendment challenge to regulations promulgated by defendant Federal Election Commission (FEC) restricting how non-profits were permitted to spend and raise money to advance their preferred policy positions and candidates. Plaintiff also challenged the regulations under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 431.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a hybrid nonprofit that made expenditures for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration and also directly contributed to candidates and parties. By passing 11 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 106.6(c), (f), 100.57, the FEC did not ban nonprofits from receiving and spending large political donations but dictated that they pay for most election-related activities out of their hard-money accounts. On appeal, the court decided whether the FEC could regulate nonprofit entities that were unconnected to a candidate, party, or for-profit corporation--in other words, whether independent nonprofits were to be treated like individual citizens (who, under Buckley, had the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates) or like political parties (which, under McConnell, did not have the right to raise and spend unlimited soft money). The court refused to apply the McConnell standard to nonprofits and held that the First Amendment permitted them, like individuals but unlike political parties, to spend unlimited amounts out of their soft-money accounts for election-related activities. Three of the regulations also exceeded the FEC's authority under FECA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court that the FEC regulations contravened the First Amendment and FECA. The court reversed the judgment of the district court and directed it to enter judgment for the nonprofit corporation and to vacate the challenged FEC regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an industrial trade association, sought judicial review of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's denial of its motion for a judgment on the pleadings in its challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 207 of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA). The suit contended that 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1603(b)(3), as amended by HLOGA &sect; 207, violated the First Amendment and was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1603(b)(3), as amended, satisfied the requirements of strict scrutiny. The statutory language was quite clear. The purpose of the lobbying disclosure statute was to provide greater public information about who was lobbying Congress and what they were lobbying about. The government had a compelling interest in providing the public and its elected representatives with information regarding who was being hired, who was putting up the money, and how much they were spending to influence public officials. Amended &sect; 1603(b)(3) effectively advanced the interest the government proffered in support of it, and it was not fatally underinclusive. Finally, it was narrowly tailored. The association's facial and as-applied First Amendment challenges failed. The risks that the association claimed its members would suffer if their participation in controversial lobbying were revealed were no different from those suffered by any organization that employed or hired lobbyists itself. Amended &sect; 1603(b)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague. Neither the term actively participates nor the term lobbying activities rendered amended &sect; 1603(b)(3)(B) impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner cable company and several intervenors involved in the cable television industry petitioned for review of a rule in which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), exercising its authority pursuant to 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 533(f)(1), capped at 30% of all subscribers the market share any single cable television operator could serve. Other entities in the broadcast industry intervened in support of the FCC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court found that petitioner cable operator had standing based on its statement that it could have seriously pursued a specific but unidentified transaction if the rule had not been in place. Because intervenors supporting the FCC raised the same issues and arguments as the FCC, their standing was of no consequence. As for promulgation of the new rule, in view of the overwhelming evidence concerning the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace and the entry of new competitors at both the programming and the distribution levels, it was arbitrary and capricious for the FCC to conclude that a cable operator serving more than 30% of the market posed a threat either to competition or diversity in programming. The FCC failed to identify a sufficient basis for imposing upon cable operators the special obligations, represented by the 30% subscriber limit. The FCC failed adequately to take account of the substantial competition cable operators faced from non-cable video programming distributors. The FCC failed to heed the court's direction and the same objections to the rationale for the cap were again before the court; thus, vacatur was indicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for review and vacated the subscriber limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an interlocutory appeal, appellant Native Americans and cross-appellant, the Secretary of the Interior and federal officials, sought judicial review of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's order's holding the Department of the Interior to be in continuing breach of its duty to account for Native American trust funds, that accounting for the funds was impossible, and awarding monetary relief to the Native Americans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since passage of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), Pub. L. No. 103-412, 108 Stat. 4239 (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 162a et seq., and 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 4001-4061) and the filing of the present lawsuit, the Department of the Interior (Interior) had mixed success in its efforts to account for Native American trust funds. The district court was incorrect insofar as it assumed that the scope of the accounting obligation could not be adjusted in equity. The Native Americans were entitled to an accounting under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4011(a). The district court's holding of impossibility contradicted the requirement of an equitable accounting--one that made the most efficient use of limited government resources. The overarching aim of the district court should be for Interior to provide the trust beneficiaries the best accounting possible, in a reasonable time, with the money that Congress is willing to appropriate. Interior could use statistical sampling when verifying transactions under $ 500. The court was given guidance on how to handle land escheatments and administrative fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the district court were vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists were District of Columbia citizens who were denied entry at a neighborhood checkpoint on account of their refusal to provide certain information to the police. They asserted that the checkpoints constituted unconstitutional seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court held that the motorists did not establish irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits and thus denied their motion for a preliminary injunction. The appellate court disagreed. The reason for stopping each motorist was the possibility, without individualized suspicion, that he or she might have been the potential perpetrator of an undetected, perhaps uncommitted, crime. Since the primary purpose of the checkpoint program was a general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the motorists' likelihood of success on the merits was strong. They also sufficiently demonstrated irreparable injury, particularly in light of their strong likelihood of success on the merits: the motorists had a right to drive upon the public streets of the District of Columbia or any other city absent a constitutionally sound reason for limiting their access.</SPAN></P>

L. No. 107-228, 116 Stat. 1350 (2002) (codified at 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2651 note) to record &quot;Jerusalem, Israel,&quot; or &quot;Israel&quot; as his birthplace.</SPAN></P>

Under U.S. Const. art. II, &sect; 3, the President had exclusive and unreviewable constitutional power to keep the United States out of the debate over the status of Jerusalem. Policy decisions made pursuant to that recognition power were nonjusticiable political questions. Every president since 1948 had, as a matter of official policy, purposefully avoided taking a position on the issue whether Israel's sovereignty extended to the city of Jerusalem. The State Department's refusal to record &quot;Israel&quot; in passports and Reports of Birth of U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem implemented that long-standing policy of the Executive. The court would not question the President's exercise of the recognition power. Resolving the claim either at the jurisdictional stage under the political question doctrine or on the merits by striking the Act implicated the recognition power. Only the Executive could define policy on Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g)(1). The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that appellant possessed the gun in connection with his possession with intent to distribute marijuana, applied a four-level enhancement to his sentence under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 2K2.1(b)(6) (2007), and sentenced him to 57 months in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the district court erred by increasing his offense level under &sect; 2K2.1(b)(6). He objected to the district court's findings that he possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(d), and that he possessed his weapon in connection with the drug offense. With respect to the claim that appellant lacked the specific intent to distribute the marijuana due to PCP intoxication, there was no clear error in the district court's determination that appellant had the requisite intent. Despite his intoxication, appellant was able to operate a motor vehicle, deliberately drive to the police station, retrieve his gun from the trunk, fire the weapon into the air several times, and then remove the magazine and throw down both the gun and magazine when ordered to do so. With respect to the claim that appellant did not use or possess his weapon in connection with the marijuana offense, there was no dispute that his handgun was found in close proximity to drugs, and the only way to reverse the district court's &quot;in connection with&quot; finding under &sect; 2K2.1(b)(6) required disregarding &sect; 2K2.1(b)(6), cmt., application n. 14.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order of the Copyright Royalty Judges (CRJ), an agency comprised of members appointed by appellee Librarian of Congress, set the royalty rate that intervenor satellite radio service companies had to pay under 17 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 114(f)(1)(A), 801(b)(1), to copyright owners under a sound recordings license. Appellant, a royalty distributor, sought review, arguing it was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CRJ chose an initial rate equal to 6.0 % of revenue, increasing to 8.0 % over the term of the license, but did not to set a separate rate for ephemeral copies, deeming the 17 U.S.C.S. &sect; 112 rate for an ephemeral copy &quot;embodied&quot; in the rate set for the &sect; 114 license. Even if the CRJ had held that 13 %, the rate sought by the distributor, was reasonable for transmitting musical works, the CRJ was under no obligation to choose a rate derived from a market-based approach. The claim that &sect; 801 clearly required using market rates was wrong. The distributor pointed to no credible evidence in the record that any of the types of revenue the order excluded from gross revenues currently constituted or were projected to account for an amount of gross revenues that would significantly impact the calculation. But, the Librarian conceded it was error not to have set a separate rate for the &sect; 112 license to make ephemeral copies (digital copies of a sound recording stored on a computer), and the lack of evidence identified by the CRJ counseled against the court setting any rate. Thus, remand for the CRJ to set an appropriate rate for ephemeral copies was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for review was denied with respect to the royalty rate for the use of sound recordings but was granted with respect to the CRJ's failure to set a royalty rate for &quot;ephemeral copies&quot; of sound recordings and the case was remanded for the CRJ to set the royalty rate for ephemeral copies in the first instance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant congressman appealed an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia denying the congressman's motion to quash grand jury subpoenas served upon the law firm and upon individual lawyers who represented the congressman before the Ethics Committee of the House of Representatives. The congressman contended that testimony and documents called for were protected by the Speech or Debate Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inquiry of Ethics Committee concerned whether a trip of the congressman was an exercise of his official powers or an abuse of those powers, i.e., a privately sponsored vacation. The government served the subpoenas after the congressman declined to be interviewed as to certain statements made in his responses to the Committee. The district court concluded that his responses to the Committee were made in his personal capacity as a witness and not in his legislative capacity. On review, the court reversed the denial of the motion to quash because the matters at issues were protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The congressman's statements were protected because they were directly spurred by the inquiry into whether he had abused his office to obtain a vacation. Therefore, the congressman could not be questioned &quot;in any other place&quot; concerning the matters at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's order denying the motion to quash and directed the district court to enter an order consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a District of Columbia resident, filed a pro se complaint against appellees, the District of Columbia, District officials, and federal officials, alleging due process and equal protection violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985(3), 1986, and Bivens. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted appellees' motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident contended that he was unlawfully removed from grand jury service because of his deliberative judgments and his Hispanic ethnicity. In dismissing the case, the district court concluded that two officials, the District's juror officer and the federal supervising Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) were entitled to absolute immunity from liability on the due process claims raised by the resident. This was error. When the juror officer dismissed the resident from the grand jury, she was performing administrative/managerial functions. The District failed demonstrate that the acts the juror officer performed were quasi-judicial functions that were functionally comparable to those of a judge. Therefore, she was not entitled to absolute immunity. The supervising AUSA's alleged activities--improperly removing a grand juror on the basis of his ethnicity and/or for the content and quality of his deliberations--had nothing to do with a prosecutor's preparation for or participation in a criminal trial. Thus, the supervising AUSA was not entitled to absolute immunity because the activities for which he was being sued did not relate to his performance as an advocate for the Government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the due process claims against the juror officer and the supervising AUSA were reversed, and the case was remanded to allow the district court to assess whether those officials were protected by qualified immunity. The dismissal of the remaining claims was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cigarette manufacturers and tobacco trade organizations appealed a judgment from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia finding them liable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1962(c), (d), for jointly engaging in a pattern of mail and wire fraud. Plaintiff government and intervenor public interest groups cross-appealed from the denial of additional injunctive remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nine cigarette manufacturers and two trade organizations were found liable for joining in a 50-year conspiracy to deceive the American public about the health effects and addictiveness of cigarettes in violation of RICO. On appeal, the court held that the definitions of &quot;persons&quot; and &quot;enterprise&quot; in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961(3), (4), embraced a mixed group of individuals and corporations associated in fact. A &quot;scheme to defraud&quot; consisting of 108 acts of mail fraud and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1341, 1343, based on &quot;a pattern of racketeering activity&quot; on the part of each defendant under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1962(c), with the specific intent to defraud and material falsity, was proved. The manufacturers were properly enjoined from making further misleading advertising statement, but injunctive relief against the trade organizations, which had been dissolved under a previous master settlement agreement, was dismissed as moot. The injunctions were overly broad in several respects. The district court properly rejected the government's proposed remedies of disgorgement; counter-marketing, smoking cessation, and youth smoking reduction plans; and a quasi-judicial monitoring scheme.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, finding the manufacturers liable for RICO infractions but remanding for dismissal of the trade organizations.

The Board argued that because the Board itself had earlier delegated all of its authority to a three-member panel of which the two remaining Board members constituted a quorum, that quorum of the delegee panel had the authority to enter the order. The court concluded that the Board's purported order was beyond its lawful authority, so the purported order was without force. Congress provided unequivocally that a quorum of the Board was three members, and that this requirement had to be met at all times, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 153(b). The delegee group quorum provision did not eliminate this requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court vacated the present court's decision and remanded the case for further consideration in light of the Boumediene decision. In the present case, appellants, four British nationals, who were former detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba sued defendants, 11 federal officials. The complaint contained seven counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counts 1-3 invoked federal jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute,&nbsp;28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1350, and alleged violations of international law. Count 4 alleged violations of unspecified provisions of the Geneva Convention. Counts 5 and 6 asserted Bivens claims for violations of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution, and count 7 alleged a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2000bb et seq. The detainees did not attempt to show how the Boumediene decision bore on counts 1 to 4. In regards to the remaining three counts, the present court declined to decide if the Boumediene decision portended application of the Due Process Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause to Guantanamo Bay detainees. The officials were entitled to qualified immunity as to counts 5 and 6. The Insular Cases could not have clearly established that constitutional rights extend to aliens held at Guantanamo Bay. As to count 7, the Boumediene could not possibly have altered--retroactively--the meaning of RFRA. The court had previously held that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the detainees were not protected persons within the meaning of the RFRA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated habeas corpus actions, respondent government appealed nine interim orders from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia requiring the government to provide 30 days' notice to the district court and to counsel before transferring petitioners, nine detainees, from incarceration at a U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the government decided that they were no longer considered to be enemy combatants, the detainees sought to prevent their transfer to any country where they were likely to be subjected to further detention or to torture. On appeal, the court rejected the government's argument that &sect; 7 of the Military Commissions Act (MCA), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e)(1), barred the district court from exercising jurisdiction in the detainees' ongoing habeas cases over ancillary claims such as those related to the detainees' potential transfers. The U.S. Supreme Court's Boumediene rule protected all habeas corpus rights, not just so-called &quot;core&quot; habeas rights. Furthermore, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e)(2) of the MCA did not bar the court from taking jurisdiction, as it did not apply to habeas claims. The Munaf rule precluded the court from issuing a habeas writ to prevent transfers on the grounds asserted by the detainees, i.e., torture, further detention, or prosecution by a recipient country. The district court lacked authority to bar the government from releasing a detainee into the custody of another sovereign merely because that sovereign might prosecute or detain the detainee under its own laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff farm and dairy owners appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's dismissal of their claim against defendant United States, challenging the constitutionality of the Milk Regulatory Equity Act of 2005's amendments, in 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 608c, to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act (AMAA), 7 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 601-674. The owners argued exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 608c(15)(A)'s mandatory administrative exhaustion requirement did not apply to constitutional challenges to the AMAA itself, as distinct from challenges to regulatory orders and attendant obligations. The owners were not challenging a marketing order for which exhaustion was required; the complaint alleged the MREA, as adopted, contained provisions that singled out and punished the owners, specifically, &sect; 608c(5)(M), (N). The government's suggestion that the amendments did not subject formerly exempt producer-handlers to such obligations ignored the inexorable consequences of the amendments. It was not shown that to become effective, the MREA required a marketing order. The question of whether exhaustion was jurisdictional or mandatory did not have to be reached because it was clear the AMAA did not create a jurisdictional exhaustion requirement for challenges to the AMAA itself. Because the owners' objections did not involve an alleged defect in a marketing order and the Secretary of Agriculture lacked the power to provide a remedy, requiring exhaustion as a prudential matter would not protect agency authority or advance judicial efficiency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated habeas case, appellant United States (government) sought judicial review of a 2005 order by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia compelling disclosure of certain classified information to counsel for appellees, certain detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The government appealed from the order granting defense counsel access to the redacted information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the government and the detainees urged the court to rely, by analogy, on the procedures applicable to criminal proceedings and to appellate review under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2680 (2005). They disagreed as to how the court should apply those procedures. The district court's order simply stated that the classified information was relevant. Although the district court may well have considered materiality as an implicit part of the relevance analysis, the order did not indicate whether that was the case. Absent such an indication and an explanation of the district court's reasoning, the appellate court could not conclude that the redacted information was in fact material. The appellate court was unable to determine whether the district court found that the redacted classified information was material to the detainees' cases and necessary to facilitate meaningful habeas review. Nor could the appellate court determine whether the district court found that alternatives to disclosure were insufficient. The district court had to state its individualized determinations on the record in order to enable informed appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's order compelling disclosure of certain classified information to counsel for certain detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba was vacated, and the cases were remanded so that the district court could consider the findings required before a discovery order could issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, petitioners, various state agencies, environmental groups, and industry groups, joined by several intervenors and amici, sought review of an order of respondent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The associations challenged the EPA's 2006 revisions to its national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for fine and coarse particulate matter (PM) promulgated under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7401-7671p.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of the EPA's 2006 national clean air standard revisions, the court held that the EPA failed to adequately to explain why--in view of the risks of short-term exposure to fine PM and the morbidity resulting from long-term exposure to fine PM--the annual standard adequately protected public health under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7409(b)(1). The EPA failed to explain (1) its reason for not accepting the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee's recommendations that short-term air quality studies were relevant in setting new national standards; (2) why its daily standard shielded the public from risks associated with short-term exposure; and (3) how sub-populations of children and vulnerable adults were protected. Otherwise, the EPA reasonably analyzed the risks associated with fine PM. However, the EPA's decision to set secondary fine PM NAAQS identical to primary NAAQS was contrary to the requirements of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7409(b)(2). With regard to coarse PM, the EPA reasonably retained a daily standard for urban and nonurban areas. The daily NAAQS and indicators for coarse PM adequately protected public health. The EPA reasonably decided that an annual coarse PM standard was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petitions for review in part and denied them in part. The court remanded the national standards for fine PM to the EPA for further proceedings.

By conceding the constitutionality of &sect; 222, petitioners necessarily conceded at least two factual predicates underlying both the statute and the FCC's Order--namely, that the government had a substantial interest in protecting the privacy of customer information and that requiring customer approval advanced that interest. Also, the privacy of customer information could not be preserved unless there were restrictions on the carrier's disclosure of it. The FCC reasonably concluded that an opt-in consent requirement directly and materially advanced the interests in protecting customer privacy and in ensuring customer control over the information. The evidence supported the FCC's decision to prefer opt-in consent. The evidence showed that customers were less willing to have their information shared with third parties as opposed to affiliated entities. The FCC reasonably concluded that customer information would be at a greater risk of disclosure once out of the control of the carriers and in the hands of entities not subject to &sect; 222.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, following his entry to a guilty plea to the possession of false document-making implements in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1028(a)(5) on three specific dates. He asserted that the district court improperly calculated his sentencing range by misapplying U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 2B1.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant produced false identifications and counterfeit documents that were used by others to bilk several banks out of more than $ 110,000. The plea agreement stipulated that U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 2B1.1 applied to the offense. Defendant conceded two two-level increases to his sentence because his offense involved more than ten but fewer than fifty victims, and because the offense involved the possession of device-making equipment. He opposed the government's assertion that his relevant conduct included the bank fraud conducted by others. If the bank fraud was conduct relevant for his admitted offense, the loss he caused would rise to between $ 200,000 and $ 400,000, and his offense level was increased by twelve levels. He also challenged a finding that his offense involved the use of sophisticated means, another two-level enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 2B1.1(b)(8)(C). On appeal, the court affirmed as to the latter enhancement, but not the former. The bank fraud was not temporally tied by the prosecution to the defendant's admitted possession of the criminal tools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing, because the district court erred by including as relevant conduct a bank fraud the government failed to show had the requisite connection to defendant's admitted criminal acts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner airlines filed a petition for review of a final order of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), arguing that TSA erroneously overcharged them for their statutory portion of security costs. The airlines challenged TSA's final decisions, claiming that they reflected substantive statutory violations, were arbitrary and capricious, and were flawed procedurally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found merit in the attack on TSA's understanding of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act's (ATSA), Pub. L. No. 107-71, 115 Stat. 625 (2001), &quot;overall&quot; limit, but not in the other objections. As to the &quot;overall limit,&quot; the airlines argued that TSA violated the plain language of 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 44940(a)(2)(B)(i) by basing its calculation of the fees on a Government Accountability Office estimate which had included the costs of screening non-passengers, such as &quot;meeters-and-greeters&quot; and sightseers. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;screening passengers&quot; had a widely understood meaning: it referred to the process of searching airline passengers at an airport security checkpoint, not to the entire set of activities undertaken to promote passenger safety. As to &quot;per-carrier limit,&quot; however, although the airlines might have preferred that TSA rely on their Appendix A information, TSA was entitled to conclude that, in the absence of an audit, such data were not reliable enough. TSA was also free to select a reasonable alternative, such as the industry's average cost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">TSA erred in its interpretation of the ATSA's overall limit and in its classification of the audit opinion, so the court remanded for certain modifications. The court otherwise affirmed TSA's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court reinstated its decision establishing DTA review procedures. On a petition for rehearing, respondent, the Secretary of Defense, contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rehearing was granted to determine whether the court retained jurisdiction after the U.S. Supreme Court had found unconstitutional &sect; 7 of the Military Commission Act of 2006 (formerly DTA &sect; 1005(e)(1)), codified at 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e), which abolished habeas jurisdiction for Guantanamo detainees. The Secretary contended that because that provision was unconstitutional, DTA &sect; 1005(e)(2) also had to fall. The court dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction because the availability of judicial review pursuant to DTA &sect; 1005(e)(2) as a supplement to habeas relief was not consistent with the basic objective of Congress when it enacted the DTA judicial review provision. Congress had understood that review under &sect; 1005(e)(2) was to be a substitute for and not a supplement to habeas corpus. The court was confident that Congress would not have enacted &sect; 1005(e)(2) in the absence of the provision banning courts from exercising jurisdiction over a detainee's habeas petition. Therefore, because the latter provision was held unconstitutional and the two provisions were not severable, the judicial review provision of &sect; 1005(e)(2) also failed.</SPAN></P>

The inmate's Free Exercise Clause claim failed. He was not relieved of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribed or prescribed conduct that his religion prescribed or proscribed. His RFRA claim failed. He did not allege any religious observance that the DNA Act impeded, or acts in violation of his religious beliefs that it pressured him to perform. His status as a first-time offender of a non-violent crime did not lessen the government's interest in collecting his DNA. The DNA Act did not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the right against self-incrimination, or the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Commercial airline pilots who reached 60 before December 13, 2007, petitioned for review of the FAA's denial of an exemption from the Age 60 Rule. On December 13, 2007, the President signed into law the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act (FTEPA), 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 44729. The court dismissed the petitions for review. The court held that the FTEPA, which expressly abrogated the Age 60 Rule, mooted the petitions for review of the orders denying exemption from the Age 60 Rule. The court held that, if the pilots wished to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on its face, they were, assuming they could show Article III standing, to file a complaint in the district court because seeking initial review of the statute before the court extended beyond the jurisdictional grant of 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 46110(a). The court did not have jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions unrelated to the FAA's order, including their claim that FTEPA's treatment of pilots who reached age 60 before its enactment was unconstitutional. The facial challenge to the Act was to be brought in the district court, which had original jurisdiction over federal question claims under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1331.</SPAN></P>

The petition for direct review in the appellate court raised common issues regarding the legality of the detainee's detention. Resolution of the habeas action in his favor could entirely, or partially, moot his direct review petition. Habeas was the preferred course for the Guantanamo Bay detainees. In light of the United States Supreme Court case of Boumediene, the appellate court had lost jurisdiction over the direct review petition and every all other such petitions filed under the Detainee Treatment Act. There was a high probability that a consequence of Boumediene's striking down the legislative bar against habeas jurisdiction was that the direct judicial review provision of the Detainee Treatment Act fell as well. Congress had rejected proposed amendments to the Military Commissions Act that would have afforded detainees access to dual remedies. Since Boumediene had restored habeas jurisdiction, the original reasons for direct review had vanished. Since the direct review provision could no longer function in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress, it too fell. Abeyance was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Travel to Cuba was generally restricted under the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 5(b), as implemented by the Secretary's Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. pt. 515, with furthered the objective of isolating the Cuban government by depriving the island's economy of the benefit of U.S. dollars. The academics objected to 2004 amendments that tightened the licensure requirements for student travel-abroad programs by restricting licenses to full semester courses taught by university professors in order to prevent the programs from degenerating into purely tourist activities. Applying an intermediate level of scrutiny, the appeals court agreed that the regulations did not unconstitutionally restrict academic freedom rights under the First Amendment because they were content-neutral and furthered an important government interest. The academics' Fifth Amendment challenge was unfounded because the government could restrict international travel for foreign policy reasons. The academics' APA claim failed because the factual premises underlying a commission report that prompted the regulatory revisions were intertwined with unreviewable foreign policy judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a public interest group and one of its registered accounting firm members, appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's grant of summary judgment to appellees, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and intervenor United States, on claims that Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7211-19, violated the Appointments Clause and separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act did not encroach upon the Appointments Clause power because, in view of the Securities and Exchange Commission's comprehensive control of the Board, the Board's members were inferior officers not required to be appointed by the United States President. The Board's work was necessarily directed and supervised by the Commission. The for-cause limitations under 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3) on the Commission's power to remove Board members and the President's power to remove Commissioners did not strip the President of sufficient power to influence the Board and thus did not contravene separation of powers, as that principle embraced independent agencies like the Commission and their exercise of broad authority over their subordinates. Not only was the Board subject to statutorily-defined jurisdictional boundaries, but also the Commission was empowered to further limit the Board's functions as stated in &sect; 7217(d)(2). Given the constitutionality of independent agencies and the Commission's comprehensive control over the Board, it could not be shown that the statutory scheme so restricted the President's control over the Board as to violate separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the district court erred in holding that special factors precluded implication of a Bivens claim and that the government's Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2679, certification was proper. As to the Bivens argument, each claim in the complaint was based on this disclosure of Privacy Act protected information. The instant court could not create a Bivens remedy because the comprehensive Privacy Act and the sensitive intelligence information concerns affiliated with this case precluded it from doing so. The intentional omission of the Presidential and Vice Presidential offices from the comprehensive coverage of the Privacy Act required the court to deny the additional remedies to appellants which they sought. Because Congress created a comprehensive Privacy Act scheme that did not inadvertently exclude a remedy for the claims brought against these defendants, the court would not supplement the scheme with Bivens remedies. As to the Westfall Act, appellants also failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as required to pursue a tort claim against the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, shareholders on behalf of the Federal National Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), appealed a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissing the shareholders' derivative action brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1 against defendants, Fannie Mae directors, alleging that the directors failed to prevent accounting irregularities and challenging their approval of severance plans for two officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that the complaint failed to meet the test for demand futility under Rule 23.1. The court found that there was federal subject matter jurisdiction over the derivative complaint on behalf of Fannie Mae pursuant to 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1723a(a) because the statute's sue and be sued provision expressly referred to federal courts, despite the presence of an &quot;of competent jurisdiction&quot; phrase. On the merits, the court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The complaint failed to establish a likelihood of personal liability for the outside directors on the accounting related claims because under Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 141(e), the allegations did not create a reasonable doubt of the disinterestedness of the directors to consider a demand. The shareholders also failed to create a reasonable doubt as to whether the directors exercised a valid business judgment in order to rebut the presumption under the business judgment doctrine of &sect; 141(e). Finally, the shareholders failed to create a reasonable doubt about the directors' independence. Therefore, the shareholders failed to meet their burden to show demand futility under Rule 23.1 and Delaware law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, non-liturgical Protestant Naval chaplains both current and retired, appealed a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia holding that they lacked standing to sue defendant, the U.S. Navy, claiming that the Navy's retirement system discriminated in favor of Catholic chaplains in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-liturgical Protestant chaplains did not allege that the Navy actually discriminated against any of them but argued that the Navy's operation of its retirement system discriminated in favor of Catholic chaplains in violation of the Establishment Clause. The district court found that the non-liturgical Protestant chaplains lacked standing to sue under U.S. Const. art. III. On appeal, the court agreed. Assuming arguendo that the Navy's system violated the Establishment Clause, the Protestant chaplains had not suffered an injury-in-fact because, as they conceded, they themselves did not suffer employment discrimination on account of their religion; rather, they suggested that other chaplaincy groups recognized by the Navy, such as liturgical Protestant and Special Worship chaplains, suffered discrimination. The non-liturgical Protestant chaplains lacked standing as taxpayers because their Establishment Clause claim did not arise out of the Taxing and Spending Clause in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. They lacked standing based on their exposure to the Navy's message of religious preference because mere personal offense to government action did not give rise to standing to sue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the descendents of freed slaves (Freedmen), sued defendant Secretary of the Interior, alleging under 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 706(2)(A) that he arbitrarily recognized an election held by intervenor Cherokee Nation that disenfranchised the Freedmen. The Freedmen sought to enjoin such recognition. The Cherokee Nation appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's denial of its motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Freedmen argued that the Secretary's ratification of the Cherokee Nation's 2003 election disenfranchised them in violation of federal constitutional and statutory law. After determining that the tribe was a necessary party under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a), the district court concluded that the tribe and its officers could be joined because the tribe did not enjoy sovereign immunity against the Freedmen's suit. The issue raised by the Cherokee Nation on appeal was the extent to which sovereign immunity protected a federally-recognized tribe and its officers against suit. The court held that the district court erred in joining the tribe as a necessary party to the suit because nothing in U.S. Const. amend. XIII or a 1866 Treaty amounted to an express and unequivocal congressional abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity; therefore, the Cherokee Nation could not be joined in the Freedmen's federal court suit without the tribe's consent. However, tribal officers did not enjoy the same immunity from suit as did the tribe itself. Under Ex Parte Young, tribal officers could be enjoined from acting unconstitutionally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the Cherokee Nation was not amenable to suit based on its sovereign immunity and could not be joined as a required party under Fed. R. of Civ. P. 19(a). The court affirmed the district court's decision with regard to joining tribal officers as required parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit arose out of the advertiser having submitted seven self-styled whistleblower solicitation advertisements to two dozen CENs. He claimed that &sect; 4.11 of Department of Defense Instruction 5120.4 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to his paid advertisements, by violating his rights to free expression and to freedom of the press under the First Amendment. Section 4.11 was not unconstitutionally vague. The bar in &sect; 4.11 was well-defined. The advertiser argued unsuccessfully that &sect; 4.11 was not applied in a consistent manner. He also argued unsuccessfully that &sect; 4.11, as written and applied to his advertisements, was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Since the advertising section of a CEN was a nonpublic forum, the restriction upon speech in &sect; 4.11 needed only be reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum and viewpoint-neutral. It was clearly both. His claim of facial viewpoint discrimination was patently unfounded. Section 4.11 by its terms did not distinguish between political viewpoints.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While executing a search warrant at a house owned by the inmate's uncle, police seized large quantities of drugs and cash, finding loaded semiautomatic weapons inside the inmate's bedroom. The appeals court addressed only one of the issues raised in the district court, the inmate's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to insist that the judge instruct the jury that possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon was an element of a separate offense under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 924(c)(1) that the jury was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that the inmate did not object to jury instructions that defined &quot;firearm&quot; but did not mention assault weapons. After conviction, the judge, without objection, determined that the firearm that the inmate possessed was a Colt AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. The appeals court held that the type of firearm possessed by the inmate was not an element of the crime but a sentencing factor, which the district court properly found without a jury under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective, under either the first or the second prong of the Strickland test, for failing to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Republic of Sudan and its Interior Ministry, filed interlocutory appeals from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's order denying their motion to dismiss a third amended complaint filed by plaintiffs, U.S. nationals injured in terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa and their family members, under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1605(a)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The U.S. nationals and their families alleged that the Republic materially supported the terrorist groups that carried out three U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and asserted that the court had jurisdiction over the Republic and its Interior Ministry under FSIA's state sponsor of terrorism exception, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1605(a)(7). On appeal, the court held that Congress had been granted the power to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. Thus, Congress' delegation to the Executive Branch of factfinding to declare whether a foreign state was to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism for FSIA purposes did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The court also held that the third amended complaint alleged sufficient facts to meet the jurisdictional causation requirement of &sect; 1605(a)(7). The allegations demonstrated a reasonable connection between the Republic's sheltering and financial support of two prominent international terrorist groups and the terrorist bombings of the African embassies, which was sufficient specificity to meet the pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1) and the jurisdictional requirements of FSIA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citing to the Trade Secrets Act (TSA), Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the Administrative Procedures Act, appellant employer sought to enjoin appellee federal agency from disclosing confidential information without notice. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the case as unripe. The instant court reversed. On remand, the district court granted the agency's summary judgment motion. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency, charged with investigating employment law violations, issued a subpoena for documents the employer deemed and identified as confidential. The employer claimed that the agency's policy, which permitted its employees to disclose confidential information to potential employment discrimination plaintiffs without first notifying the employer that its information would be disclosed, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the Trade Secrets Act (TSA). Inter alia, the appellate court held that it was clear the agency had a policy of disclosing confidential information without notice. Although the purpose of the TSA might well be furthered if the agency gave submitters notice before disclosing their confidential information, the agency was not required to take explicit account of public policies that derive from federal statutes other than the agency's enabling act. However, maintaining two irreconcilable policies, one of which apparently enabled the agency or any person asking for information, to circumvent the agency's FOIA regulations, which required pre-release notification, was arbitrary and capricious agency action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed, and remanded the case for the district court to enter an injunction prohibiting the agency from disclosing the employer's confidential information pursuant to its current disclosure policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, police officer one, sought review of a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which granted summary judgment to appellees, police officer two and the District of Columbia, in officer one's suit asserting claims of police brutality, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the District and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 individual capacity claims against officer two.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officer one, who was off duty, attempted to help a stranger who said that he was being robbed. Unbeknownst to officer one, the stranger was a drug dealer who was being chased by police. When officer one realized what was happening, he placed himself in a prone position on the floor, with his arms and legs spread to indicate surrender. Officer two allegedly repeatedly kicked and stomped on officer one's groin and buttocks until officer two saw a police badge on officer one's neck. On appeal, the court first held that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to officer two on the basis of qualified immunity because, under the facts as presented by officer one, officer two violated officer one's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights through the use of excessive force, and a reasonable officer would have known that kicking officer one in the groin and stomping on him after he surrendered were not lawful means of effecting a seizure. However, the common law claims against the District were properly dismissed because officer one's exclusive remedy against the District was to obtain compensation under the Police and Firefighters Retirement and Disability Act, D.C. Code &sect; 5-701 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's judgment in favor of officer two and remanded for trial of officer one's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against officer two.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the unzipping of his jacket was unlawful, because it was not undertaken for protective purposes, but rather amounted to an impermissible evidentiary search unsupported by probable cause or a warrant. The instant court concluded that the police officers violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights by unzipping his jacket without his permission and without probable cause or a warrant. The frisk of defendant did not produce any evidence of a weapon. Nevertheless, the police undertook a further search aimed at determining whether certain physical evidence would identify defendant as the perpetrator of the crime in question. The police manipulated defendant's jacket, partially unzipping and opening it, so that a complainant could see the sweatshirt underneath defendant's jacket. Among other things, the government's argument, that the unzipping could be justified as an objectively reasonable response to defendant's alleged resistance during the pat down, was without support in the district court's factual findings. The district court declined to find either that the pat down was incomplete or that defendant in any way resisted the pat down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant coordinated a mortgage flipping scheme by using his shell company to purchase dilapidated real estate properties, obtaining inflated appraisals, then reselling the properties to himself for a much inflated value, often on the same day. He obtained mortgages based on the inflated appraisals, using the money to pay off the purchase prices and keeping the remaining funds for himself. After trial, the prosecutor informed defense counsel of the existence of undisclosed Brady evidence, i.e., new information that a key State's witness, a co-conspirator, had been accused of a similar fraud scheme, a fact that defendant could have used to impeach her. On appeal, the court held that the failure to disclose Brady materials was not cause for reversal because the evidence was cumulative of other impeachment evidence used at trial. Defendant's sentence was properly enhanced under &sect; 3B1.1(a) because he led and organized a conspiracy of five or more participants. Counsel's failure to request a downward departure based on defendant's status as a deportable alien was not evidence of ineffectiveness because the court indicated that it would not have granted a downward departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court lacked jurisdiction to evaluate the merits of the district court's substantive holdings because the entire case was moot. The case was moot because in their complaint plaintiffs challenged only the legality of the Navy's alleged Thirds Policy, but they admitted that the Thirds Policy ended in 2001 and that the Navy now maintained no religious quotas. Because plaintiffs never alleged that the Navy was likely to or even considering reinstituting the Thirds Policy, there was no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation would recur. The Navy's continued use of the Chaplain Accession and Recall Eligibility Board was irrelevant because the Board no longer applied any type of religious quota system. Because the Navy already eliminated the Thirds Policy and plaintiffs never alleged that the Navy would reinstitute it, any injunction or order declaring it illegal would have accomplished nothing--amounting to exactly the type of advisory opinion Article III of the United States Constitution prohibited. Because plaintiffs' claim relied on their first being hired as Navy chaplains--a vital condition that had yet to occur--it was unripe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant antigambling group that asserted that the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4321 et seq., was violated and that 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 465 was unconstitutional, appealed entry of summary judgment by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in favor of appellees, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the National Indian Gaming Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose after the BIA decided to take 147 acres of land in Wayland Township, Michigan, into trust for use by an Indian tribe who planned to construct and operate a Class III casino. In regards to the group's first NEPA argument, the 40 C.F.R. &sect; 1501.4(b)-(c) process--environmental assessment (EA) preparation followed by a decision on whether to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS)--was applicable. The Department of the Interior (DOI) followed those procedures and lawfully determined not to prepare an EIS on the basis of the EA. Alternatively, the group contended unsuccessfully that it was arbitrary or capricious for the DOI to issue Findings of No Significant Impact without having prepared an EIS because, as the group alleged, two intersections would continue to experience Level of Service F at certain times, even after mitigation measures. 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 465 was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The statute provided the intelligible principle of providing lands sufficient to enable Indians to achieve self-support and ameliorating the damage resulting from prior federal policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association, a trade organization representing pharmacy benefit managers, sought review of a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which granted summary judgment to appellee, the District of Columbia, in the association's suit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the District of Columbia's AccessRx Act of 2004, D.C. Code &sect; 48-831.01 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the association's preliminary injunction was pending, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld a Maine law that was very similar to the AccessRx Act of 2004. The suit concerning the Maine law had been brought by the association. The district court thus held that the instant suit was barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. On appeal, the court disagreed, noting that in a non-mutual case, an issue was not precluded if it was one of law and treating it as conclusively determined would inappropriately foreclose opportunities for obtaining reconsideration of the legal rule upon which it was based. This case concerned questions of law and involved non-mutual estoppel because the District had not been party to the first suit. Further, practical considerations counseled against the application of collateral estoppel because the Department of Labor had proposed regulations that would require employee benefit plans to disclose information similar to the disclosures required by the AccessRx Act of 2004, which might impact the question in the instant case of whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 preempted the AccessRx Act of 2004.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the district court's order and remanded the case for reconsideration on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police volunteers appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's dismissal of their claims against defendant police chief challenging, under the First Amendment, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department General Order 101.03's limitation of their rights to organize as a union and argued the Order's at-will dismissal provision violated due process. They also appealed the substitution of the new chief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The new chief's taking office triggered Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d), which automatically substituted the successor of a public officer named in his &quot;official capacity.&quot; The volunteers never sought to assert claims against the former chief in his personal capacity. The Order restricted the &quot;right to organize for collective bargaining purposes,&quot; which was naturally understood as the right to engage in collective bargaining -- i.e., the right to force labor negotiations. It left the volunteers' First Amendment rights intact because while the U.S. Constitution guaranteed workers the right individually or collectively to voice their views to their employers, it did not afford them the right to compel employers to engage in a dialogue or even to listen. Because District of Columbia law did not generally treat the volunteers as &quot;members of the police force&quot; in the sense necessary to protect their tenure under D.C. Code &sect; 5-127.01, the volunteers remained subject to at-will dismissal, and they lacked the statutorily-protected property interest necessary to ground a due process challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an Algerian national detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as an enemy combatant (detainee), filed an interlocutory appeal challenging a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, preliminarily declining to grant him interim relief by barring his transfer to Algeria, where he alleged he would be tortured, while his habeas corpus petition was pending. Appellees included the U.S. President.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When it refused to bar the detainee's transfer to Algeria, the district court had not yet ruled on the detainee's habeas petition because the constitutionality of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366, 120 Stat. 2600, which removed lower court jurisdiction over detainees' habeas petitions, was pending review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeals court treated the district court's order declining to bar the detainee's transfer as a denial of a preliminary injunction, which was appealable under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1292(a)(1). The appeals court held that the district court had authority to grant the detainee interim relief because the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 2, colorably protected his pending habeas corpus claims. Additionally, &sect; 7(a) of the MCA, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e), did not displace the district court's remedial powers under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1651, to issue an auxiliary writ in aid of jurisdiction that already existed, i.e., the jurisdiction to determine whether the MCA was constitutional. Otherwise, the detainee's transfer would make it impossible for the district court to entertain his colorable constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's denial of interim relief and remanded for the district court to decide whether a preliminary injunction should be issued in the detainee's favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found &quot;valid existing rights&quot; (VER) in 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1272(e) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) ambiguous and deferred to defendant Secretary of the Interior's interpretation. Plaintiff mining association appealed, challenging the interpretation in 30 C.F.R. &sect; 761.5 as foreclosing surface mining in sensitive areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over 30 years, VER had been interpreted by five administrations. That Congress presented so wide a range of plausible interpretations to a rulemaking agency showed a delegation of the power to make reasonable adjustments. VER was subject to divergent interpretations; it was ambiguous. Alternative definitions of &quot;right&quot; indicated that the statute was open to interpretation. The Secretary had considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion as evidenced by his 72-page preamble to &sect; 761.5, and the interpretation was reasonable. Protecting against the harmful effects of surface mining was the primary aim of the SMCRA. Several uses of &quot;property&quot; in the SMCRA ran counter to miners' property rights. In 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1272(e), Congress simply declared surface mining off limits for those who had no valid existing rights. It created no process that was denied. Takings claims could be pursued in the United States Court of Federal Claims; such challenges raised no serious question to preclude Chevron deference. No &quot;identifiable class&quot; of miners was shown whose takings claims would expose the government to huge liability; thus, there was no serious constitutional problem to be avoided.</SPAN></P>

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia affirmed. Appealing, the demonstrator argued the permit requirement was facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment and there was no evidence of mens rea because the case was prosecuted on a strict liability premise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nothing significant in the regulations or legislative history indicated that a strict liability regime was adopted. Thus, a mens rea requirement was implied and &sect; 7.96(g)(2) was not facially unconstitutional for want of a mens rea requirement. But, the prosecution proceeded on the erroneous strict liability premise, thus relieving the prosecution of its burden to prove mens rea, i.e., what the demonstrator knew, heard, and intended. The Government successfully objected to attempts to offer evidence of knowledge and intent. The Government was allowed to prosecute the demonstrator for a crime that did not exist, thus, she was denied a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. It was not harmless error. The verdict was not rendered by a jury, so no jury instructions or other steps were readily available to lessen the gravity of the magistrate's erroneous legal conclusion. While the demonstrator had testified she &quot;didn't know she needed a permit,&quot; that may have only indicated that she thought the original permit, that included the White House sidewalk, was still in effect. A new trial was warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was affirmed except as to the claim of error for lack of evidence of mens rea because the case was prosecuted on a strict liability premise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), the Geneva Conventions, and the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, filed by plaintiff former detainees at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, against defendants, the Secretary of Defense and military officers, that alleged illegal detention and torture, but denied dismissal of the RFRA claim. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General had certified under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2679(d)(1) that the alleged conduct was incidental to authorized conduct, and the alleged abuse was tied exclusively to being detained and interrogated in a military prison. Even serious criminal conduct against the detainees could have been foreseeable. Because the alleged conduct came within the scope of defendants' employment, the ATS and Geneva Conventions claims were properly restyled as claims against the United States governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act and were properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for a failure to exhaust under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2675(a). Any Fifth and Eighth Amendment claims were subject to qualified immunity as it was not clear that those rights applied to non-resident aliens. Precedent regarding leased military bases supported the conclusion that Guantanamo was not a United States territory.

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied the request for fees on the ground that the not-for-profit organization had not substantially prevailed in its litigation. The not-for-profit organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The not-for-profit organization submitted a request to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking records regarding applications to conduct clinical trials that involve xenotransplantation and past and present clinical trials involving xenotransplantation. The instant court held that the trial court's decision that FDA's Vaughn indices were inadequate, and subsequent order requiring FDA to produce new indices, did not constitute judicial relief under the Buckhannon standard. Therefore, the not-for-profit organization could not successfully claim to be a prevailing party based upon those decisions. However, the not-for-profit organization was a prevailing party by virtue of a September 24, 2004 memorandum opinion and order. The trial court's final order in this case--requiring FDA to release documents--was sufficient judicial relief to make the not-for-profit organization a prevailing party. This was not a case in which FDA voluntarily released the documents covered by the trial court's order. The agency released the disputed documents only after the order was issued, and it released the documents pursuant to that order.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that one petitioner's challenge to the validity of the EBR exemption fell outside the scope of the 2006 rulemaking, and the second petitioner lacked Article III standing. As to the first petitioner, the FCC's prospective rescission of the EBR exemption in 2003 placed petitioner's challenge to that exemption outside the scope of the 2006 rulemaking. Given the absence of any indication in either notice of proposed rulemaking that the FCC intended to re-examine its statutory authority in 1992 to adopt an EBR exemption, there was no basis for the court to conclude that the FCC reopened the issue in the 2006 rulemaking. The second petitioner failed to demonstrate that facsimile advertisers would respond differently if the court were to require the FCC to revise its order to strike references to &quot;permit&quot; and substitute &quot;does not prohibit&quot; in referring to the JFPA's relationship to unsolicited faxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a meat processing plant, its president, and a trade association, appealed a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissing their claims against defendants, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), for lack of jurisdiction. The parties sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act and money damages under Bivens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president alleged that FSIS officials violated the First Amendment by using USDA enforcement powers to retaliate for statements he made about USDA's handling of a bacterial outbreak at the plant. The trade association represented small meat processors subject to USDA inspection. On appeal, the court held that the district court erred by finding that the failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6912(e). The Act did not create a jurisdictional bar to judicial review of USDA actions but merely established a mandatory, but nonjurisdictional, exhaustion requirement. However, the president and the plant lacked standing under U.S. Const. art. III because they failed to exhaust their remedies under 9 C.F.R. &sect; 306.5. Their injunctive and declaratory relief claims were moot because the plant had been sold, and their Bivens claims were subject to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6912(e). The trade association had standing to sue but its claims were unripe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a wholesale produce merchant and its president, sought review pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2342(2) of an order of respondent, the United States Department of Agriculture, which revoked the merchant's license to do business under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 499a et seq., and triggered restrictions on the president's ability to work in the produce industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrative proceedings resulted after a part owner and officer of the merchant pleaded guilty to bribing a federal produce inspector and admitted making similar payments for over a decade. A Judicial Officer agreed that the merchant had violated 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 499b(4) and that the president and other officers were responsibly connected to the merchant under the respondeat superior provision of 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 499h(b) to bar the president from working for any other licensee for at least a year. The court denied the petition for review under the deferential standard of 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 706(2). The Judicial Officer properly rejected petitioners' claim that the bribes made over a decade were the result of extortion. Even if the payments were induced by extortion, the type of extortion was not a reasonable cause under PACA for the merchant's failure to perform the implied duty to refrain from bribing produce inspectors. Further, the court found no fault in the application of 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 499p to the impose liability on the merchant because the statute required imputation of wrongful conduct to the licensee merchant in every case and not simply in cases where damage was done.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entering a conditional plea of guilty, defendant appealed a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which denied his motion to dismiss a drug and firearm indictment against him. Defendant argued that a magistrate's dismissal with prejudice of the original complaint under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3161(b), 3162(a)(1), precluded prosecution under a subsequent indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at a license-and-inspection roadblock after an officer saw him violate an open container law and after he resisted a pat-down search. Cocaine and a gun were seized from his person. A magistrate dismissed with prejudice a drug and firearms complaint because the government failed to file an indictment within 30 days of arrest under the Speedy Trial Act. Defendant was later indicted. The district court found that the magistrate lacked authority under the Federal Magistrate's Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 636(b)(1)(A), to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and refused to dismiss the indictment. On appeal, the court declined to address whether the magistrate had authority to dismiss the complaint with prejudice because it agreed with the district court that the magistrate, by summarily signing the dismissal order without holding a hearing, failed to give adequate reasons for dismissal as required by 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3162(a)(1), (2). The district court was not precluded by local court rule from reviewing the magistrate's dismissal order. Based on insufficient evidence in the record, the court remanded on the question of whether the roadblock stop violated the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment that the magistrate judge improperly dismissed the complaint with prejudice and affirmed the court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. Because there were insufficient findings and evidence from which to assess the constitutionality of the roadblock, the court remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant congressional office appealed a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia denying its motion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), which sought the return of all materials seized by appellee United States and agents of the Executive Branch that executed a search warrant for nonlegislative materials in the congressional office of a sitting Member of Congress. No Fourth Amendment  search issue was raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the procedures under which the search of the congressional office was conducted protected the legislative privilege in the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, cl. 1. The district court gave prior approval for a warrant procedure that required a Justice Department filter team to scrutinize seized paper and electronic documents for privilege prior to their being turned over to the prosecution. On appeal, the court held that the Clause's absolute testimonial privilege barred disclosure of written and electronic legislative materials. The filtering procedures outlined in the warrant affidavit violated the Clause because they denied the Member any opportunity to identify and assert the privilege with respect to legislative materials before their compelled disclosure to Executive agents. However, the remedy for violating the Clause did not require the return of all documents seized. Although the Clause required that all privileged materials be returned to the Member, unprivileged materials were properly retained by the prosecution under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) because the member did not demonstrate irreparable harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that all legislative materials, originals and copies, that were privileged under the Speech and Debate Clause and seized pursuant to a warrant search of the Member's congressional office, be returned to the Member. The court continued the district court's order barring federal agents who executed the warrant from disclosing the contents of documents seized and from being involved in the criminal prosecution of the Member.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner companies sought review of a final rule of respondent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which amended drug and alcohol testing regulations, on the ground that it impermissibly expanded the scope of employees tested under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45102(a)(1) of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act (Act); Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 701-06; and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 2006 rule amended FAA regulations to mandate that air carriers require tests of all employees of its contractors and subcontractors, at any tier, who performed safety-related functions. The court upheld the substance of the rule because the FAA reasonably included all subcontractors among the contractors whose employees were &quot;other air carrier employees&quot; subject to testing in 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45102(a)(1). The rule did not violate the APA because the FAA gave the companies opportunity to comment and reasonably determined that it was inconsistent with aviation safety to treat employees of certificated and noncertificated contractors differently. The court held that the rule did not subject employees of noncertificated subcontractors to an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment or violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the regulated enterprise had the ability to clarify the rule's meaning. However, the court remanded the case for the FAA to conduct an analysis required by 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, treating the contractors and subcontractors as regulated entities who had responsibilities directly imposed on them by the rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the substance of the rule but remanded the case for the limited purpose of conducting the analysis required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, treating the contractors and subcontractors as regulated entities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel, holding that appellant taxpayer's compensatory damages award was not exempt under I.R.C. &sect; 104(a)(2), and not &quot;income&quot; under the Sixteenth Amendment, reversed the grant of summary judgment to appellees United States and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The government's motion for rehearing en banc was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award was not received on account of personal physical injuries excludable from gross income under I.R.C. &sect; 104(a)(2). Although she may have suffered physical symptoms of stress, the award focused on mental pain and anguish. Gross income under I.R.C. &sect; 61 included compensatory damages for non-physical injuries. The court had to presume that when I.R.C. &sect; 104(a) was amended in 1966, the presumption that it was intended to have real and substantial effect suggested that I.R.C. &sect; 61 was to be read to include an award for nonphysical harms. Thus, &sect; 61 implicitly included a nonphysical damages award such as the taxpayer received, regardless if it was an accession to wealth. A tax upon such damages was within Congress's power. The taxpayer was taxed only after receiving a compensatory award, thus, it was akin to a duty upon the facilities made use of and actually employed in the transaction. The tax laid upon an award of damages for a nonphysical personal injury operated with &quot;the same force and effect&quot; throughout the United States and therefore was uniform under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attache sought review of a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which granted appellee government's Fed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that employees of the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) eavesdropped on the attache's telephone conversation. The court affirmed the dismissal of the claim against the classified CIA employee. The court held that the district court, after an ex parte and in camera review, did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the state secrets privilege of the United States as to reports on internal investigations of the attache's allegations because releasing the reports would have risked revealing covert operatives. The court reversed the dismissal of the claim against the State Department employee because it was peripheral to national security concerns and the attache, without using the privileged information, could have established a prima facie case through inconsistencies in the employee's explanation of how he learned of the conversation and the employee's cable that included the attache's conversation in quotation marks and ellipses, creating an inference that the conversation was transcribed. The court held that the district court made no finding that a valid defense for the State Department employee precluded the continuation of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g)(1). He appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during an inventory search of his vehicle following his arrest for moving violations. He was alone in the vehicle when he was arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) and driving under the influence (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the arresting officers failed to follow standard police procedures when they impounded his car and subsequently retrieved a weapon from a trash bag found in the trunk. Prior to impoundment, defendant was not afforded the opportunity to arrange for the car's removal. An officer testified that the officers were required to impound the vehicle because no one was present to remove it, defendant was not the owner, and the police were not going to wait for the owner to remove it. The officer testified that he did not believe that had a choice but to impound the vehicle. The impoundment decision violated D.C. Metro. Police Gen. Order No. 602.1 (602.1). Additionally, since defendant was arrested for OWI and DUI, the impoundment procedures in the Comprehensive Anti-Drunk Driving Amendments Act of 1991 (Act), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-2201.05(c-1) rendered 602.1's impoundment procedures obsolete. The officers' impoundment decision led to an inventory search that also violated 602.1. Since the vehicle was taken to a private impound lot, a search of the vehicle was expressly forbidden by 602.1.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the union did not commit an unfair labor practice under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 158(b)(4)(ii)(B) because it had not threatened the store but informed it of its intent to lawfully protest. The union had no statutory obligation to assure the hospital, a neutral employer, that its picketing would be lawful or limited to a reserved gate. The mock funeral procession, a type of secondary boycott, was not the functional equivalent of picketing. Although a videotape showed that some protesters carried signs urging the public not to patronize the hospital, the procession was not intimidating because it was orderly and occurred 100 feet from the hospital.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Class action plaintiffs, intellectually disabled persons who lived in defendant District of Columbia (D.C.) facilities and received medical services from the D.C., appealed a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, permanently enjoining defendant Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration (MRDDA) from authorizing elective surgeries for patients under its 2003 policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class plaintiffs, who never had the mental capacity to make medical decisions for themselves, argued that the 2003 MRDDA policy violated the Health Care Decisions Act, D.C. Code &sect; 21-2201 et seq., as well as their Fifth Amendment and substantive due process rights, by authorizing surgeries without considering their wishes. The district court agreed. On appeal, the court held that the 2003 policy comported with the Act because the policy permitted the MRDDA administrator to authorize medical decisions only if two physicians certified that a surgery was clinically indicated to maintain the health of the patient; the caregivers had made efforts to discuss the surgery with the patient at the level of patient comprehension; and no guardian, family member, or other close relative, friend, or associate was available to consent. The &quot;best interests&quot; rather than the &quot;known wishes&quot; standard applied, once the administrator had ascertained that a patient was unable to make an informed decision on his or her own behalf, because considering the wishes of a patient who had always lacked mental capacity could result in the incorrect denial of medical treatment or cause death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment, vacated the district court's injunction, and directed the entry of judgment for D.C. and MRDDA with respect to the class plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court declined to address the class plaintiffs' individual damage claims that stemmed from incidents that had occurred more than 10 years previously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant consumer advocacy group sought judicial review of appellee United States District Court for the District of Columbia's dismissal of its complaint challenging the validity of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Act), Pub. L. No. 109-171, 120 Stat. 4 (2006), and denial of its motion for summary judgment. The district court held that the group's bicameralism claim was foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court's Marshall Field decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group asserted that the Act was invalid because the bill that was presented to the President did not first pass both chambers of Congress in the exact same form. It asserted that it was irrelevant that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate both signed a version of the proposed legislation identical to the version signed by the President. The group also argued that it did not matter that the congressional leaders' signatures attested that indistinguishable legislative text passed both houses. In the present case, the record contained a copy of the Act bearing the signatures of then Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate. Where such an attested enrolled bill existed, the Marshall Field decision required that the judicial department act upon that assurance and accept the bill as having passed Congress. The group argued unsuccessfully to distinguish and narrow the Marshall Field decision. There was no doubt that the application of the group's theory to the case was positively foreclosed by the Marshall Field decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case arising from a decision by appellee District of Columbia (District), to renovate a shopping center, appellants, several property owners, tenants, and a shopping center employee, sought judicial review of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's dismissal of their complaint on the ground that the just compensation challenge was not ripe.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the complaint included a just compensation challenge, a central allegation in the complaint was that the taking would not serve a public purpose. The district court granted the District's Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, holding that its review of Fifth Amendment challenges was premature until a taking occurred, and the District provided, or fails to provide, compensation. In treating appellants' claims under the Fifth Amendment as just compensation claims, the district court overlooked their public use claim, which was not subject to the Williamson County decision's ripeness requirements. While appellants also raised due process and equal protection claims, since their focus was on their public use claim, only the public use claim was remanded to the district court. Finally, appellant's challenge to the District's authority was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of appellants' public use claim as unripe was reversed, and that part of the case was remanded. Upon remand, the district court should address the District's other grounds for dismissal of the complaint, including the standing of individual appellants, res judicata as may arise from the condemnation proceedings in the District of Columbia courts, and, in its discretion, abstention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed for leave to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2255 habeas petition, asserting that his sentence was illegal under Booker. The inmate filed his first habeas petition prior to the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and claimed that this request for leave therefore should be evaluated under the pre-AEDPA &quot;cause and prejudice&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate conceded that he did not meet either of the standards in 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2255 for filing a second or successive habeas corpus petition. Under the pre-AEDPA standard, the inmate could not show prejudice because Booker was not retroactive. That being the case, the appellate court did not need to consider whether the inmate had shown cause. While Booker announced a new rule, neither exception to the general rule of non-retroactivity applied to make Booker retroactive on collateral review. The inmate contended that Booker was substantive because it made the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines that altered the applicable sentencing range based on the finding of a particular fact an element of the underlying crime that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. That contention misapprehended the significance of Booker. As to whether Booker was a watershed rule, the inmate argued that Booker was on par with Gideon. Both his arguments in support of the contention failed. Booker did not meet the criteria for retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since 1999, plaintiffs engaged in a nationwide effort to get the government to answer specific questions regarding what plaintiffs viewed as the government's violation of the taxing, war powers, money, and privacy clauses of the Constitution. Plaintiffs submitted petitions with extensive lists of inquiries to various government agencies in the Legislative and Executive Branches but never received responses. In particular, plaintiffs contended that the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, and Congress neglected their responsibilities under the First Amendment to respond to plaintiffs' petitions. The court disagreed. U.S. Supreme Court precedent unequivocally held that the First Amendment's Petition Clause did not provide a right to a response or official consideration. The Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7421(a), precluded plaintiffs' second claim, which sought to enjoin the government from the collection of taxes.</SPAN></P>

The opposition member was subject to the Committee's rules on disclosing information and the House of Representatives' ethics rules. Just as the First Amendment did not protect him from House disciplinary proceedings, it did not protect him from civil suit liability, which rested on a violation of a federal statute. When he became a member of the Committee, he accepted a duty of confidentiality that covered his receipt and handling of the recording. He thus had no First Amendment right to disclose the tape to the media. And, a subcommittee had found that the disclosure not only violated the spirit of the rules but also the opposition member's obligations as Ranking Minority Member.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government filed a motion seeking a rehearing en banc of an appellate panel's decision holding that a warrantless search of defendant's car was not a search incident to arrest, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, and reversing a judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers saw defendant urinating outside a car in an industrial area in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-1321 (2001). Noticing a passenger inside the car, an officer leaned part of his upper body inside the open window and, using a flashlight, saw open containers of an alcoholic beverage. A vehicle search revealed a loaded pistol in a backpack on the back seat. Defendant was charged with a firearms violation, possession of an open container of alcohol, and urinating in public. The district court denied his motion to suppress evidence based on an illegal warrantless search. The panel majority reversed, reasoning that even when police had probable cause to arrest, they could not conduct a warrantless search incident to arrest before taking a suspect into custody. Sitting en banc, the appeals court disagreed. Under the U.S. Supreme Court's Rawlings rule, a warrantless search could constitutionally precede an arrest as long as a formal arrest followed quickly on the heels of the search. Police reasonably inferred that defendant was a recent occupant of the car. As the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for urinating in a public place, the search was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought extension of the Batson rule to the blind, on the ground that, in the Lane decision, the United States Supreme Court recognized that states deprived disabled individuals of a fundamental right by excluding them from jury service. The reasoning in the Lane decision did not support defendant's contention that the exercise of peremptory challenges of individual jurors on the basis of disability related to the particular case triggered heightened scrutiny or violated the Batson rule. Defendant's alternate contention failed that the prosecutor's peremptory strikes were not rational because the charges against him did not rely on visual evidence and to the extent the government chose to introduce such evidence it was, by reason of technical defects, virtually useless to the jury. It was not necessarily irrational to think that a person was likely to acquire a more accurate understanding of a scene by seeing it rather than merely hearing about it. The government argued that the district court committed a Fanfan error at resentencing. The district court plainly erred by failing to appreciate the sentencing authority that it retained after the Booker decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g)(1). In determining his sentence, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that his prior conviction of first-degree sexual abuse of a ward constituted a crime of violence, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 4B1.2(a), which led to a significant enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 2K2.1(b)(2). This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant did not challenge the finding that first-degree sexual abuse of a ward was a crime of violence. Thus, the issue was reviewed for plain error only, Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), and was limited to whether oral sex with a ward, as a categorical determination, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 4B1.2(a)(2). Two factors, sufficient to withstand plain error review, suggested that the crime, as defined in D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-3013 (formerly D.C. Code &sect; 22-4113) and &sect; 22-4101(8) (1998) (repealed 2000), presented a serious potential risk of physical injury. First, there was a potential risk of injury that was inherent in the coercive nature of the supervisor-ward relationship. Since consent was not a defense to the crime, D.C. Code &sect; 22-3017 (formerly D.C. Code &sect; 22-4117), District of Columbia legislators apparently believed there was an inherent power imbalance in the relationship. There was also a risk of exposing the victim to sexually transmitted infections. It was not obvious, then, that first-degree sexual abuse of a ward did not constitute a crime of violence, and the district court did not plainly err in so finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public employee filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against appellee, a mayor's former chief of staff, in his individual and official capacities. The employee alleged that she was not selected for a position in retaliation for the exercise of her First Amendment rights. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the chief of staff's motion for summary judgment. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While acting as the interim director of the District of Columbia's Office of Human Rights (OHR), the employee suggested that the denial of her salary requests for OHR job applicants was motivated by the racial and gender discrimination. The employee claimed that her supervisor told her that the employee was not selected to be the permanent director due to the chief of staff's retaliation against the employee for her discrimination allegations. Although the employee's notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days of the summary judgment order, the court determined that the appeal was timely because the employee's Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration was deemed to have tolled the 30-day period where the chief of staff failed to assert the timeliness defense afforded by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi). The court found that the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on its conclusion that the supervisor's statements to the employee were not admissible as an admission of the District. The court held that the employee could not establish a First Amendment claim because the employee did not speak as a citizen when she made the discrimination allegations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant District of Columbia (District) residents challenged appellee District's gun laws, D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 7-2502.02(a)(4), 7-2507.02, 22-4504 (insofar as &sect; 22-4504 prevented carrying a pistol in a registrant's home). The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the complaint, holding that the Second Amendment bestowed no individual rights except, perhaps, when serving in an organized militia such as the National Guard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were no allegations the residents were singled out for prosecution and nothing showed they were punished for their challenges. Only one resident, a police officer, had applied for and been denied a handgun registration. Only he had an injury independent of prospective enforcement, and an injury to which the pre-enforcement standing requirements did not apply. Since D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 7-2507.02, 22-4504, amounted to further conditions on his registration, he had standing. Handgun registration was not completely prohibited. &quot;The right of the people,&quot; in the Second Amendment, when read intratextually and in light of United States Supreme Court precedent, led to the conclusion that the right was individual. All other Bill of Rights provisions, excepting the Tenth Amendment, protected rights citizens enjoyed in their individual capacity. The Second Amendment's operative clause included a private meaning for &quot;bear Arms.&quot; D.C. Code &sect; 7-2507.02 would reduce a pistol to being useless. It, like the bar on carrying a pistol in the home under D.C. Code &sect; 22-4504, amounted to a complete unconstitutional prohibition on the lawful use of handguns for self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the Act contained elements of federal law, neither party suggested that the two readings requirement was anything other than local law. The challenged action was a moratorium on the sale of certain single container liquor sales within a particular ward of the District. The licensees' most substantial claim that the District violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by denying the affected licensees individualized notice and an opportunity to be heard was foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court's Bi-Metallic decision. The licensees' allegations that: (1) there was a violation of the substantive component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, (2) the moratorium violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, (3) the moratorium effected an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment, and (4) the statute was void for vagueness all failed. In light of the insubstantiality of the licensees' federal claims, the district court lacked federal-question jurisdiction over those claims and thus supplemental jurisdiction over the claim under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the United States Agency for International Development and its administrator (collectively USAID), sought review of a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which struck down a funding condition under 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7631(f) of United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act. Appellee, an international organization, was denied funding for its refusal to comply with provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization provided family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention programming in foreign countries and refused to certify that it had a policy opposing prostitution, as required under &sect; 7631(f). The district court found that the certification violated the organization's First Amendment rights. On review, the court reversed. The government's objective under 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7601 of the Act was to eradicate HIV/AID, and a means for accomplishing the objective was to speak out against legalizing prostitution and to foster behavioral change under &sect; 7601(22)(E) and to spread educational messages under 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7611. The USAID did not violate the First Amendment because the government's own message was being delivered and the government was entitled to take appropriate steps to ensure that its message was neither garbled nor distorted, especially where the government was speaking on matters with foreign policy implications. The Act did not compel the organization to advocate the government's position on prostitution and sex trafficking; it only required that if the organization wanted to receive grant funds, it had to communicate the message the government chose to fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants and cross-appellants, alien detainees, filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The dismissal of some detainees' claims was reversed; on remand to the district court, those detainees' claims were dismissed in part. Other detainees' cases were dismissed in their entirety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainees were aliens who were captured outside the United States and detained as enemy combatants at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. The court of appeals found that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) amended 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e) so as to eliminate jurisdiction in the federal courts over the detainees' claims. The MCA, Pub. L. No. 109-366, &sect; 7(b), 120 Stat. 2600, provided that the amendment to the habeas statute was applicable to all cases, without exception, that were pending on or after the date of the MCA's enactment where those cases related to any aspect of the detention of an alien who had been detained by the United States as an enemy combatant since September 11, 2001. The MCA's deprivation of jurisdiction over the detainees' habeas petitions did not violate the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 2; the Suspension Clause protected the writ as it existed in 1789, and habeas corpus would not have been available in 1789 to aliens held at an overseas military base leased from a foreign government. Further, the U.S. Constitution did not confer rights on aliens without property or presence within the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to distributing more than five grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 841(a)(1) , (b)(1)(B)(iii). On remand, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia sentenced him to 121 months of imprisonment. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agreed that for sentencing purposes he was accountable for more than 50 grams but less than 150 grams of crack. Using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (Guidelines), the district court, on remand, calculated defendant's sentencing range as 121 to 151 months, and sentenced him to 121 months. The issue on appeal was whether the district court committed a legal error when it declined to consider the 100-to-1 ratio perpetuated in U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 2D1.1 and the problems it raised in sentencing crack cocaine dealers. The appellate court found that the district court erred when it refused to evaluate whether sentencing defendant in accordance with &sect; 2D1.1, and its 100-to-1 ratio, would effectuate the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3553(a). The Sentencing Commission had candidly and forthrightly exposed the weaknesses and failings of its Guideline with respect to crack cocaine sentencing. That sentences after Booker would not be as uniform as sentences before Booker was doubtless true, but this was a consequence of the United States Supreme Court's decision to treat the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an Islamic relief agency, appealed a summary judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in favor of government defendants including the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department of the Treasury (OFAC), in the agency's Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 701 et seq., suit challenging the blocking of its assets after its parent organization was designated a sponsor of terrorism.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assets of the relief agency, which was located in the U.S., were blocked after its parent organization, which was located overseas, was designated a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). Although the relief agency was not independently designated an SDGT, OPAC considered it to be a branch office of the designated organization. On an issue of first impression. the court rejected the relief agency's argument that the &quot;alias test,&quot; which required proof of whether a designated organization controlled a non-designated organization, applied. The government's theory was that the relief agency was a branch office of a single global terrorist organization. Reviewing the unclassified record, the court agreed. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1701(a)(1)(B), granted OPAC the authority to block terrorist assets. Under the APA's deferential standard of review, the government defendants did not act arbitrarily. Under the First and Fifth Amendments, the agency had no protected right to fund terrorism. However, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), the district court failed to consider whether the agency could amend its complaint to add a prayer for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in all respects except that it remanded to the district court to consider whether the relief agency should be permitted to amend its complaint.</SPAN></P>

Regs. tit. 7, &sect; 124.9 (2015) provided that benefits were to be reinstated as of the date of compliance, but did not mention retroactive payments; [2]-The Federal Employees' Compensation Appeals Board had interpreted identical language in 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 8123(d) (2012) to preclude retroactive payment of benefits that were suspended for failure to submit to a medical examination; [3]-The claimant's argument that the failure to provide him retroactive benefits constituted a taking without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

Bar R. XIII; accordingly, the firm was deemed to have agreed to arbitrate the fee dispute; [3]-The court of appeals did not exceed its authority in promulgating Rule XIII; [4]-Rule XIII did not violate the firm's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, as it gave up that right by practicing law in the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the District of Columbia, instituted a juvenile delinquency proceeding in which a 15 year old minor was charged with unlawful possession of a BB gun. A judge in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia held that the minor's incriminating statement was obtained in violation of Miranda and granted the minor's motion to suppress the statement. The judge denied the District's petition for reconsideration. The District appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the District contended that the boy was not in custody for Fifth Amendment Miranda purposes at the time that he made the statement, and that therefore there was no violation of Miranda. The appellate court found that on the record, no person of the minor's age, and in his circumstances, could reasonably have believed that he was under arrest or its equivalent. The appellate court found that the judge erred by failing to distinguish between the relatively simple question whether, at the time the officer inquired if the minor had anything on him, the boy had been seized, which he indisputably had been, and the more complicated issue whether the minor was also in custody as that term was used in Miranda and in the cases applying that decision. Indeed, beyond the bare fact of temporary seizure to transport the minor to his home nearby for purposes of investigation, there was nothing that the officer did that could plausibly be perceived, from the minor's perspective or any other, as coercive, or as though he was being arrested. Because the undisputed evidence showed that the minor had been detained but was not in Miranda custody, the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney was charged with violating D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5, 1.15, 1.16, and 8.4. After the hearing committee made its findings, the Board on Professional Responsibility found that the attorney violated D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) and recommended a sixth-month suspension with reinstatement subject to disgorgement of the unreasonable fee. The matter was before the court on the Board's report and recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Once the fact of dispute was conveyed, disputed funds had to be placed in a separate interest-bearing account. D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(c). Commingling the disputed funds with attorney funds resulted in a violation of D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(a) and (c). The attorney did not place the disputed funds into a separate account until nine months after he was aware of a dispute. Thus, he commingled disputed funds with his own funds in violation of D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(a) and (c). Although D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(c) stated that any funds in dispute shall be deposited in a separate account, it did not specify whether funds must be restored to a separate account if the dispute arose after funds had already been disbursed. In the instant case, the court found that the funds should have been restored to a separate account. The court held that if a client in any future matter, with reasonable promptness, disputed an attorney's fee after the attorney had already withdrawn his fee from the client trust account, the attorney must place the disputed amount in a separate account pursuant to D.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(a). What was reasonable promptness would be a case-specific inquiry.</SPAN></P>

Defendant one responded favorably to inpatient treatment and medication and was allowed to remain at the hospital instead of returning to the jail. The Act's hearing requirement could be modified with the parties' consent, and neither party objected. The denial of defendants one's and two's motions to sever under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 14 was proper. They did not identify any specific right that was compromised by the denial. Defendant three's testimony was subject to cross-examination. The jury acquitted defendants of the most serious charges, and differentiated defendant two by convicting him of one minor count. Defendant three's claim that it was error to refuse to allow him to present evidence of the victim's bad acts out of order was rejected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a first-degree murder he committed as a juvenile and was sentenced to a mandatory 30-year term under former D.C. Code &sect; 22-2404 (Supp. 2004), now codified at D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-2104. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia denied defendant's brief after construing it as a motion to correct an illegal sentence under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that defendant did not fit into the categorical exceptions of Roper, Graham, or Miller. The Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, required the State to give the juvenile non-homicide offender a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. Defendant would have that opportunity after his minimum sentence was completed. Defendant's sentence did not guarantee that he would die in prison. The mitigating qualities of defendant's youth were taken into account in &sect; 22-2404(a) as it limited the minimum sentence to 30 years' for offenders under the age of 18 at the time of their offense. The mandatory nature of the sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment. The trial judge referred the matter for report and sentencing because after service of 30 years', matters in mitigation could be considered by the parole authorities. Defendant kidnapped a 12-year-old boy, drove to an apartment, retrieved a gun, drove to the woods, marched the boy into the middle of the woods, and shot him twice, once in the back of the head in an execution style murder. Defendant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate to his crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in a joint trial which found defendant guilty of fleeing from a law enforcement officer and acquitted him of the other charges. The jury found codefendants guilty of, inter alia, voluntary manslaughter (as a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder), and assault with a dangerous weapon. They were acquitted of murder and other offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from an encounter between the occupants of two vehicles carrying defendant and codefendants that left one victim dead and another injured. The appellate court held the trial court properly found codefendant competent to stand trial based on an evaluation at a hospital, corroboration by codefendant's satisfactory behavior at trial, his responses to an inquiry, and a doctor's post-trial report and assessment. Counsel's report of communication problems, by itself, did not suffice to raise a substantial doubt about his competence to stand trial. As to severance, because the jury acquitted defendants of the most serious charges and differentiated defendant from codefendants by finding him guilty of a comparatively minor count, there was no prejudice. Further, defendant failed to show that the disparity in the weight of the evidence compromised a specific trial right or prevented the jury from reliably determining his guilt or innocence. The jury clearly did not find him guilty of anything based on the evidence of codefendants' greater culpability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. One of each of codefendants' possession of a firearm during a crime of violence convictions should be vacated on merger grounds on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for attempted possession of a prohibited weapon, a knife with a metal knuckles handle, claiming that the weapon did not meet the statutory definition of &quot;knuckles,&quot; that D.C. Code &sect; 22-4501(3) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the prohibition infringed upon his Second Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police approached defendant, believing that he matched the description of a suspected robber. Defendant informed the officers that he had a knife and consented to a search of his person. The trial court held that the addition of a blade to the knuckles did not exempt the weapon from the coverage of D.C. Code &sect; 22-4514(a). Defendant acknowledged that his weapon, often called a &quot;trench knife,&quot; &quot;did have a handle that had knuckles on it. However, he argued that because the handle of the trench knife was not separable from the blade itself, his weapon did not fit &sect; 22-4501's definition of knuckles. The appellate court could not accept defendant's argument because it ignored both the statute's language and its evident purpose. The statutory definition aptly described the handle of defendant's weapon, which readily served the same purpose as more traditional knuckles. The handle of a trench knife was designed to enhance the force of a blow with a fist. D.C. Code &sect; 22-4501 was not lacking in fair warning such that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. It therefore was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted him of carrying a pistol without a license in violation of D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed by a corporation that secured for him two Virginia court appointments as a special conservator of the peace. He argued that he was exempt from prosecution under the exceptions for law enforcement officers contained in D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-4505, 7-2502.01(b)(1), and 7-2506.01(a)(2). (2009 Supp.). The court of appeals held that the limited exemptions that permitted law enforcement officers to carry weapons and ammunition in the District of Columbia did not apply to defendant. Defendant, who only possessed authority to act in a law enforcement capacity while he was working for his private employer, was not a &quot;law enforcement officer&quot; within the meaning of the statutory provisions. Outside of specific times when he was working, he did not have general police authority or authorization to carry a gun. Because defendant was neither a law enforcement officer with general authority nor an individual with limited law enforcement authority who was acting within the scope of his authority, he was not considered a law enforcement officer for purposes of &sect; 22-4505. Defendant was also not entitled to the exemptions under &sect;&sect; 7-2502.01(b)(1) and 7-2506.01(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

In addition, the appellate court noted that defendant was attuned to what was going on during the trial and pretrial proceedings, cooperated with standby counsel, and assisted in his defense. The appellate court also concluded that the trial court did not err by failing to evaluate his mental health in connection with his proceeding pro se and neglecting to ensure he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, noting that defendant demonstrated his experience with the trial process, handling as assortment of trial tasks. The trial court did err, however in failing to conduct a Frendak inquiry before sentencing defendant, given the new information presented at the hearing calling into question defendant's mental health.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, because the search warrant was limited to the house and the officer lacked probable cause to search the truck. The appellate court found no error, concluding that the trial court was permitted to consider that the officer reasonably identified the smell as burnt marijuana and saw smoke emanating from the truck, but was either honestly mistaken or simply overlooked the evidence of smoke material inside the truck. Defendant also argued that the prosecutor, in rebuttal argument, improperly commented on the reasonable doubt standard and that he was prejudiced by the way the judge resolved counsel's objection. The appellate court held that any error was harmless, as it was the comments by the prosecutor and not the court that defendant argued were misleading and the impact of any misstatements was reduced by the judge's instructions that it was the court's responsibility to apprise the jury as to the law. Finally, the appellate court concluded that evidence that defendant did not return in the afternoon and was not dismissed by a judicial officer supported the conviction for failure to appear.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the District of Columbia Superior Court, defendant was convicted of two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm (UF), in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 7-2502.01(a) (2001), and two counts of unlawful possession of ammunition (UA), in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 7-2506.01(a)(3) (2001). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, 18, was arrested after police found two handguns in his bedroom. He moved to dismiss on the ground the UF and UA statutes infringed on his right to bear arms under the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II. The trial court held that defendant, not having tried to register the guns, was not a liberty to complain. The appellate court noted that under Plummer v. United States, defendant had standing to raise the Second Amendment defense, notwithstanding his failure to attempt to register the guns. The District argued that he was not entitled to a remand for an evidentiary hearing under Plummer as he did not show he could have satisfied the registration requirements applicable to 18-to-20 year-olds set out in D.C. Code &sect; 7-2502.03(a)(1)(A)-(B). The appellate court disagreed. On remand, defendant would have the burden of proving that, before he was charged, he could have obtained a parent's or guardian's notarized written permission to own and use the handguns and a parent's or guardian's notarized written assumption of civil liability. If he failed to meet that burden, under merger principles, only one of his UF convictions and one of his UA convictions could stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remand for an evidentiary hearing. If the trial court determined that defendant could not have qualified for gun registration, it had to nevertheless vacate one of his UF convictions and one of his UA convictions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the judge's failure to do so denied defendant his due process right to a neutral arbiter. The appellate court concluded that defendant waived the issue by failing to object, even after the judge raised the issue. In addition, while the judge's recusal from sitting as the trial of fact clearly would have been warranted had defendant actually admitted his guilt or otherwise incriminated himself, defendant denied the conduct alleged, necessitating the rejection of his plea. Defendant also challenged the admission of items seized into evidence based on a chain of custody issue. While the chain of custody was less than ideal, there was no evidence the police failed to maintain continuous custody or that the evidence was tampered with; thus, any challenge was to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the convictions did not merge, noting that differentiation between audiovisual works and sound recordings in the statute's penalty structure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the District of Columbia entered judgment, upon a jury's verdict, convicting defendant of armed robbery, in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-2801 (2001), and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-4502 (Supp. 2011). The trial court denied defendant's D.C. Code &sect; 23-110 new trial motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The direct appeal and defendant's appeal from the trial court's denial of his &sect; 23-110 motion were consolidated for review. With regard to the direct appeal, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to present an expert witness on the subject of identification testimony. However, the corroborative evidence establishing the accuracy of the victim's identification was notable, thus making any assumed error as to the expert testimony harmless. Next, defendant was not denied a meaningful opportunity to present a defense because he presented his misidentification argument sufficiently through argument and a witness. With regard to defendant's dissatisfaction with his counsel, his statement to the trial court that he &quot;could do better as his own lawyer&quot; was not enough to trigger a Monroe-Farrell inquiry, nor was it a clear and unequivocal declaration of a desire to represent himself. Finally, the trial judge did not plainly err in failing to sua sponte correct the government's use of the term &quot;malarkey.&quot; With regard to the &sect; 23-110 motion, an evidentiary hearing was not required because trial counsel's performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and affirmed the order denying the collateral attack without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to seek suppression of evidence recovered from the scene of an alleged robbery. The trial court assumed that trial counsel should have filed the suppression motion and that the motion would have been successful, but it denied the &sect; 23-110 motion because, in its opinion, the remaining evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. However, the factual record was not sufficiently developed to support a conclusion that a suppression motion would have resulted in the exclusion of a significant amount of evidence. Furthermore, there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of defendant's trial would have been different had some or all of the evidence in question been excluded. Finally, given the deficiencies in the factual record, the appellate court could not have upheld the trial court's denial of the &sect; 23-110 motion on the alternative ground that the motion to suppress would not have resulted in the exclusion of evidence because the evidence seized during a second entry would have been admissible under the plain view doctrine, even though the second entry itself was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the trial court's sentence was unconstitutional in light of Apprendi, because the trial court found three aggravating factors that were not determined by the jury, specifically that the murder was especially heinous, that the crime involved substantial planning, and that the victim was &quot;vulnerable&quot; because of his age of 14 years old.

Defendants argued that the instructions, given without objection, for aiding and abetting as to the AAWA and ADW charges were erroneous. The appellate court held there was no plain error in the aiding and abetting instruction given with respect to ADW, as they fairly apprised the jury that accomplice liability required a finding that defendants either knew or that it was reasonably foreseeable to them that the principal would use a shod foot to kick the victim. But an instruction that allowed the jury to convict them of AAWA as aiders and abettors if they participated in the crime, but stated that they did not need to have the intent to commit the particular crime committed by the principal offender, was erroneous. As the instruction omitted the mens rea element of the offenses charged, the error was of constitutional magnitude. As the law at the time of the appeal was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of trial, the error was clear.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant testified that while she was working as a prostitute, defendant solicited her services, and that after she demanded payment up front, he forced her to have sex with him at gunpoint. He testified that he had sex with her for money and denied using a weapon or force of any kind. The trial court, over defense objection, instructed the jury that it could consider evidence of consent in determining whether the sexual encounter was forcible, and that defendant had the burden of proving consent by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court noted that defendant claimed the complainant had sex with him without coercion, in exchange for cash, and accused him of sexual assault to exact revenge for his refusal to pay her for all the sexual services he enjoyed; he never claimed she was a willing participant despite his having held her at gunpoint. Thus, there was no factual basis for the instructions. Further, the trial court erred in giving the instructions because they were confusing and there was a reasonable likelihood that they led the jury to shift the burden of proof on the element of force from the government to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 23-101(a) to prosecute violations of all &quot;police or municipal ordinances or regulations.&quot; Because the District's statutes banning possession of an unregistered firearm (D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police commanders were demoted. They appealed to the Office of Employee Appeals (OEA), claiming that as Career Service employees they should not have been demoted without cause under the Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act, D.C. Code &sect; 1-601.01 et seq. The OEA held that the chief had authority to reduce their rank without cause. The commanders appealed. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia affirmed. They sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first commander, a Career Service employee, was progressively promoted to the positions of lieutenant, captain, inspector, and commander. The newly appointed chief of police informed the commander that she was returning him to the rank of captain and reassigning him to other duties. At no point did the chief suggest that the first commander's work was inadequate. The second commander, also a Career Service employee, was promoted to the positions of inspector and commander. The chief returned him to the rank of inspector. The plain meaning of the statutory language of D.C. Code &sect; 1-608.01(d-1) was that Career Service employees of the Metropolitan Police Department were included within its reach. Additionally, &sect; 1-608.01(d-1), applied alike to inspectors, commanders, and assistant chiefs of police. Accordingly, pursuant to &sect; 1-608.01(d-1), the mayor, or the chief of police as the mayor's delegee, had explicit discretionary authority to return any officer above the rank of captain to a lower rank, without cause. Because &sect; 1-608.01(d-1) provided the chief with discretionary authority to return any commander to a lower rank, the commanders' constitutional rights were not abridged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for CPWL, arguing that the Second Amendment gave him the right to carry a concealed firearm outside his home or place of business. The appellate court agreed with the Government, that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was under no obligation, as defendant asserted, to recognize that the Second Amendment right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation could not be limited to the confines of the home. Defendant also asserted that the District's statute prohibiting the carrying of a pistol without a license violated the Second Amendment because it amounted to an outright ban on the carrying of pistols. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant's conduct and noting that defendant could not challenge the statute by arguing that it could not be constitutionally applied to other defendants differently situated.</SPAN></P>

The appeal involved a matter of first impression requiring an interpretation of a subsection of the District of Columbia Drug Paraphernalia Act of 1982, D.C. Code &sect; 48-1103 (b) (2001). The appellate court affirmed, stating that the government presented credible, strong and compelling indirect and circumstantial evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time the first defendant sold the glass ink pen and the copper scouring pad to the officer, she and the second defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the buyer would use those items to inject, ingest, or inhale a controlled substance. The trial court credited the officer's account of the sale, that he asked for &quot;an ink pen&quot; and that the first defendant gave him a glass ink pen and a metal scouring pad, even though he did not request a metal scouring pad. The second defendant, the owner of the store, also ordered, stored, and specifically intended to sell items that obviously could be used with illegal drugs, including digital scales, empty ziplock bags, glass ink pens that had little ink, and copper scouring pads.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder, possession of a firearm during a crime of violence (PFCV), and carrying a pistol without a license (CPWL). The first trial resulted in a mistrial. Upon a second trial, defendant was convicted of the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, PFCV, and CPWL.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court's handling of the references to codefendant's guilty plea was reversible error because the references were inadmissible testimonial hearsay that violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause rights and the failure to give a cautionary instruction compounded the prejudice against him, requiring reversal. The appellate court concluded that if there was error on the part of the trial court it was not plain, and any prejudicial effect of the reference to codefendant's plea was minimal and far less than the effect such a reference might have in another circumstance. Defendant also argued that the convictions should be reversed because the court provided an erroneous instruction on aiding and abetting. The appellate court disagreed, noting that it had upheld virtually the same instruction on several other occasions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial, as the proffered newly discovered evidence was not new, but was known to defense counsel, who made strategic decisions on which evidence or testimony to use at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee filed an action for retaliation and defamation against appellant employer. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia held that the employer was entitled to a qualified privilege with respect to the defamation claim. The jury found in favor of the employee on the retaliation claim, awarding her punitive damages under the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (DCHRA), D.C. Code &sect; 2-1401.01 et seq. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a lawsuit against the employer, alleging a DCHRA sexual harassment violation. While the action was pending, the employee fell and was placed on long-term disability. The employee was terminated during her disability absence period, allegedly due to theft of grant funds. However, the employee denied any wrongdoing, claiming that she had ordered certain paper supplies and billed them to her personal account and that the vendor had erred on the invoice. With regard to the retaliation claim, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the employer's post-trial motion because the jury's punitive damages award was not constitutionally excessive. Although the compensatory damage award was nominal, the employer's behavior was reprehensible and the District had a strong interest in deterring DCHRA violations. With regard to the defamation claim, the record supported the summary judgment in favor of the employer based on a qualified privilege. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering reinstatement because it was doubtful that the parties would have been able to maintain a productive and amicable working relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time he was stopped with the weapons, appellant was a 16-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department who had been wrongfully terminated and was working as a technician for an automated teller company until his reinstatement. He had a license to carry a firearm from the Commonwealth of Virginia. He argued that under the Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5902 (2006), the District's gun control laws were preempted. The court held that appellant waived his preemption and Second Amendment claims because he knowingly entered an unconditional guilty plea and these claims were non-jurisdictional in nature. Although he had not waived his ineffectiveness claim that he would not have pleaded guilty if advised as to his statutory preemption claim, that claim failed. The facts did not establish that he was carrying this weapon while acting in the service of his employer as required for preemption under 15 U.S.C. &sect; 5902(a)(2). Rather, he was carrying his loaded weapon through the District on his way to his wife's house at 1 a.m. to sleep prior to going to work the next day.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that while the dog attack itself did not constitute an APO by defendant, he had &quot;intimidated&quot; the officer, within the meaning of &sect; 22-405(b). Defendant argued that his conviction based on words alone was contrary to &sect; 22-405(b) and the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The appellate court held that the words he used to incite a dog attack were not mere words that exempted him from prosecution under &sect; 22-405(b) or gave him a defense under the First Amendment. To convict him under &sect; 22-405(b), the government had to prove only that his words could have a tendency to intimidate those who heard them, not that anyone was actually intimidated. &quot;Intimidate&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and &sect; 22-405(b) was not overbroad. As defendant's words were intended to injure one or more officers, they did not qualify as protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for second-degree murder while armed, PFCV, and CPWL, and the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating that the impact of a re-instruction regarding reasonable doubt was improper. The impact was particularly serious because, however individual jurors would parse the re-instruction, there was a reasonable likelihood that, collectively, the jurors would have gained the overall, and correct, impression that the trial judge was restating the instruction in the government's favor, and thus that the concept of &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; was less stringent than they originally had thought. Once that impression was conveyed, it was virtually tantamount to an indication that the judge believed that defendant was guilty and that the government, therefore, had met its burden of proof. The two instructions in the current case conveyed different meanings when the trial judge, for purposes of re-instruction, not only reworked critical language but also told the jurors to see the instructions in the new light of &quot;some change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted him of possessing cocaine and heroin with intent to distribute. He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the police lacked probable cause to arrest him for possession of an open container of alcohol (POCA), D.C. Code &sect; 25-1001(a) (2001), since the container in question was closed when an officer discovered it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer pulled defendant over for operating a vehicle without headlights. He saw a bottle of alcohol in plain view resting on the floor of the vehicle. The officer placed defendant under arrest and found cocaine and heroin in his pockets. The court of appeals held that the trial court committed no error in denying defendant's motion to suppress. The officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had violated the POCA statute as amended by the new definitional section. Under D.C. Code &sect; 25-101(35) (2001), &quot;open container&quot; meant a bottle, can, or other container that was open or from which the top, cap, cork, seal, or tab seal has at some time been removed. The evidence showed that the bottle of alcohol was unsealed and that its contents had been partially consumed when the officer found it in the vehicle in plain view, on the floor just inches from where defendant had been sitting. There was no due process violation in the government's failure to preserve or produce the actual alcohol bottle. Nothing in the record suggested that the police lost or destroyed the bottle so that defendant could not examine it or make evidentiary use of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenant associations filed actions alleging that the sale of apartment complexes by appellee sellers to appellees, limited liability companies (LLC) and their owners, constituted a sale within the meaning of the Tenants' Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA), D.C. Code &sect; 42-3404.02(a) et seq. (2001). They sought review of orders of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which granted the owners' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the transfer of ownership did not constitute a sale within the meaning of TOPA and that the associations bringing lacked standing to bring the suits. The court of appeals held that summary judgment was appropriately granted for lack of standing against all of the associations except two. Those two associations had statutory standing to bring their respective actions. At the time of the alleged sale those associations qualified as &quot;tenant organizations&quot; within the meaning of the TOPA, D.C. Code &sect; 42-3401.03(18) (2001). None of the associations had associational standing. The court of appeals concluded that the transfers constituted a sale subject to TOPA. The LLC I entities transferred absolute title in the apartment buildings to the LLC II entities as part of an agreement in which a third party, the owners, would thereby gain an interest in the property. After the closing, the sellers no longer owned the properties. TOPA, D.C. Code &sect; 42-3404.02(a) (2001), applied to all sales and did not restrict the requirement of notice to tenants to situations where the sale was only for the purpose of demolition or discontinuance of housing use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals affirmed in part the summary judgments entered in favor of all but two of the associations. It reversed the summary judgments entered against those two associations and the ruling that the transfers did not constitute a sale within the meaning of TOPA, and it remanded those judgments to the trial court further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the consent instructions in an unconstitutional manner. During deliberations the jury expressed confusion about the instructions, and the trial court's supplemental instructions failed to clear away that confusion. At a minimum, the jury's note to the trial court demonstrated the jury's confusion about the burdens of proof. It also tended to show that the jurors had reached the second step of the analysis, which inquired whether defendant had proven consent by a preponderance of the evidence, before deciding whether the government had proven all elements of the offense, including force, beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court's supplemental instruction likely added to the confusion regarding the burdens of proof. Although, the trial court repeatedly and emphatically instructed the jury about the government's burden to prove the element of force beyond a reasonable doubt, that general instruction was not sufficient to overcome the confusion inherent in applying &sect; 22-3007 to the circumstances and increased by the supplemental instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a former probationer who had pled guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, possession of an unregistered firearm, and unlawful possession of ammunition, sought relief from his convictions under D.C. Code &sect; 23-110 (2001) or a writ of error coram nobis, and moved to withdraw his pleas under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(e). The Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Criminal Division, denied relief; he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that in light of District of Columbia v. Heller, which held the District's general ban on possession of usable handguns in the home violated the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II, his guilty pleas were invalid because he was not informed that the government would have to prove the constitutionally of the charged crimes. The appellate court noted that while the cases holding that the statutes to which appellant pled guilty were unconstitutional were given retroactive effect, an unconditional guilty plea waived otherwise available constitutional defenses. However, though appellant did not file a direct appeal alleging his plea was not voluntarily or intelligently made, he might be able to overcome that procedural default by showing he was entitled to relief, via D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(e) or coram nobis, to correct a miscarriage of justice,  i.e., his conviction for conduct that under the Second Amendment could not be criminalized. In holding that he could not show a miscarriage of justice because he was using the guns to protect illegal drugs, the trial court reached that conclusion prematurely because it did not hold an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained criminal history about two felons who were recently released on parole or probation so he could extort sexual favors from them.

The appellate court held that defendant's severance motion was properly denied because evidence of his guilt would have been mutually admissible to prove each offense in separate trials. Evidence of his use of the same forged letter to extort the two victims was closely intertwined evidence and placed his crimes in an understandable context. As the government conceded it failed to prove all of the elements of forgery, those convictions could not stand. The two first-degree sexual abuse convictions, based on penetration with finger and penis, did not merge into one, as these assaults were different in character, but the three lesser-included sexual abuse convictions merged into the two first-degree sexual abuse charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to vacate the forgery convictions, as well as the convictions for the two counts of second-degree, third-degree, and fourth-degree sexual abuse, and to re-sentence defendant accordingly. It affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to sever and his other convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Criminal Division, defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of ammunition (UA), in violation of former D.C. Code &sect; 7-2506.01 (2001) (current version at D.C. Code &sect; 7-2506.01(a) (Supp. 2010)). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based solely on evidence that he possessed handgun ammunition in his home. Subsequently, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the District's general ban on possession of usable handguns in the home violated the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II. As a corollary to Heller, defendant argued, his conviction also violated the Second Amendment. The appellate court agreed. The right to keep and bear arms extended to the possession of handgun ammunition in the home. As it was not proved at trial that defendant was disqualified from exercising his U.S. Const. amend. II rights by, for example, possessing ammunition for an illegal purpose, or by failing to comply with applicable registration requirements, &sect; 7-2506.01 was unconstitutional as applied. The unconstitutionality of his conviction was plain, as he was convicted solely on proof of constitutionally protected conduct. And as convicting him in violation of the Second Amendment unquestionably affected his substantial rights, and seriously impugned the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings, all four prongs of the plain error test were met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney argued that Rule XIII was unconstitutional and beyond the appellate court's authority to promulgate. The court of appeals noted that under D.C. Code &sect; 11-721(a)(1) (2001), its jurisdiction was limited to review of final orders of the superior court. As an order to compel arbitration was not a final appealable order because it did not dispose of the entire case on the merits, and as the superior court stayed the underlying lawsuit rather than dismissing it with prejudice, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. D.C. Code &sect; 16-4427(a), an amendment to the District of Columbia Uniform Arbitration Act, D.C. Code &sect; 16-4401 et seq. (2009), which purported to make orders compelling arbitration appealable, exceeded the District of Columbia Council's authority because it violated &sect; 1-206.02 (a)(4) of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) approved intervenor developers' proposal to expand a hotel. Petitioner condominium unit owners' association sought judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The documents intervenors provided the advisory neighborhood commission (ANC) did not indicate how close the hotel's new annex would come to the condominium. Without appreciating that fact, the ANC recommended that the application be granted. After the BZA granted intervenors setback variances and other zoning relief, the ANC, claiming it had been misled, withdrew its approval. The association claimed that by denying the ANC's  request for a rehearing, the BZA breached its obligation to give &quot;great weight&quot; to the ANC's concerns. The appellate court disagreed. D.C. Code &sect; 1-309.10(d)(3)(A) (2006) contemplated that the ANC's position would be considered as part of the BZA's deliberative process, not after that process was completed. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 3113.13(b) (2000), which allowed notice of the hearing to be mailed to the association instead of each unit owner where the condominium had 25 or more units, did not deprive the owners of due process or equal protection. Notice to the association was sufficient as its officers, the owners' fiduciaries, were obliged to inform them of the hearing, and the classification was rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition for review and affirmed the BZA's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia convicted defendant of one count of attempted possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 7-2502.01(a) and 22-1803 (2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, for the first time on appeal, that application of the pre-Heller firearms law was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court concluded that defendant failed to show that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to him, because defendant failed to show that he lawfully could have registered a firearm. The government conceded that defendant was 25 years old and had no prior convictions. But the record on appeal did not establish that defendant could have met the other requirements for registering a firearm, such as those pertaining to mental health history, prior adjudication for firearm negligence, and vision. The appellate court further concluded that a remand was not appropriate, because defendant did not preserve the Second Amendment issue for appeal. Defendant also argued that a statement he made to a deputy marshal should have been suppressed, because the marshals had no right to detain him while conducing an eviction. The appellate court found no error, noting that although defendant was detained in his underwear on a sofa in his home, the officers's weapons were holstered and he was not handcuffed or restrained and thus, not in custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the trial court committed reversible error by (1) admitting hearsay statements during the testimony of two government witnesses; (2) permitting improper prosecutorial comments during the government's rebuttal argument; and (3) convicting him of conduct protected under the Second Amendment to the Constitution. Regarding one witness, the instant court found that although the evidence established only a reasonable probability, and not a certainty, that appellant possessed the murder weapon, the connection between the witness's comment and the murder was not conjectural and remote, and so the lack of certainty went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Next, the instant court found that the prosecutor's comments relating to facts not in evidence did not rise to the level of substantial prejudice to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trade associations sued appellee District of Columbia, challenging the validity of D.C.

The Superior Court of the District of Columbia entered summary judgment in favor of the District. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' members included non-District-based charter bus operators whose buses brought passengers into the District and thus were subject to the requirements of &sect; 50-1501.02(j). Appellants argued that &sect; 50-1501.02(j)'s registration scheme discriminated against and unduly burdened interstate commerce and therefore violated the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The appellate court disagreed. Section 50-1501.02(j) did not on its face, or because of its intent or its practical effect, discriminate against or burden interstate commerce. Its focus was the impact on the infrastructure and environment of buses that used the District's roadways, not on the buses' crossing jurisdictional lines into the city, and there was no evidence that the fees it imposed, which were not excessive, deterred interstate activities. There was no conflict between &sect; 50-1501.02(j) and the International Registration Plan (IRP), as the IRP did not, as appellants claimed, prohibit an IRP member jurisdiction like the District from requiring vehicles that were not &quot;apportionable&quot; from choosing between apportioned registration and some other forms of registration and fee payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants proposed an initiative to repeal the District of Columbia Jury and Marriage Amendment Act of 2009 (JAMA), D.C. Code &sect; 46-405.01 (2009 Supp.) and which provided that only heterosexual marriage was valid. Appellee District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics rejected the measure. Appellants sought a writ of mandamus. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted the Board summary judgment. Appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">JAMA provided that the District would recognize valid same-sex marriages entered into in other jurisdictions. The Board rejected the initiative on the ground that it would authorize or have the effect of authorizing discrimination barred by the D.C. Human Rights Act (HRA). The appellate court held that the HRA safeguard set out in D.C. Code &sect; 1-1001.16(b)(1)(C) (2006) was not inconsistent with the District of Columbia Council's intent as conveyed by the language of the D.C. Charter Amendments Act (CAA), D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 1-204.101 - 1-204.115. Substantial deference was owed to the Council's interpretation that the HRA safeguard carried out the intent of the CAA. The Council could not have intended to authorize, as a proper subject of initiative, any initiative that would have the effect of authorizing discrimination prohibited by the HRA. The D.C. Home Rule Act, Pub. L. No. 93-198, 87 Stat. 777, gave the Council the authority to direct the Board, through legislation implementing the CAA, to refuse to accept an initiative that would authorize prohibited discrimination. The Board correctly determined that the proposed initiative would have the effect of authorizing such discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens filed a pro se amended complaint alleging that appellee District of Columbia (District) violated their U.S. Const. amend. I, constitutional rights by selectively removing posters announcing a rally to protest the District's failure to bury utility lines as proposed in a Department of Transportation study. The citizens appealed the Superior Court of the District of Columbia's grant of summary judgment in favor of the District.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen's posters were removed by a District employee allegedly because they violated D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 24 &sect;&sect; 108.7, 108.10, and 108.11. However, the citizens' complaint alleged that the District's removal of the posters was selective and based solely on the content of the posters and that commercial posters that did meet statutory requirements were not removed. The trial court improperly interpreted the citizens' First Amendment selective enforcement claim as an equal protection claim, rather than as a First Amendment contention that, as applied to them, &sect; 108 was unconstitutional. The trial court erred in not advising the citizens of the pleading requirements for a summary judgment motion and in not affording sufficient time for discovery to properly defend the motion. The trial court also erred in considering the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine before considering the citizens' as applied issue, which was sufficiently raised in the citizens' filings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the District and remanded the action with instructions to afford the parties an opportunity to conduct discovery followed by further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sixteen-year-old juvenile was arrested for loudly yelling in protest and calling for his mother, on the street in a residential neighborhood in the middle of the night, after a police officer confiscated his money without permission or right. The trial court adjudicated him a juvenile delinquent for disorderly conduct and for possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute. On appeal, the court reversed. Under D.C. Code &sect; 22-1321 (2001), the juvenile's loud words, though they may have annoyed or disturbed nearby residents, did not threaten a breach of the peace or manifest an intent on his part to provoke one. The police therefore lacked probable cause to arrest him for disorderly conduct, and the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress the drugs discovered on his person in a search incident to his arrest. Because the evidence at trial did not suffice to prove disorderly conduct, the trial court should have acquitted him of that charge.</SPAN></P>

Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA), D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Days prior to her foreclosure, the foreclosure specialists sought out the homeowner and persuaded her to enter into an agreement whereby she was still liable for the mortgage payments but became a tenant of her house. When they evicted her, she filed an action against them, and the jury found that they were all liable for common law fraud and for violating the CPPA. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because the punitive damages were not grossly excessive or violative of due process; the punitive awards did not reflect the jury's attempt to punish them for their previous transactions with non-parties in other foreclosures. The award of treble and punitive damages was proper because their actions were particularly malicious; the homeowner was tricked into selling the home that she owned for over twenty-two years in exchange for a mere $ 5,000, even though expert trial testimony established that the fair market value of the house was $ 300,000 at the time of the transaction The court remanded the case to the trial court to apply a setoff to the treble award in the amount of a settlement the homeowner had reached with another party.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22-4504(a) (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the shooting of the victim, his girlfriend, was accidental. In support of his claim, he offered a handwritten note found in the victim's bedroom. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the note from evidence because there was no indication of when the note was written. However, whether or not the trial court erred in excluding the note, any error in its exclusion was harmless. The government's case was strong and undermined defendant's account of what occurred when the victim was shot. Even if the jury had seen the note, it was questionable whether they would have been willing to draw the inference that the victim confronted defendant with a loaded gun when he attempted to leave. The note was not evidence that in substantial measure would have corroborated defendant's account. Next, defendant sought reversal of his CPWL convictions on U.S. Const. amend. II grounds. Plain error review was applied because defendant did not raise the claim in the trial court. The CPWL statute,&nbsp;&sect; 22-4504(a), was constitutional both on its face and as applied to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for a traffic violation. After he was removed from his car and handcuffed, the arresting officers conducted a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of his vehicle. Before defendant's trial, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Arizona v Grant, 129 S. Ct. 1710 (2009), which precluded warrantless searches of an automobile after the occupants had been removed and secured with handcuffs, and thus no longer remained a threat to police safety or to preservation of evidence. Grant's revised interpretation of the Fourth Amendment applied retroactively. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply. Prior to Grant, the law was not settled regarding warrantless searches incident to a lawful arrest where the occupants had been removed and secured. Even if prior case law may have been widely understood to allow warrantless searches of vehicle passenger compartments without limitation incident to an arrest, momentum against such a sweeping interpretation on facts such as those in the instant case had been accelerating in the courts for years before defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

The evidence also showed that defendant took several deliberate actions to aid his confederates who did possess firearms.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a hearing examiner for the DMV. He was terminated after he consistently dismissed tickets generated by the Automated Traffic Enforcement system. The employee appealed to the Office of Employee Appeals (OEA), which sustained the termination. The employee filed suit in the superior court, which bifurcated the case and affirmed the OEA decision. The employee appealed that decision, but his appeal was dismissed. The employee then filed a second amended complaint, which alleged that he was &quot;wrongfully terminated.&quot; The trial court held that the ATE statute was constitutional and that the employee lacked standing to challenge it, and dismissed the case. The appellate court found that, once he abandoned judicial review of the OEA decision, the employee was precluded from filing a separate action challenging his termination. The complaint was properly dismissed. Under the Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act, D.C. Code &sect; 1-601.01 et seq. (2001), common law wrongful termination claims were preempted and the sole recourse to challenge a termination was by appeal to the OEA.

It addressed and materially advanced the District's substantial interest in the protection of consumers from unsolicited and often distressing intrusions upon their privacy, effected to secure their business in the aftermath of an automobile accident. The Act was narrowly drawn as it targeted the problems described in the legislative record--intrusive personal solicitation by practitioners, or their agents or runners, in the immediate aftermath of an accident. The Act constituted a reasonable means to achieve the legitimate objectives of the council. The Act was not aimed at the content of a practitioner's speech, but at the offensive behavior that often accompanied its delivery. The Act was not designed to suppress a viewpoint that the attorney espoused. The Act was an exercise of the council's police power to enact legislation for the protection of residents of the District of Columbia from intrusive and exploitative practices.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Superior Court of the District of Columbia denied defendant's motions to suppress and to dismiss the indictment on U.S. Const. II grounds, he was convicted of carrying a pistol without a license (former D.C. Code &sect; 22-4504) and possession of an unregistered firearm (former D.C. Code &sect; 7-502.01). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 911 caller reported a man carrying a handgun. Guns drawn, police approached defendant, who matched the description given by the caller, and told him to turn around and put his hands up. He seemed to try to pull something out of his pants; after the officers repeated the order several times, he put his hands up. Officers frisked him, found a gun, and arrested him. The appellate court held that as defendant failed to comply with orders to put his hands up, he did not submit to authority and thus was not &quot;seized&quot; at that time; and as police had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop defendant, his motion to suppress was properly denied. Defendant had standing to raise the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. II, as a defense by moving to dismiss the indictment, even though he had not tried to obtain a registration certificate and license for his handgun before his arrest. Former &sect;&sect; 7-2502.01(a) and 22-4504(a) were not facially invalid under the Second Amendment. However, because the trial court resolved the Second Amendment issue under pre-Heller law, it did not reach the issue of whether defendant would have been disqualified from registering under D.C. Code &sect; 7-2502.03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to hold a hearing to determine whether defendant would have satisfied the statutory requirements in &sect; 7-2502.03.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which denied his motion to suppress and convicted him of carrying a pistol without a license (CPWL), and the offense of possession of an unregistered firearm (UF), in violation of D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for CPWL and UF, asserting that the policy seized him under U.S. Const. amend. IV when they drew their weapons and ordered him to turn around and put his hands up. The appellate court concluded that he was not seized when the police approached him with their guns drawn and ordered him to put up his hands because he did not comply with that show of authority. Furthermore, at the time he was seized after complying with the order to put up his hands, the police had suitable corroboration showing reliability that he was the person identified in an anonymous 911 call as carrying a gun, and that because of his repeated movements to his waist where guns were commonly concealed, the police had suitable corroboration demonstrating reliability that he was engaged in the criminal act of carrying a gun. Consequently, the police had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop him, and the trial court  properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for perjury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on two counts of perjury for statements he made under oath before a grand jury investigating a murder. The target of the investigation was suspected of having ordered the murder. Defendant made three negative responses during his grand jury testimony to questions posed by the prosecutor. Under oath, he testified (1) that he had not spoken with anyone other than his girlfriend about the shooting; (2) that he had not told anyone he had information regarding who killed the victim; and (3) that no one ever had spoken to him about the suspect. The appellate court held the first two statements were contradicted by testimony that defendant told the witness that the suspect had arranged for the victim to be murdered. However, that testimony was not corroborated by any independent evidence. The third statement was not contradicted by any testimony as neither witness was asked whether he or she had spoken to defendant about the suspect, and neither claimed to have done so. If either witness in fact had said anything to defendant about the suspect, it was incumbent on the government to elicit that fact in order to prove that defendant lied when he denied it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of possession of an unregistered firearm under D.C. Code &sect; 7-2502.01, unlawful possession of ammunition under D.C. Code &sect; 7-2506.01, assault, and two counts of threatening to injure a person in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-1810 (2001). Defendant appealed his convictions, except the assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that defendant uttered one threat to his former girlfriend's mother when he told her he would blow her head off, and that he uttered a new threat when he directed his attention to his former girlfriend, striking her and uttering a second threat, directed to both victims collectively. Since the threats took place sequentially, the convictions did not merge under the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V. Evidence of the TP's prior convictions for drug trafficking while armed and possession of a pistol did not indicate that someone else committed the charged offenses. The prior convictions were not Winfield or reverse-Drew evidence. However, the prior convictions were relevant. The prior convictions had a tendency to prove that defendant did not know about the gun in his current girlfriend's closet, or have ready access to it. The error was harmless as defendant's threat to the mother was strong evidence that he had access to a gun. Further, the TP's pistol had been recovered, and the trial court was justified in trying to prevent jury confusion by keeping out evidence of limited probative value. Ownership of the gun was not dispositive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 24(c), the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, over defendant's objection, removed an empaneled juror and replaced him with an alternate. Defendant was convicted of one count of possessing a controlled substance with the intent to distribute in a drug-free zone. He appealed; a three-judge panel of the appellate court affirmed. Defendant's request for en banc review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions Juror 8 submitted to be put to the witnesses revealed his skepticism about the State's evidence. The trial court, finding that his questions indicated that he would have difficulty deliberating, replaced him with an alternate. The panel held that while the trial court violated the standards of Rule 24(c), the error was harmless because defendant did not show that as a result of Juror 8's removal, an impaneled juror failed to conscientiously apply the law and find the facts. The appellate court held that defendant had standing to object to the removal of the juror in contravention of Rule 24(c), as this implicated his right to trial by an impartial jury. A showing that defendant had a biased jury was not a prerequisite to a finding that the trial court violated Rule 24(c); (Nathaniel) Thomas v. United States, 824 A.2d 26 (D.C. 2003), which held otherwise, was overruled. The record was inadequate to justify the trial court's implicit finding that Juror 8 was &quot;unable&quot; to perform his juror duties; his questions had a reasonable basis in the evidence and were not objectionable. The error was not harmless, as Juror 8 might well have hung the jury by voting to acquit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the District of Columbia convicted defendant of first-degree murder while armed under D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to suppress a videotaped statement he made to police, because it was obtained following an unreasonable delay in presentment, in violation of D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 5(a). The appellate court found no error, noting that defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights also waived his right to presentment without unnecessary delay. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support is CPWL conviction, as the evidence was insufficient to show he carried or was armed with a pistol where no evidence was presented about the length of the barrel of the gun. The court found that rational jurors could not have failed to find that the barrel of the gun was less than 12 inches, noting, inter alia, defendant's reference to the firearm as a pistol and his testimony that he and the victim each carried their gun in their waistband. The appellate court also rejected defendant's claim that the CPWL statute was invalid, on its face and as applied, noting, inter alia, that prohibiting an adjudicated delinquent still under sentence from obtaining a license to carry a pistol served an important governmental objective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants engaged in protests against the Iraq war at buildings that were on or near the grounds of the Unites States Capitol.

Regarding convictions as to a demonstration at one building, defendants on appeal did not challenge them regarding unlawful assembly and the appellate court thus conclude any such challenge was waived. As to the remaining convictions, the appellate court found that the Government did not have to prove an actual or imminent breach of the peace so long as their intent to impede entry was shown, which it concluded was shown. It further found that defendants did not show that their First Amendment rights were violated regarding the convictions for unlawfully crossing police lines, as police pursuant to D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, because the traffic checkpoint was an unconstitutional roadblock. The appellate court concluded that the checkpoint was not an impermissible roadblock and that the issue was whether the officers had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe defendant was violating a motor vehicle law and whether he was seized while approaching the checkpoint before such suspicion materialized. The appellate court held that defendant was lawfully arrested for driving without a license and that his van and his person were lawfully searched incident to that arrest. Defendant was not seized when he was slowly merging into one lane to pass through the checkpoint. The checkpoint was not a roadblock, as the police stopped only those cars presenting noticeable traffic violations, such as defendant's lack of a rear-view mirror. Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, as there was no evidence he intended to possess the loaded gun. The appellate court disagreed, as the jury could have inferred possession from the fact that the gun was just below where defendant sat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal arising out of a murder and various assaults, five defendants challenged their convictions in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Among other crimes, four defendants were convicted of conspiracy to assault and to commit murder, in violation of D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-105(a), -2401, -3202 (1996 Supp.), and first-degree premeditated murder while armed, in violation of D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-2401, -3202 (1996 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals found that although the prosecutor's use of subpoenas and payment of fees intended for grand jury witnesses was improper, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting defendants' new trial motions (D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 33) because the abuse did not lead to subornation of perjured testimony that was presented at trial by the prosecutor. In participating in an assault on a victim with the knowledge that one of his cohorts carried a knife, a defendant acted with a wanton and willful disregard of an unreasonable risk to human life. Therefore, he had the requisite intent for second-degree murder. The evidence from which the jury could have inferred another defendant had the specific intent to kill a victim and did so with premeditation or deliberation was circumstantial and its source was impeached. The case against another defendant for assault was based on an eyewitness's testimony that he saw defendant knock a homeless man to the ground, and neither of three other uncalled witnesses had anything to say in this regard. The trial court did not err in denying, without a hearing, his motion for a new trial based on ineffectiveness of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first-degree murder while armed convictions of three defendants were reversed and their cases remanded with instructions to enter, instead, convictions for murder in the second degree while armed and resentence them. On remand, the trial court could consider whether another defendant's conviction of first-degree murder while armed should stand, and appoint new counsel if appropriate. In all other respects, the convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her conviction in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of assaulting, resisting, or interfering with a police officer (APO), in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-405(b) (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge found defendant guilty based solely on evidence that she failed to take her hands out of her pockets despite a lawful order to do so. The appeals court found that the trial court based its finding of guilt on an erroneous interpretation of the statute. Defendant did not actively or physically oppose or interfere with the officers simply by failing to remove her hands from her pockets. In light of the holdings in C.L.D., E.D.P., and Dolson, this aspect of defendant's conduct did not cross the line into active confrontation, obstruction, or other action directed against an officer's performance in the line of duty. In contrast, the evidence that defendant resisted officers' attempts to arrest her by swinging her arms and elbows and striking them, if credited by the finder of fact, would be amply sufficient to sustain a conviction under the APO statute, but the testimony from an officer and defendant was conflicting, and the trial court did not make any credibility determinations or factual findings to resolve those conflicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Superior Court was vacated, and the case was remanded so that the trial court could determine whether to convict based on a more comprehensive view of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of assault with a dangerous weapon (D.C. Code &sect; 22-402 (2001)), threatening to injure a person (D.C. Code &sect; 22-1810 (2001)), carrying a pistol without a license (D.C. Code &sect; 22-4504(a) (2001)), possessing an unregistered firearm (D.C. Code &sect; 7-2502.01 (2001)), possessing ammunition (D.C. Code &sect; 7-2506.01(3) (2001)), and drug offenses. He appealed his weapons convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his weapons convictions violated the Second Amendment. The appellate court held the Second Amendment barred absolute bans on handguns held for self-defense in the home, where he had the gun in question, but nothing showed he had it for self-defense. The statutes he was convicted under were not facially unconstitutional or invalidated by a finding that, collectively, the District of Columbia's gun-control laws violated the Second Amendment. He did not show his convictions were plain error, as he used a gun to threaten another instead of for a lawful purpose. Sufficient evidence showed he carried a pistol without a license because no proof of carrying it outside his home was required, it was &quot;convenient of access&quot; to him when found, and he used it two days earlier. Not moving to sever drug-related charges from the assault and threats charges was not ineffective because the motion would have been denied as the charges arose from sufficiently related transactions, under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 8(a), and no prejudice requiring severance was shown as the crimes were not similar, the evidence as to each was distinct, and the jury was told to consider them separately.</SPAN></P>

A police officer saw defendant throw a pistol into the rear yard of a dwelling, which was not defendant's residence. On appeal, the court affirmed. While defendant claimed that U.S. Const. amend. II barred his prosecution for the weapons offenses as the CPWL, UF, and UA statutes were constitutionally invalid on their face in light of District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008), the claim was not preserved as it was not raised in the trial court. The court noted that the U.S. Const. amend. II challenge was not jurisdictional and thus could be waived. Applying plain error review to defendant's claim, the argument failed at the threshold as Heller dealt with possession of a firearm in one's residence. Additionally, the evidence did not link defendant's possession of the gun to any arguable motive of self defense that would cause him to remove the gun from his home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia convicted defendants of armed robbery of a senior citizen and of weapons charges. Defendants challenged the denial of a D.C. Code &sect; 11-1910 motion for discovery of jury-selection records and requests for other jury information, claiming violations of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the District of Columbia Jury System Act (DCJSA), D.C. Code &sect; 11-1901 et seq. (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented was whether the trial judge correctly denied the &sect; 11-1910 motion and request for discovery for failure to present a prima facie case of a violation of the Constitution or of the DCJSA in the motion. Defendant claimed that the jury panels were disproportionately Caucasian because professionals, who tended to be Caucasian, asked to be deferred, and were given Mondays to come back to court. The court reviewed the comparable federal statute,&nbsp;28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1867(f), and found that the DCJSA omitted language that created the unqualified right to inspect jury records prior to the filing of a motion that alleged constitutional or statutory deficiencies in the juror selection process. A criminal defendant in the District did not have the same unqualified right as his federal counterpart. In the District of Columbia, if there was in fact reason to believe that constitutional or statutory violations occurred, it was not unduly difficult for a competent attorney to satisfy the relatively modest standard that access to the records was available to a defendant only if there was reason to believe that there had been a constitutional or statutory violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision on the jury motion and remanded the case for a determination of whether defendants demonstrated a reason to believe that the jury selection violated the Constitution or the DCJSA. If such reason to believe existed, then the trial court was to grant discovery, set a hearing, and rule on the motion's merits. If there was no reason to believe that a violation occurred, the request for discovery was to be denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant on the front plaza of the Supreme Court; when the officer approached defendant to tell him he was not permitted to demonstrate on the grounds, defendant lifted an object over his head and fired some sort of projectile.

Defendant claimed that shooting a flare gun was not within any of the categories of activities that &sect; 6134 made unlawful and that &sect; 6134 was unconstitutionally vague.

Although &quot;firework&quot; was not defined in &sect; 6134, the trial court properly used the dictionary definition to determine that the flare gun was covered under the statute; defendant acknowledged that the flare gun was a signaling device, and a firearms instructor testified that the projectile from a flare gun caused a flame when it was ejected. Because defendant failed to make his constitutional argument below, the plain error standard was applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a committee, filed a petition to review the order of respondent, the District of Columbia Zoning Commission, which approved a modification to the Planned Unit Development (PUD) of intervenor developer. The controversy was sparked by the applicant's plan to convert a hotel into a cooperatively-owned apartment building. The committed filed several objections to the Commission's findings and challenged certain of its procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was a historic hotel, which the developer sought to modify to covert it into 133 cooperative apartments. The application also proposed increasing the parking available, making minor changes to the exterior of the building and roof area, and modifying, but not eliminating, the health club and restaurant facilities. The committee asserted various procedural and substantive challenges to the Commission's approval of the modified PUD. The court addressed each challenge and found no merit to any of the contentions. The court disagreed with the committee's contention that the Commission adopted the applicant's findings virtually verbatim. The court found that the Commission added sentences and phrases, changed sentence structure, referenced the applicable regulations, changed the grammar, and, in some places, added entirely new paragraphs. The court found that the approved modifications did not interfere with any vested interest as there was no vested right in zoning classifications for anyone to assert. Ultimately, the court found that the Commission's order was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The government argued that the case was to be remanded with instructions to the trial court to vacate the conviction of possession and enter a conviction for the lesser-included offense of attempted possession of marijuana. Defendant countered that he was entitled to reversal and a new trial because the admission of the report was not harmless error even as to the lesser-included offense. On appeal, the court found that the erroneous admission of the report without an opportunity for defendant to cross-examine the chemist who prepared it was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the offense of attempted possession of marijuana because it could not be said that the error did not contribute to the verdict, and the government did not otherwise present overwhelming evidence that defendant intended to possess marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Historic Preservation Review Board (HPRB) held that the issuance of construction permits to petitioner property owner was inconsistent with a former embassy's designation as a historical landmark under the Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act, D.C. Code &sect; 6-1101 et seq. (2001), respondent Mayor's Agent for Historic Preservation affirmed the HPRB's decision. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building was designated a landmark after the owner had applied for permits. The court first held that the HPRB and the Mayor's Agent had jurisdiction to review the permits under the Historical Preservation Act. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 10A, &sect; 209.5 contemplated that historical landmark applications might be filed after permit applications were filed. Next, the Mayor's Agent properly held that the owner had not shown that its project had &quot;special merit&quot; under D.C. Code &sect; 6-1102(11), as there was evidence that the project was not of the exceptional quality as the original landmark. Futhermore, there was substantial evidence that the project would not bring a significant social benefit. Finally, denial of the permits did not result in an unreasonable economic hardship under &sect; 6-1102(14), which incorporated the Fifth Amendment's protection against the taking of property without just compensation. The property could be used in its original form, or the owner could propose a different design. The owner's investment-backed expectations were not reasonable, as it had taken a calculated risk in the face of concerns that the property might be designated as a historic landmark.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, various individuals and the District of Columbia, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which dismissed their cause of action alleging negligence, creation of a public nuisance, and liability under the District of Columbia's Assault Weapons Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, D.C. Code &sect; 7-2551.01 et seq., against defendants, firearm manufacturers, importers, and distributors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit was dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7901 et seq., which required dismissal of pending claims against defendants when the claimed harm alleged was solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products by others when the product functioned as designed and intended. The court upheld the dismissal of plaintiffs' cause of action because plaintiffs did not allege liability on the theory that defendants knowingly violated any proscriptions or requirements of local or federal law governing the sale or possession of firearms. Instead, plaintiffs argument was that the SLA, which by its terms would make defendants strictly liable in tort for death or injuries resulting from the discharge of an assault weapon or machine gun manufactured or sold, embodied a legal duty owed to the residents of the District and that its requirement to compensate for injuries thus presupposed a violation of a statutory duty. The court refused to allow an impermissible interpretation of the PLCAA that was not intended. Additionally, the court found no merit to plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the PLCAA.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that his convictions should be vacated because D.C. Code &sect;&nbsp;22-1312 (2001) was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed, finding such an argument refuted by a longstanding line of cases. The appellate court also noted that a consent defense was barred by the statute because the victim was under the age of 16 when the events took place. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction involving the father because there was no evidence he intended to expose himself to the father or that he actually exposed his genitalia to the father. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the specific intent to expose oneself to a particular person was not required, there was no question defendant intended to expose himself, and the father's testimony that defendant was facing him &quot;completely naked&quot; supported a finding that the father saw defendant's genitalia.</SPAN></P>

Although appellant argued that had he received a &quot;guideline sentence&quot; under the current sentencing guidelines, he would have received a considerably lesser sentence, the voluntary sentencing guidelines had not been in effect when appellant was sentenced. Furthermore, as the guidelines were voluntary, they would not have compelled a lesser sentence. Accordingly, given the limited standard of review, the court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion. As for appellant's Eighth Amendment argument, he had not raised that argument on direct appeal and had not shown cause for his failure to do so. Furthermore, even if appellant's claim were considered on the merits, his sentence was not so grossly disproportionate to the crime as to violate the Eighth Amendment. It was well within the statutory maximum, and there were a number of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2-1401.01 et seq. (2001 &amp; 2006 Supp.); breach of the club's by-laws; failure to provide due process; breach of contract; and tortious acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club's board members concluded that the club member had used the club's facilities to conduct business with persons who publicly expounded racist and anti-Semitic views. They then expelled him from membership in the club. During the investigation, the board members gave the club member written notice of the charges and gave him a copy of an investigative report, which included a summary of interviews that were conducted and served as the basis for the charges against him. The board members also heard from the club member and his counsel. The club member alleged that the expulsion violated the District of Columbia Human Rights Act of 1977, which, among other things, prohibited discrimination based on source of income, under D.C. Code &sect; 2-1401.02(29) (2001 &amp; 2006 Supp.), and political affiliation, under D.C. Code &sect;2-1401.02(25) (2001 &amp; 2006 Supp.). On appeal, the court found that the club did not publicly discriminate against the club member in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 2-1402.31 (2001 &amp; 2006 Supp.) of the Human Rights Act by expelling him. Moreover, the procedures that were used complied with the by-laws governing expulsion and the process was fundamentally fair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court certified two class actions arising out of real estate tax assessments made against two groups of taxpayers. One group was made up of people owning certain residential properties. The second group was a &quot;class in formation.&quot; The two groups wanted to challenge tax assessments for a particular tax year because they believed the assessments were excessive. Following a hearing, the trial court granted declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of the taxpayers. The trial court also granted summary judgment to them upon finding that the assessment method led to widespread discrimination. It further ruled that the assessment method should have been subject to District of Columbia rule-making procedures. On appeal, the appellate court found that the relief that the trial court awarded violated the District of Columbia Anti-Injunction Act, D.C. Code &sect; 47-3307, because most of the lawsuits were not refund lawsuits, and exceptions that the District of Columbia would have no possibility of prevailing and that the taxpayers had no adequate legal remedy did not apply.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the National Capital Revitalization Corporation (NCRC), initiated condemnation proceedings in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, against appellant owner's property pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 2-1219.19 (2001). The trial court granted the NCRC's motion to strike the owner's defenses under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(f), and granted the NCRC's motion for immediate possession of the property. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The NCRC was an independent instrumentality of the District of Columbia charged with several public purposes under D.C. Code &sect; 2-1219.02(b) (2001). Pursuant to D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 71A(e), the owner as an affirmative defense asserted primarily that the taking of his property violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the taking was for a private use and that the declared public purpose for the condemnation was a pretext. On appeal, the court found that it was appropriate for the court to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction because the order granting immediate possession was properly before the court for review under D.C. Code &sect; 11-721(a)(2)(C) (2001), and it was inextricably intertwined with the court's decision to strike the owner's defenses. The court concluded that the owner sufficiently pleaded a defense of pretext under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 8. Moreover, the pretext defense raised an issue requiring proof. That defense therefore had to be resolved on its merits, and could not be stricken for insufficient pleading.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further consideration of the owner's pretext defense. The order granting the NCRC's motion for immediate possession was vacated, subject to a stay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sued appellee partner in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, for breach of a partnership agreement. After the trial court instructed the parties to select an auditor to conduct an accounting of partnership assets, the court ordered the attorney to make an additional deposit into the court registry pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 15-703(b) (2001). The attorney appealed. The partner filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were colleagues in a law firm. Given the attorney's nonresident status, the trial court required the attorney to post security for costs pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 15-703(a) (2001). After the jury found liability in favor of the attorney, the trial court ordered an accounting of partnership assets. However, a dispute arose between the parties regarding the costs of the accounting. As a result of this dispute, the trial court required the attorney to pay an additional amount into the court registry pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 15-703(b) (2001). On appeal, the court found that the collateral order doctrine did not apply to the type of order at issue, which was, in effect, a discretionary decision by the trial court as opposed to a disputed question of law. Therefore, the trial court's ruling was the type of discretionary ruling that did not warrant immediate review. Further, the question whether the trial court abused its discretion was an issue that could await a determination with respect to damages, at which point, the issue may have become moot. Finally, security orders pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 15-703(b) were not subject to interlocutory appeal as injunctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In New York State, the attorney pled guilty to insurance fraud, grand larceny, and workers' compensation fraud, stemming from his falsely reporting his level of professional functioning in order to obtain increased disability benefits from his private insurance coverage.

Next, the appellate court noted that because District of Columbia case law put the attorney on clear notice that conviction for crimes of moral turpitude per se would result in automatic disbarment, the attorney could not claim ignorance of the potential consequences of his conviction. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the attorney's convictions involved moral turpitude, as all required the element of intentional theft or a specific intent to defraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer argued that the Commission's finding of discrimination was not supported by substantial evidence or in accordance with applicable law. As the findings upon which the Commission relied were supported by substantial evidence in the record, the appeals court had to accept its decision that the reasons given by the employer for its action were a pretext, even though a different one might have been reached on the same record. There was a rational basis for the Commission to find that the employer's explanation was not worthy of credence. When considered with the employee's prima facie case and other evidence cited by the Commission supporting its finding of liability, the appeals court could not conclude that the Commission erred in finding the employer liable for unlawful discrimination. Under the totality of the circumstances, a finding that the employee's rejection of a position was objectively reasonable was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the employee's rejection of the employer's unconditional offer of the position of Regional Manager eliminated any claim for back-pay or front-pay on or after March 22, 1995, the date he rejected the employer's offer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the vehicle owner and the leasing corporation, sued appellee District of Columbia in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging that the Automated Traffic Enforcement System (ATE System) established by D.C. Code &sect; 50-2209.01 (2001) et seq. violated the Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process. The trial court granted summary judgment to the District. The owner and the corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ATE System, developed pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 50-2209.01, detected moving violations under the District's traffic laws through the use of photographs taken by automated cameras installed at various locations throughout the District. The owner and the corporation argued that the method of assessing liability preliminarily to the registered owner of a car conflicted with the statutory framework in D.C. Code &sect; 50-2302.06(a), which required that the District prove a moving violation by clear and convincing evidence, and that the presumption of liability on the registered owner of a car under D.C. Code &sect; 50-2209.02 violated their due process rights. They also argued that the compensation arrangement with a private corporation for administrative aspects of the ATE System under D.C. Code &sect; 50-2209.03 violated their due process rights by creating an adjudicatory tribunal that was tainted by financial considerations.

The chemist's written statement was offered in evidence, pursuant to D.C.

However, the court agreed that the Confrontation Clause barred the prosecution from introducing the report without calling the chemist to testify in person, unless the chemist was unavailable and appellant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the chemist, which neither of the two latter prerequisites were met. The court agreed that plain error occurred but that it did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding to merit reversal of appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions by a jury in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of first-degree murder, felony murder, kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, conspiracy, and related firearms offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his prosecution on the basis of a factual theory allegedly different from, and irreconcilable with, the factual theory relied on by the government to secure the conviction of defendant's former codefendant deprived defendant of his liberty without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and that the government violated its obligations pursuant to Brady by failing to provide him with material exculpatory statements by prospective witnesses. The appeals court found that although the prosecutor should have revealed to the jury in defendant's case that the government's factual theory had changed on a material issue from the position the government took at the codefendant's trial, defendant was not entitled to reversal on that ground, for the inconsistency in the government's theory did not go to the core of its case. Further, the potentially exculpatory statement of at least one prospective witness who had been interviewed by the police should have been provided to the defense, and the trial judge abused her discretion in declining to review, in camera, two other allegedly exculpatory statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. If the trial judge concluded, after the parties had an opportunity to be heard, that the withholding of the statements of five witnesses, individually or collectively, violated defendant's rights, the judge was to order a new trial. If the judge concluded the statements were not material, then the convictions would stand, subject to the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former tenant sued appellee landlord in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, for wrongful eviction, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and conversion of personal property. The trial court granted the landlord's motion to dismiss. The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a dispute arose about the tenant's alleged failure to pay rent to the landlord, the landlord filed a complaint for possession. The Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia entered a default judgment granting possession of the apartment to the landlord after the tenant failed to appear or defend. The tenant did not seek to vacate the judgment against him, nor did he appeal the judgment. Instead, more than a year later, he filed his civil complaint against the landlord. The tenant argued that he should not have been precluded from bringing his wrongful eviction action because the previous judgment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the court found that, having allowed the time for appeal to expire, the tenant could attack the default judgment, if he wanted to avoid its preclusive effect, only by filing a motion to vacate under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4), or by filing the type of independent action to vacate the judgment authorized by D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the doctrine of res judicata barred the tenant's complaint for wrongful eviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a jury trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of, among other crimes, conspiracy to assault and murder members of a rival neighborhood faction, D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-105a, -501, -2401 (1996) (recodified at D.C. Code &sect; 22-1805a, -401, -2101 (2000)) and first-degree murder while armed, D.C. Code &sect; 22-2401 (recodified at D.C. Code &sect; 22-2101). He filed a timely direct appeal, and a timely collateral appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals found that the trial court did not violate the Fifth Amendment by denying defendant's motion to suppress his confession, where his interrogation was in two phases, before and after Miranda warnings. A detective elicited none of the details from defendant in phase one that emerged in phase two, and it was clear that the Miranda warnings as administered would meaningfully apprise a reasonable suspect of the right or choice to remain silent, and thus were effective. The court did not err in refusing to hold a hearing on his D.C. Code &sect; 23-110 motion, as defendant presented no affidavit in support of his allegations, and the trial court found his assertions regarding trial counsel and defendant's statement to the police &quot;palpably false.&quot; Moreover, defendant raised some new allegations on appeal which had not been preserved, and hence, would not be considered on appeal. A rational trier of fact could have found the elements of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, as the evidence revealed that defendant and two others discussed and agreed to exact revenge against persons in another neighborhood block because of actions and words by two members of that faction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, defendant was convicted of attempted cruelty to animals, D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-1001, 22-1803 (2001) and of two counts of assault, D.C. Code &sect; 22-404 (2001). He had been charged under the Bias-Related Crimes Statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-3701, 22-3703 (2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When passing by some women walking their dogs, defendant hit two of the women, called them &quot;dykes,&quot; and yelled obscenities at them. He allegedly tried to kick one of the dogs. At trial, defendant admitted yelling anti-lesbian insults at the women but denied kicking the dog. The court first held that the evidence sustained the conviction of attempted cruelty to animals. The trial court had found no reason to doubt the credibility of the Government's witnesses, and it had doubted defendant's testimony that he was merely trying to push the small dog away. Next, defendant argued that the bias statute was unconstitutional. Reviewing the argument for plain error because it had not been raised before the trial court, the court stated that it was defendant's assaultive conduct motivated by bias, not his homophobia as such, that had been subjected to criminal sanction. There was no vagueness in the statute as it applied to defendant, given his evident animus against the women's sexual orientation. Moreover, application of the bias statute had not violated defendant's substantial rights because his sentence had not been enhanced beyond that available for simple assault.</SPAN></P>
