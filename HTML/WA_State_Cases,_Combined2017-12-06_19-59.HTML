</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court committed legal error by applying equitable tolling to the case, thereby allowing defendant to collaterally attack his conviction, as there was no evidence in defendant's declaration supporting his motion to vacate that evidenced bad faith, deception, or false assurances by the City or anyone else. The record was devoid of any evidence that would have supported equitable tolling of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.93.070 beyond its one-year limit. Moreover, the absence of a written acknowledgement that defendant was advised in accordance with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.40.200(2) did not support equitable tolling of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.93.090's one-year bar as the destruction of court files pursuant to a records retention policy did not prove that no acknowledgement ever existed, nor did an absence of the acknowledgement evidence bad faith, deception, or false assurances by anyone. Finally, the judgment of conviction was not invalid on its face as defendant failed to present the original judgment or a copy of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Superior Court of Pend Oreille County (Washington) of first degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon. The jury also found that the victim's injuries substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the crime, allowing an exceptional sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(y). Defendant was sentenced to 480 months. Defendant appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an argument, defendant stabbed the victim in the back of his neck with a knife, causing severe paralysis. The victim dropped a burner he was holding, starting a fire. Defendant ignored the victim's pleas for help and left, so the victim put the fire out with his bare arms while the knife was lodged in his neck. The victim's spinal cord was cut in two, causing paralysis below the waist, including his bladder and intestines, and partial paralysis above the waist and confining the victim to a wheelchair. A doctor predicted an increased risk of pneumonia, stroke, seizure, and death and gave the victim a 17-year shortened life expectancy. Defendant argued that the victim's injuries inhered in first degree assault and could not justify an exceptional sentence. The court disagreed, finding that these severe injuries and ongoing problems were sufficiently severe and did not inhere in the assault. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(y) was vague because the doctrine did not apply to sentencing schemes and because the statute apprised individuals that inflicting serious bodily injury upon another would subject them to a higher sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's exceptional sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a committed individual (appellant), sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which authorized his commitment as a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order authorizing his commitment under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(16) as an SVP pursuant to the Act. He argued, in part, that the trial court erred by allowing appellant's expert witness to be impeached through the use of findings of fact entered in an unrelated superior court matter. The appellate court agreed, reversing the judgment. Viewed in context, it was apparent that the State was seeking to introduce findings of fact on an unrelated case on the question of whether the expert witness had acted consistent with the standards of his profession in interviewing and evaluating appellant. That was a matter for expert testimony, not lay testimony. It was apparent that appellant's counsel's objection to the questioning, based on a lack of foundation, was premised upon the State's failure to qualify the prior judge in that unrelated matter as an expert witness in the areas of sex offender evaluation and psychology. That objection was properly made. The prior court's factual findings were not relevant and appellant's objection based on lack of foundation was also correctly interposed and should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband (husband) sought review of the decision of the trial court (Washington), which found in favor of respondent ex-wife (wife) and denied the husband's motion to modify or vacate a permanent restraining order in effect since the parties' dissolution of marriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to modify or vacate a permanent restraining order in effect since the dissolution of his marriage. He argued that the order's requirement that he stay 500 feet away from the wife too broadly infringed on his constitutional rights of freedom of travel and movement. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the record showed that the husband needed to travel a mere 0.2 miles further from his professed regular routes of travel to stay beyond 500 feet from the wife's home and business. Such minimal distances did not reasonably impose an unconstitutional burden on his freedom of travel. The husband was free to move about as he pleased and the restraining order only burdened his freedom of movement by occasionally requiring him to leave a public establishment in the area when the wife happened to be in the same location. Even assuming that his rights to movement and travel were actually implicated, the State was permitted to curtail those rights to protect the wife from any invasive, oppressive, and harmful behavior on the part of the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the wife was awarded fees and costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged a judgment of the Spokane County Superior Court (Washington) granting appellee city partial summary judgment, quieting title to the disputed property to the city, and entering an order and warrant of abatement compelling the landowner to demolish and remove all portions of his building constructed on the right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner operated an auto repair business from his property, which fronted a street; his building was located at the edge of the city's sidewalk. The city filed an action to quiet title to the 12-foot strip of property condemned by an ordinance in 1889 and to abate the public nuisance created by the encroachment of the building on the public right-of-way. On appeal of the trial court's judgment for the city, the court held that the city presented evidence that it had compensated the owners of the affected land lots by adopting Cheney, Wash., Ordinance No. 83, providing that the city vacated 12 feet of the alley at the rear of the lots. In addition, any challenge to the compensation provided in the ordinance should have been made within 20 days from the time of the award in 1889. The landowner failed to produce any deed in his chain of title conveying the disputed part of the property to him. The court rejected the landowner's equal protection claim because the record reflected nothing that could be construed to imply a deliberate discriminatory purpose on the part of the city. The court also rejected the landowner's equitable estoppel, laches, and waiver claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electrical contractor sued respondent state agency for negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, malicious prosecution, negligent supervision, and (under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983) violation of his civil rights. A Washington trial court summarily dismissed all claims and awarded the agency statutory damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.510. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit involved the contractor's arrest after a 911 call by agency employees who feared that the contractor would assault them. The court held that the agency was immune from civil liability under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.510 because (1) state agencies were &quot;persons&quot; under &sect; 4.24.510; (2) there was no evidence that the agency's communication to police was not in good faith; (3) &sect; 4.24.510 applied to the malicious prosecution claim; and (4) the negligent supervision claim was based upon, or was the result of, the agency's communications to the police. The agency was entitled to attorney fees and costs because it prevailed in its &sect; 4.24.510 defense and there was no evidence of bad faith. Summary judgment on the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress was proper because any such distress was not reasonably foreseeable. Summary dismissal of the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action was proper because the state was immune from suits under &sect; 1983 for acts of its agents. Finally, the contractor's amended &sect; 1983 claim against an agency employee was untimely because under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 15(c), the claim related back only to a date over three years after it accrued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, filed negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims against respondents, the Washington State Department of Licensing, its director, and employees of the Department. The trial court erred in dismissing their negligence claims under the public duty doctrine and granted summary judgment in favor of the Department. The husband and wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband wrote the Department, asking it to investigate a medical notation in his file. The Department found no documents supporting the medical certificate requirement and removed the notation the next day. The husband obtained his commercial driver's license a few days later. But, by that time, he was no longer enrolled in the school bus driver course. The husband alleged that the instructor told him to leave and not come back when he informed the instructor of the notation. The husband and his wife sued the Department. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.041 evidenced the legislature's intent to protect the public by ensuring that the Department did not issue licenses to persons who might not be able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The provision allowing a person to prove that despite a mental disability or disease, he or she was capable of driving safely, was simply part of the screening process and did not show a legislative intent to protect a particular class of citizens. Thus, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.041 did not express a clear intent to protect a particular and circumscribed class of persons. Therefore, the public duty doctrine barred the husband and wife's negligence claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Whatcom County Superior Court (Washington) ordered defendant juvenile involuntarily committed for 90 days of psychiatric treatment following a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Adhering to the dictate of Rule 1.3, the trial court ordered that the entirety of defendant's commitment proceeding be closed to the public. On appeal, the court first rejected the State's mootness argument; the trial court's order created sufficient adverse consequences such that mootness was not a bar to defendant's appeal. In analyzing Rule 1.3, the court noted that the supreme court had repeatedly articulated an exacting test that trial courts had to apply to determine whether court closure satisfied Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10's open justice requirements. A statute or rule was unconstitutional on its face if there were no circumstances where it could constitutionally be applied. Wash. Super. Ct. Mental Proc. R. 1.3 did not allow for any circumstances in which trial judges could perform the analysis required by the supreme court. Thus, Rule 1.3 was unconstitutional on its face. The remedy for holding a statute facially unconstitutional was to render the statute totally inoperative. Because the trial court failed to weigh the relevant competing interests in closing a court proceeding--whether the reason--the remedy was reversal and remand for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's commitment order and remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his judgment and sentence for two counts of attempted first-degree kidnapping and one count of first-degree burglary. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that a jury instruction clearly and accurately conveyed that the jury must unanimously agree that one act of assault was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jury must unanimously agree on which act had been proved. Further, the jury's acquittal on the attempted murder counts did not alter the fact that the record contained evidence sufficient to support a conviction based on all alternative means. Unanimity as to guilt, which defendant received, was all that was required. The prosecutor's comments fairly argued the evidence in the record and the credibility of defendant as a witness. Moreover, the prosecutor also reminded jurors to make decisions on the evidence and not on their feelings about the case or on their passions or predispositions. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.020 was not unconstitutionally vague because the phrase &quot;substantial step&quot; clearly advised the public that mere preparation to commit a crime was not a criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Franklin County (Washington) entered an order reversing the determination of appellant city's code enforcement board that respondent owner of a mobile home park violated a valid city ordinance by allowing placement of recreational vehicles in his residential mobile home park. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reading Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 59.20.040,.080 and.130 together, the legislature expressly conferred concurrent jurisdiction to local municipalities in the field of regulating landlord-tenant compliance with ordinances. Thus, the Manufactured/Mobile Home Landlord-Tenant Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 59.20, did not preempt Pasco, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 25.40.060. In addition, the Act did not require a landlord to rent a mobile home park lot for placement of a recreational vehicle (park model) in any (or every) particular place within the State. Also, the ordinance in no way attempted to restrict or contradict the provisions of the Act, which expressly deferred to municipal authority in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 59.20.130(1). Thus, the appellate court concluded that there was no irreconcilable conflict between the Act and the ordinance. Furthermore, the statute and the ordinance could each operate distinctly without inconsistency. Thus, the owner of the mobile home park failed to show that the ordinance was preempted by the Act and was therefore unconstitutional. Accordingly, the ordinance was a valid exercise of municipal police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's former wife obtained a no-contact order that prohibited defendant from having contact with her and coming within 500 feet of her residence, school, or workplace. Defendant was later convicted of tampering with a witness and violating the no-contact order. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for tampering with a witness. Defendant told a social worker on several occasions that he intended to get his former wife to take back her story regarding his abuse of one of their children. Defendant's subsequent behavior involved reporting unfounded complaints against the former wife for abusing animals and children. Defendant placed a van with derogatory remarks about the former wife in her neighborhood for all to see. However, the State conceded that insufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for violation of the no-contact order. There was no testimony in the record that the wife was present when defendant came within 500 feet of her residence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Washington Department of Licensing (DOL), appealed from an order of the Superior Court, King County (Washington), that vacated a DOL order suspending the driving privileges of respondent driver. The superior court's order was premised on its conclusion that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied in the DOL hearing and precluded the DOL from offering evidence in that proceeding of the driver's breath alcohol content.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal court entered an order suppressing the blood alcohol content (BAC) test results in the criminal action, but the hearing officer for the DOL admitted the BAC evidence, refusing to apply collateral estoppel. At the administrative hearing, it was incumbent upon the driver to establish not merely that the BAC test results had been excluded in the municipal court proceeding, but also to prove by competent evidence that the issue presented in the license suspension proceeding was identical in all respects to the issue decided in the criminal proceeding, including the applicable legal rules. No transcript of the municipal court proceeding was provided to the appellate court. The municipal court order itself provided no delineation of the basis for its determination. Thus, because the driver failed to present any competent evidence in the DOL hearing tending to prove the precise issues that were decided in the prior municipal court action and the precise legal bases for the municipal court's ruling, collateral estoppel could not properly be applied as to any of the issues presented in the subsequent administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

The father made no attempt or was unwilling to participate in services once he was released from prison. The father admitted at trial that he was physically violent during his relationship with the mother, but he did not go to the court ordered anger management classes because he had previously attended such a class and did not think he was in need of that service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The King County Superior Court (Washington) sentenced petitioner inmate under the Washington Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative (DOSA). After the inmate violated the community custody conditions of his DOSA sentence, he was reincarcerated. The Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) then recalculated his sentence. The inmate filed a personal restraint petition challenging the DOC's calculation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was not entitled to receive credit for the periods of time when he was either absent from supervision or was incarcerated on unrelated charges. But, under the DOSA statute, former Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.94A.660, the appellate court found that the inmate was entitled to credit for the time spent in confinement for violating the community custody conditions of that sentence. The appellate court also determined that, absent evidence to the contrary, the presumption would be that tolling of his community custody under former Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.94A.625 began on the date the inmate failed to report to his community corrections officer (CCO), not the date of the inmate's last contact with his CCO. Finally, if the DOC terminated the inmate from the DOSA program and revoked the DOSA sentence, the alternative DOSA sentence became a sentence like any other and the inmate was then subject to all rules relating to earned release time in the same way as other inmates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that they must unanimously agree about which act constituted the drug paraphernalia charge. The appellate court found that the unanimity rule did not apply because the case involved a continuing course of conduct. There was no basis for the jury to find unwitting possession as to some items and not others. Had defense counsel requested the unanimity instruction, the jury's verdict would have been the same. The prohibition against the possession and consumption of controlled substances under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.700(4)(c) was too broad. The alcohol prohibition was too broad and had to be modified to preclude only the consumption of alcohol. The prohibition of possession of deadly weapons was not related to defendant's crime. There was no claim that defendant had been charged with violating the condition requiring law abiding behavior. Defendant's claim that the State violated her right to a speedy trial was without merit. The charge itself referred to the correct statute and included all of the elements of the crime. Defendant's argument about trial counsel could not be reviewed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mine operator sued respondent county, seeking a declaratory judgment that the county's clean water charge (CWC) was an invalid property tax and not a regulatory fee imposed under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Washington courts applied three factors to decide whether a charge was a regulatory fee or a tax: (1) whether the primary purpose was to raise revenue (tax) or to regulate (regulatory fee); (2) whether the money collected had to be allocated only to the authorized regulatory purpose; and (3) whether there was a direct relationship between the fee charged and: (a) the service received by those who paid the fee, or (b) the burden produced by the fee payer. Applying these factors, the court noted that: (1) the CWC was limited to purposes such as paying the cost and expense of regulating, monitoring and evaluating storm water impacts and maintaining and operating storm water control facilities; (2) the county deposited CWC service charges, interest, and penalties for delinquent payments and earnings thereon in a special fund that could be used only for the CWC's purposes; (3) the CWC provided a service to its payers by providing storm water facilities to accommodate their storm water runoff; and (4) the CWC alleviated the burdens that its payers created by working to clean up water pollution and to offset the detrimental impacts of storm water running off impervious surfaces.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the absence of first degree assault was not an essential element of second degree assault and because the State did not charge defendant with first degree assault, the information language charging defendant with only second degree assault was sufficient. Because the absence of first degree assault was not an element of second degree assault and the State did not charge defendant with first degree assault, the jury to-convict instruction for second degree assault was not deficient. The legislative and judicial branches of the state government did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in using common law to define &quot;assault.&quot; Defendant failed to show that the trial court's knowledge instruction was error. The evidence supported the mental-state element of defendant's first degree kidnapping conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded that one prior conviction was issued under the statutes enumerated in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.110(5), but argued that there was insufficient evidence of a second predicate offense. One exhibit showed a misdemeanor charge for violating former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.110, which proved that defendant violated a protection order issued under Wash. Rev. Code ch 26.50. A second exhibit showed that he had a misdemeanor conviction for violating former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.99.040, which was a conviction for violating a no contact order issued under a statute enumerated in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.110(5). Thus, either exhibit proved the second predicate conviction. The pleas entered in the two prior cases were constitutionally valid where the plea form that defendant signed and the judge accepted informed him of his right to call witnesses, which included the right to testify himself. The information was sufficient as it was not required to include that defendant's threat was a true threat. Finally, the doctrine of invited error barred defendant from claiming a jury instruction error as his proposed jury instructions had been given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant asserted that his guilty plea in one of his predicate convictions was constitutionally deficient, and argued that the trial court abused its discretion in amending the jury instructions before the jury's deliberations. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant's statements clearly evinced his knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to testify. By signing the forms, he stated that he understood that he was waiving several enumerated rights, including the right to confront witnesses and the right to remain silent. The advice of rights instructed defendant that he could choose to waive his right to remain silent and be questioned as any other witness. This was sufficient to advise him of his right to testify. As such, the State demonstrated the constitutional validity of the challenged conviction. Further, the trial court properly corrected an error before the jury began deliberating in order to reflect the terminology that both parties had agreed upon before the jury was originally instructed. There was no allegation that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions based on the law submitted to the jury in final form.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trial court initially continued the hearings and deferred its rulings pending appointment of new counsel and concerns over defendant's competency. After both deferred rulings, defendant allowed new counsel to represent him for substantial periods of time before changing his mind and reasserting his request to proceed pro se; and his persistent disruptions impaired the orderly administration of justice. As such, defendant was not entitled to claim that the timeliness of his motion should have been measured from the date of his first request. The sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant did not meet the &quot;same intent&quot; prong of the same criminal conduct test because over eight minutes elapsed between the first and second calls, and over 15 minutes between the second and third calls, and each call was clearly terminated.</SPAN></P>

The corporation paid approximately $ 85,853.86 for the enhanced food fish tax. The corporation argued that the legislature did not intend, under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.27.020(1), to tax the harvester of geoducks purchased from the DNR. However, the taxing statute, both before and after the 1985 amendment, required an excise tax on the commercial possession of enhanced food fish. Also, the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.27.020(1) supported the imposition of the enhanced food fish tax on the corporation because it was the first commercial owner of the geoducks. In addition, the tax did not apply to the DNR because it only regulated commercial geoduck harvesting and did not engage in the commercial possession of the geoducks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In early 2005, petitioner, who was confined as a sexually violent predator (SVP), sought an unconditional release trial pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090(2)(c)(ii)(A). The Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, struck petitioner's trial date based on amendments to Washington's SVP statute. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2004, the court decided In re Detention of Young in which an SVP offered expert opinion at his order to show cause hearing that his advanced age meant he was no longer likely to commit acts of predatory sexual violence and thus did not continue to meet the definition of an SVP. The expert opinion was based on actuarial risk assessment. The Young court held the evidence presented sufficient to show probable cause warranting a new commitment trial. In 2005, the legislature amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 finding the decision in Young to be contrary to the legislature's intent and established that a mere change in a demographic factor alone, such as age, was insufficient to establish probable cause warranting a new commitment trial. The court concluded that petitioner was entitled to a full evidentiary hearing. The triggering event for application of the 2005 amendments to the SVP statute was the initial probable cause hearing. Since petitioner's probable cause hearing occurred before the amendments to &sect; 71.09.090 came into effect in May 2005, their application to petitioner was improperly retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a Washington trial court, defendant was convicted of methamphetamine manufacture. Defendant appealed, arguing that the search that revealed a &quot;rolling methamphetamine lab&quot; in the trunk of the car he was driving was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State conceded that an initial warrantless search of the trunk was unlawful, but argued that the affidavit supporting a subsequent search, absent the improperly obtained information, was sufficient to establish probable cause to search the trunk. The challenged evidence was seized not during the initial search, but during the subsequent search. The trial court had made no findings as to whether police officers would have sought a warrant for the trunk if they had not illegally seen the trunk's contents. Accordingly, the appellate court held that remand was necessary for the trial court to resolve this factual issue. If the trial court were to find that the officers would have sought a warrant, the next issue would be whether an issuing magistrate could have found probable cause to issue the warrant based on the officers' affidavit with the improper parts excised. The appellate court went on to hold that a magistrate could have reasonably inferred that the contraband found on defendant and in the passenger compartment established probable cause to believe the officers would find more in the trunk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for the trial court to find, after further hearing if necessary, whether the officers would have sought a search warrant for the car's trunk even if they had not known of the truck's contents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent employer terminated appellant employee, the employee and his wife sued the employer for: (1) not paying overtime compensation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.46.130(1); (2) wrongful withholding of wages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.48.010; and (3) willful failure to pay wages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.52.050(2). A Washington trial court granted the employer summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was an interstate truck driver. The employer asserted that the employee had never worked overtime within the state of Washington and that it had no obligation to pay him overtime for hours worked in other states. However, the appellate court held that a Washington-based employee had to be paid overtime even when the overtime hours accrued outside of the state. Although the employee was an Oregon resident, he was a Washington-based employee because: (1) the employer was a Washington corporation situated in Washington; (2) the employee traveled into Washington to the employer's terminal, where he was dispatched on his trucking routes; (3) when he finished a route, he would return to the Washington-based terminal, where he would file his bills of lading, await further dispatches, and receive his paychecks. Thus, his Oregon residency was irrelevant to his Washington-based employment. Such a holding did not violate the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause. However, because there was a bona fide wages dispute, the appellate court denied the employee's request for double damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.52.070.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment, awarded damages and prejudgment interest to the employee, and remanded for the trial court to determine the amount of attorney fees that the employee was entitled to recover for the proceedings below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Superior Court, King County (Washington), found defendant guilty of second degree murder under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.050 and also found that he was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime. The trial judge sentenced him to 183 months of confinement, the low end of the standard range, plus a mandatory deadly weapon enhancement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State treated differently similarly situated persons - those who committed an assault that resulted in death - by charging some of them with intentional murder and some of them with felony murder under the second degree murder statute. The felony murder statute was rationally related to the stated goal of punishing those who committed a homicide in the course of and in furtherance of a felony in the same manner as those who intended to kill. The elements of felony murder were the intent to shoot the victim with unlawful force with a deadly weapon, and causing the victim's death in the course of and in furtherance of the crime of assault. The elements of intentional murder were shooting the victim with the intent to cause the victim's death, and the shot causing the victim's death. The intent to commit the assault (which proximately caused death) and the intent to cause a death were different, requiring different proof. Because the intentional murder and felony murder statutes under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.050(1)(a) and (b) required proof of different elements, they did not violate the equal protection clauses in Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant was properly denied where the supporting affidavits were specific about his activities and the incriminating items found during the search incident to his arrest. It was also reasonable to infer that evidence relating to his preparations would be found in defendant's locker at a gun shop where the evidence showed that he had created and test-fired a homemade silencer in preparation for the crime and had rented a locker at the gun shop several weeks before the shooting. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses as first-degree assault was not a lesser included offense of attempted first degree murder. Application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(y) to defendant did not violate the ex post facto doctrine as the statutory aggravating circumstance was consistent with the legal principles previously established in case law. An exceptional sentence based on the victim's injuries was warranted as injury was not an element of first degree attempted murder. Finally, defendant's planning justified the exceptional sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(m).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Superior Court, King County (Washington), found defendant guilty of second degree rape for sexually assaulting a developmentally disabled woman. As a condition of his sentence, the trial court ordered that he have no contact with the victim, members of her family, and all vulnerable, ill, or disabled adults without the supervision of a responsible adult who had knowledge of his conviction. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's jury instruction adequately addressed the requirement of jury unanimity such that an ordinary juror would interpret it to mean that the jury had to be unanimous on the act underlying a conviction. However, the statutory terms &quot;vulnerable adult&quot; and &quot;developmental disability&quot; were more specific than the general terms &quot;vulnerable&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; used in the no contact community placement condition. Because there was no indication that the trial court intended to limit the terms of the order to the statutory definitions in Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.44.010(16) and 71A.10.020(3), the appellate court would not presume it did so or otherwise rewrite the trial court's order. But, because ordinary people could differ about the meaning and application of the term &quot;ill&quot; adults, it had to be stricken from the no contact order as vague. Also, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712(5), defendant's community custody was equal to the remainder of his natural life once he was released from custody because the maximum term for the offense was life. Finally, the terms &quot;vulnerable&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; adults accurately described the class of people victimized by defendant and were not overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the case to the trial court to clarify the terms &quot;vulnerable&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; in the no contact order and to strike the term &quot;ill&quot; from the no contact order.</SPAN></P>

R. 7.8(b), appellant inmate, who was convicted in August 1997 of one count of first degree assault and two counts of reckless endangerment, moved for relief from judgment in March 2007. The Spokane County Superior Court, Washington, denied the inmate's motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that his judgment and sentence should be vacated because his offender score was miscalculated. The instant court concluded that the inmate's motion was untimely because it was filed well after the one-year time limit set forth in rule 7.8(b). The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the inmate's motion for relief from judgment. The inmate's sentence was not facially invalid. The 1997 judgment and sentence, on its face, correctly reflected that the inmate's offender score was a 9 or more for each of the three counts sentenced. The sentencing court calculated the inmate's offender score by adding one point for each of the following: two other current offenses, one other current conviction listed under a different cause number, and eight prior convictions constituting criminal history. The score totaled 11 if each offense counted as one point. Even if two 1980 convictions and two 1983 convictions counted as one offense, as the inmate contended, his offender score would have been 9. Every ground that the inmate asserted was untimely, and every ground failed to satisfy any exception to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090's one-year time limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the inmate's motion for relief from judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a Washington trial court convicting him of third-degree assault in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for beating his girlfriend, and after his arrest, attempting to escape from a police car and biting a detective. The trial court imposed terms of community custody of nine to 18 months for two counts of third-degree assault and third-degree rape and 36 to 48 months for third-degree rape. On appeal, the court held that because the terms of community custody exceeded the period allowed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505(5), the case had to be remanded for resentencing. Defendant's convictions of third-degree assault and attempted escape did not violate his right against double jeopardy because the assault was not necessary to the attempted escape, as defendant would have committed acts providing the basis for his conviction of attempted escape even if he had not bitten the deputy. Defendant's convictions of malicious mischief and attempted escape did not violate defendant's right against double jeopardy because malicious mischief required proof of a different mental state, knowledge and malice, than attempted escape, intent to escape from custody. The seizure and admission into evidence of letters found in defendant's cell did not violate Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The portion of defendant's sentence concerning community custody was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing in such a fashion that any term of community custody imposed did not exceed the period of early release defendant earned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to 25 counts of first degree theft, and stipulated to the facts in the State's certification of probable cause. A trial court, Washington, imposed an exceptional sentence of 108 months on all 25 counts to be served concurrently, but consecutive to any previously imposed sentence, with credit for time already served. Defendant appealed the imposition of the exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the exceptional sentence imposed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) violated his Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution right to a jury trial. The trial court found that defendant had committed multiple current offenses, and that his high offender score would result in some of the current offenses going unpunished. It concluded as a matter of law that there were substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. The trial court stated specifically that it was imposing an exceptional sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c). Defendant stipulated to the facts, and agreed with the State's understanding of his criminal history and the calculation of his offender score. Under those circumstances, the court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) permitted the judge to impose an exceptional sentence. The fact that the judge, rather than a jury, made the findings necessary to impose defendant's exceptional sentence did not implicate the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While incarcerated in a county jail, defendant removed the screen from his cell window and then used the screen to break the window. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his proposed jury instruction regarding a constitutional right to outdoor exercise and in the definitional instruction of malice. The instant court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the proposed instruction because the instruction did not accurately state the law and was misleading and confusing. Although defendant was denied yard time, he did have access to the dayroom for indoor exercise. The record suggested both security and maintenance concerns were reasons for curbing outdoor exercise. Defendant's proposed instruction was merely theoretical. Moreover, this was not a civil suit over jail conditions, and no authority allowed an escapee to get fresh air or exercise. Although defendant claimed that the State failed to provide evidence to support an inference of malicious intent, the evidence showed defendant damaged jail property and laughed about it, creating an inference of malice. Thus, the evidence supported the instruction defining malice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of third degree child rape, and two counts of first degree incest. On appeal defendant only challenged his conviction of first degree incest relating to his oldest daughter. The oldest daughter become pregnant, and blood tests showed that the likelihood ratio that defendant was the father was 640,000 to 1. The appellate court ruled that exhibit 2A, the blood draw form, was a non-testimonial business record. The blood draw form contained only verifiable facts, it did not contain an accusatory statement, cross examination would be impractical and unnecessary, and cross examination would not further the truth-seeking purpose of the Confrontation Clause. The admission of the document into evidence did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. Also, the trial court did not violate defendant's equal protection rights in imposing his exceptional sentence. Defendant had not established that he was being treated differently than defendants who pled guilty or that his right to a jury trial was violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the trial court (Washington), which convicted him of first-degree aggravated murder in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.020(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for the first-degree aggravated murder of his wife, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient. He had access to the murder weapon and forensic experts identified the murder weapon; defendant was at the site of the victim's murder with the murder weapon; witnesses saw a dark-colored pickup truck at the murder scene shortly before the body was found; and defendant owned a blue pickup truck and was seen putting a rifle into the truck hours before the murder. The jury could have found that defendant was unhappy with his wife because he believed she was having an affair. Thus, viewed in favor of the State, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict defendant of murdering his wife. His argument that the aggravating factor charged by the State was void for vagueness was without merit because the State proved that defendant parked his truck fairly close to the victim's car. And he shot the victim from within five feet of her car. Under those circumstances, any reasonable person would have been on notice that he was firing from within the immediate vicinity of the vehicle he used to get to the scene with the weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree child molestation, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.083(1). After the Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington) ruled that the victim was not competent to testify and that her statements to others were not admissible, it granted defendant's motion to suppress the statement he made during a police interview, held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.035 was unconstitutional, and dismissed the charge. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that defendant's statement was trustworthy, but was inadmissible because the State failed to introduce independent evidence that criminal conduct at the core of the offense had occurred. However, the trial court failed to properly apply the factors set out in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.035 as the case law did not support its conclusion that corroboration was a federal constitutional requirement. Assuming arguendo that the corpus delicti rule was grounded in due process principles, the statute satisfied the core due process requirements by demanding some indication of reliability before an inculpatory statement was submitted to a jury. The statute also ensured that defendant could argue that the statement was not trustworthy or was otherwise insufficient to support a conviction. Thus, the statute was a lawful exercise of legislative authority and the trial court erred by refusing to analyze the admissibility of defendant's trustworthy statement under the factors set out in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court to apply each of the statutory factors to defendant's statement, determine the statement's admissibility, and conduct further hearings as appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the State presented sufficient evidence to establish that defendant intentionally touched the victim, thereby recklessly inflicting substantial bodily harm. A witness testified about the events she had observed from outside her motel room. The State also presented the 911 dispatch tape, which corroborated the witness's testimony. The appellate court deferred to the jury's finding defendant and the victim not credible. The jurors' inadvertent observations of defendant outside of the courtroom did not affect his right to a fair trial. Defendant was not entitled to an involuntary intoxication instruction as the record did not contain ample evidence that his level of intoxication affected his ability or lack thereof to form the mental state required to establish the crimes charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sued respondent county and State, asserting an inverse condemnation claim for their land and homes that were swept down river during high waters, allegedly as a result of a blockage caused by a dike owned and maintained by the county and State. The Superior Court of Douglas County (Washington) granted the county and State summary judgment. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common enemy doctrine did not insulate the county and State from damage caused by diking where the landowners had presented evidence that the waters held back by the dike would have otherwise flowed through natural side channels and rejoined the river. The character of the water was an issue of fact, and thus, the landowners had raised an issue of material fact as to whether the legal rule regarding riparian waters applied. Moreover, the landowners had presented evidence that the side channel drainways constituted flood channels under that legal rule. The county and State did not have immunity under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 86.12.037 and 86.16. 071 as the claim was for an unconstitutional taking; the landowners had not asserted a tort claim. The arguments that the governmental actions did not constitute a takings because the damage to the landowners' property was not contemplated by the county and State and it was not necessarily incident to the construction of the dike were rejected as the unintended results of governmental activity could constitute a taking. The landowners had also presented issues of fact as to the county's and State's roles with respect to dike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Snohomish County (Washington), convicted defendant, upon a plea of guilty, of 11 counts in three separate cause numbers. The trial court found the aggravating factor set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) to be satisfied and premised the imposition of an exceptional sentence on the existence of that factor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) allowed the trial court to impose an exceptional sentence on the basis of a factual finding that, under the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in Blakely, was the sole province of the jury. Thus, defendant contended that the trial court unconstitutionally applied Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) when it imposed an exceptional sentence. Defendant's convictions for the multiple current offenses for which he was sentenced were each individually subject to the right of trial by jury and to the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Those same convictions, in combination with defendant's prior convictions, resulted in his high offender score. Those factors, in turn, provided the basis for the trial court's imposition of an exceptional sentence pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c). Because the fact of defendant's criminal convictions provided the sole basis for the imposition of his exceptional sentence, he failed to meet his burden of showing that the trial court's application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) violated the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first degree rape of a child. The trial court sentenced him to life in prison with a standard minimum range sentence of 160 months. As a condition of community custody, defendant could not purchase, possess, or view any pornographic material. Defendant argued that the condition of community custody was unconstitutionally vague on its face. On review, the Court of Appeals of Washington upheld the sentencing condition. The Washington Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A, authorized the imposition of crime-related prohibitions as a part of community placement. The order limiting defendant from sexually stimulating materials and environments related directly to an aspect of his crime. The condition was appropriate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his first degree escape conviction because the State failed to prove an essential element of first degree escape--that he escaped from lawful custody when the deputy attempted to arrest him based on the electronic Department of Corrections (DOC) warrant. The appellate court found that because the deputy was allowed to rely on the DOC's information indicating that defendant had an outstanding arrest warrant, this information gave him probable cause to arrest; when defendant escaped from the deputy, he was under lawful arrest based on the electronic DOC arrest warrant. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.110(1) required and the instructions supported proof of a single mental state--&quot;knowing&quot; escape from custody. Instruction 10 was proper as its definition of &quot;lawful arrest&quot; neither commented on the evidence nor directed a verdict. The trial court did not err in refusing to define &quot;arrest.&quot; Defendant's motion to suppress his escape was denied as it occurred after the deputy discovered the warrant and informed defendant. Defendant's motion for mistrial was denied. Defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions for first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary, and two counts of second-degree assault and the appellate court affirmed in part but reversed the second-degree assault convictions. The trial court did not err in allowing evidence of a showup identification, in part because sufficient evidence supported the conviction even without the pretrial identification. Defendants did not contend that the pretrial identification tainted the subsequent in-court identification by the victims. Thus, the admission of the pretrial identification was merely cumulative evidence. The trial court did not err in determining that the first defendant understood the nature of the charges and had the ability to assist his defense because a colloquy demonstrated that he could articulate and understand the nature of the charges, as well as the roles of the judge, prosecutor, and counsel. The second-degree assault convictions were improper because neither the trial testimony, the State's closing argument, nor the jury instructions referred to, or indicated to, an independent purpose of design that would have separated the robbery from the assault on that victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Snohomish County Superior Court (Washington) convicting him of felony and misdemeanor telephone harassment in violation of Wash.

Defendant was also ordered not to have any contact with the victim and was ordered not to appear within the city's limits unless required for legal or judicial reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for leaving a threatening message on the voice mail of the victim, a police officer, who had previously investigated defendant. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 9.61.230 did not require the State to prove that the caller had the intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass at the time the call was placed, and therefore the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because there was ample evidence that he had the requisite intent at many times during the telephone call. Prosecuting defendant for making calls that were allegedly a lawful petition to a government official for redress of grievances did not violate his First Amendment rights because while defendant may have been legally voicing disapproval about the way in which the victim handled the investigation, once he used speech to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass the victim, his conduct became criminal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation, three in the first degree and two in the second degree, and of communication with a minor for immoral purposes. He was resentenced to consecutive sentences for the offenses, pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(i) (2003). The sentence was affirmed on appeal. Review was granted, and the Supreme Court of Washington remanded for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Child molestation in the first degree was not established by statute as a serious violent offense. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(a)(1), consecutive sentences for felonies not established as serious violent offenses could only be imposed under the exceptional sentence provisions of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535. Defendant argued that the exceptional sentences violated Blakely because the judge, rather than the jury, conducted the fact finding necessary to justify them. Based on the supreme court's holding in the Matter of the Personal Restraint of VanDelft, the court agreed. When the trial court imposed consecutive sentences of confinement for convictions for multiple felonies that were not defined as serious violent offenses, it imposed exceptional sentences. The sentences were premised upon the trial court's determination that the imposition of concurrent sentences would result in punishment that was clearly too lenient. Because the U.S. Constitution required that such a finding be made by a jury, rather than by a judge, and no procedure existed at the time of defendant's convictions for his jury to make such a finding, the sentences had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the challenged sentences, ordered them vacated, and remanded the case to the trial court with directions that standard range sentences be imposed upon him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners entered into a developer extension agreement with respondent water district. The owners sued the district to obtain a refund of a water connection fee, alleging that the district did not have the authority under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 57.08.005(10) to require the owners to pay a fee. A trial court, Washington, granted the district's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the lawsuit. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended that because they were not connected to the district's &quot;existing&quot; water system and the water was supplied by another water district, the district did not have the authority to impose a water connection fee. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 57.08.005(10) explicitly authorized the district the right to impose a connection charge on property owners seeking to connect to the district's systems, as a condition to granting the right to so connect. The court found that the plain language of the statute did not limit a connection charge to the cost of an &quot;existing system.&quot; The district had the exclusive authority to provide water service to the area and to the owners. The district's comprehensive plan approved construction of a project in order to provide additional capacity to serve the area. As agreed in a developer extension agreement, the district owned the water lines that connected the owners to the water supply. And, the water the district temporarily purchased from the other district was provided to the owners through a water system owned and operated by the district. Thus, the district had the authority to impose a water connection fee under &sect; 57.08.005(10).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worker sued respondent Department of Transportation, Alaska Marine Highway System, pursuant to the Jones Act, seeking to recover damages and a declaratory judgment that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.250(5) violated the Alaska and United States constitutions. An Alaskan superior court entered an order granting Alaska's motion for summary judgment. The Superior Court, Whatcom, Washington, declined to exercise jurisdiction. The worker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was a resident of Alaska. The worker was injured while working aboard an Alaska state ferry. At the time of the worker's injury, the ferry was in the approaches to Cordova harbor, within Alaska's territorial waters. The Washington superior court action was filed 10 days before summary judgment was granted in the Alaskan matter, but the two cases were identical. Alaska moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(1) on the theory that Alaska's sovereign immunity in its own courts as to Jones Act claims pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.250(5) also removed the Washington superior court's power to hear such claims brought against Alaska. Alaska's motion also separately contended that the superior court should decline to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of interstate comity. The Washington court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over claims brought against Alaska, as a sister state. The matter was still pending before the Alaska Supreme Court, and declining to exercise jurisdiction would allow the Alaska the first opportunity to examine the constitutional validity of its own rules and regulations.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Because the mother did not engage in the services that were offered and provided, the mother's argument that the State had to provide additional services failed. The parental deficiency that necessitated removal of the children was chronic neglect of the children that jeopardized their health, safety, and welfare. The State offered and provided the mother numerous services over a three-year period, including parenting classes, therapeutic day care, and counseling with two different family preservation service therapists. The mother agreed to complete parenting classes and obtain a psychological evaluation to identify any other parenting deficiencies that the State could address. But the mother did not follow through with any of the services the State offered or provided and both therapists eventually terminated services because the mother cancelled and missed so many appointments. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that it would have been futile to offer additional services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a bartender and a bar, appealed the judgment rendered in a Washington trial court that found them liable for negligently overserving alcohol to defendant decedent who injured respondents, vehicle occupants, in an automobile accident. Respondents cross-appealed contending that the interest rate on tort judgments violated their constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the evidence as to overserving was insufficient to sustain the verdict. The court of appeals agreed. Witnesses testified that the bartender admitted that the decedent was drunk when he left the bar. That did not prove overservice. The bartender's statements, as related by the witnesses, was not sufficient evidence to forestall a directed verdict. That evidence was not sufficient to establish the decedent's appearance at the time of service of alcohol. Because the purpose was to protect against foreseeable hazards resulting from service to an intoxicated person, the duty only applied to the service of alcohol to those already exhibiting signs of the influence of alcohol. The bar could not be held liable when a patron was not &quot;apparently under the influence&quot; when served. As long as the bartender did not serve the decedent after he &quot;appeared&quot; under the influence, neither she, nor the bar, were liable for respondents' injuries. Since, no evidence described the decedent's state of intoxication when the bartender served him, substantial evidence did not support the verdict against appellants for overservice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and vacated. The cross-appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of rape of a child in the second degree. Based on defendant's criminal history, a trial court, Washington, sentenced defendant to a maximum term of life and a minimum term of 129 months in prison. He received community custody for life upon release from confinement. The trial court adopted 21 community custody conditions. Defendant brought a pre-enforcement challenge to two of the conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that two of his community custody provisions were unconstitutionally vague. Claims of vagueness were better assessed after enforcement, with a record of specific conduct. The court affirmed a prior decision to forgo facial challenges for vagueness on sentencing conditions. Defendant claimed that a prohibition against possessing pornography and visiting establishments whose primary business pertained to sexually explicit or erotic material was overbroad because no nexus existed between his crime and the condition. The circumstances of the sexual assault reflected defendant's inability to regulate his sexual behavior. Limiting defendant's access to sexually stimulating materials was proper under the Washington Sentencing Reform Act and not overbroad. Defendant's sentence included the requirement that he not possess or control any item designated or used to entertain, attract, or lure children. The intent to use these items to make contact with children, not their mere possession, related to the circumstances of the crime of second degree rape of a child. Without intent, the prohibition did not qualify as an appropriate crime-related prohibition under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prohibitions against pornography and frequenting establishments whose primary business pertained to sexually explicit or erotic material were affirmed. The condition concerning defendant's possession or control of items designated or used to entertain, attract, or lure children was remanded for clarification with respect to intent.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, noting that: (1) the threat was made in a small conference room with two adults present; (2) defendant made the statement while in an agitated and angry state, a context which established that the statement was not made in jest but, rather, was a serious threat; and (3) the statement placed the teacher in reasonable fear of bodily injury, as the record provided sufficient evidence of defendant's history of physical violence and his threatening behaviors at the time the statement was made.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the inmates filed their PRPs more than one year after their respective judgments became final, and the PRPs did not fall within an exemption or an exception to the one-year limit. The inmates' claim for relief did not satisfy the time-bar exceptions for convictions under an unconstitutional statute as applied, for double jeopardy violations, for sentences in excess of jurisdiction, or for a significant change in merger law. Also, when the inmates pled guilty to both kidnapping and robbery, they admitted a sufficient factual basis for both charges.

The appellate court agreed, finding that a recent state supreme court's decision held that &sect; 9.94A.537 applied to all criminal cases where trials had not begun or pleas had not been accepted before its effective date. And contrary to defendant's assertion, double jeopardy considerations did not apply because no judge or jury had even considered, much less acquitted, defendant of the allegations on which the aggravating circumstances were based. The sentencing court's refusal to use the recently enacted statutory procedure to consider whether any aggravating circumstances applied could not be characterized as a resolution of guilt or innocence, and the State was not seeking to punish defendant twice for the same criminal conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was parked in front of appellant arrestee's driveway. After he refused to move his patrol car and told her that he would deal with her later, she drove around the officer's car. He then arrested her for obstructing a law enforcement officer. Subsequently, she filed a suit for false arrest. The Superior Court, Spokane County (Washington) granted appellee city's motion for summary judgment and dismissed her case. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee's truck was sitting on her driveway when the police stopped another vehicle. The officer parked his patrol car in front of her driveway. She tried to talk to the officer and have him move his car, but he told her to shut up and back up and that he would deal with her later. She then drove across a blacktopped portion of her front yard and around the officer. He stopped and then arrested her. She was charged with obstructing a law enforcement officer under Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 10.07.032. The appellate court stated that more was required of the arrestee than driving around a parked car after an officer told her to shut up and that he would deal with her later to find that she obstructed the officer, or, at least, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her actions of driving around the patrol car obstructed the officer in his official duties. Thus, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officer had probable cause to believe that the arrestee knowingly or willfully acted to obstruct the law enforcement officer in his official duties as required. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting the city's summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment summarily dismissing the arrestee's claim and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department's policy categorically prevented approval of a sex offender's release plan if a forensic evaluation determined that the inmate met the criteria of a sexually violent predator because no proposed community release plan would be deemed sufficiently safe to ensure community protection. Neither the current nor the former versions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.728 authorized the Department to categorically exempt sex offenders who meet the criteria of sexually violent predators, nor did the statute allow the Department to decide to refuse to approve a release plan because no community release address, absent one with a 24/7 prison-like monitoring and lock-down, would be safe enough to protect the community. Even if a forensic evaluation concluded that the inmate met the criteria of a sexually violent predator, 24/7 prison-like monitoring and lock-down could only be accomplished within the constraints of due process by means of a civil commitment proceeding. Until then, the Department could not categorically exempt a sex offender like the inmate from consideration for transfer to community custody and had to evaluate his proposed release plan on its merits.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised many issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. The to-convict instructions for each of four counts of offering false instrument for filing or record could have been read as a direction or as a comment by the trial court that the documents referenced were false instruments. However, the error was harmless because the record was replete with evidence that the instruments were false and no juror could have found that the documents were not false instruments, and thus no showing of prejudice was made. The statutory aggravating factor was that defendant knew or should have known that the victim was vulnerable under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(b), and the jury was properly instructed that it had to find this factor proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus the requirements of case law were satisfied. All the elements of the crime and the enhanced sentence factor were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, thus satisfying due process concerns, and because the findings were made by a unanimous jury, this satisfied U.S. Amend. VI concerns. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the venire selection process failed to comply with the requirements of the applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged an order of a trial court (Washington), which modified the parties' parenting plan pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.191 by limiting the residential time the father spent with the children and giving respondent mother all decision-making authority based upon the father's physical and emotional abuse of the children. The trial court awarded the mother attorney's fees and refused to seal the records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father allegedly physically and emotionally abused his children. The trial court found that there was an impairment of emotional ties between the father and his children, which interfered with his performance of parenting functions. The father displayed dominant, manipulative and intimidating behavior. On appeal, the court found that the terms &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;impairment&quot; in &sect; 26.09.191 were inherently serious and not unconstitutionally vague because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.44.015 distinguished between abuse and reasonable corporal punishment. A doctor testified that the father was severely controlling, and the father admitted that he had an anger management problem. The father did not establish that his interest in securing employment outweighed the right of the public to open judicial proceedings to support sealing the records. The imposition of attorney's fees was proper when the father used the courts as a means of perpetuating his need to intimidate and he took inconsistent positions with respect to the same factual events. However, the trial court should have reduced the fees by the amount that the mother admitted were erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment modifying the parenting plan and denying the motion to seal or redact the findings regarding abuse, but the court remanded the action for a recalculation of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from a trial court (Washington), which denied his motion to dismiss and convicted him of failure to register as a sex offender, contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(5)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to first-degree child molestation when he was 13 years old. As a result of the conviction, he was required to register as a sex offender under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130. The State later charged him with failure to register when he moved, in violation of &sect; 9A.44.130(5)(a). Defendant moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that the statute provided insufficient procedural due process for a sex offender who registered a change of address. He asserted that the statute needed to require the sheriff to provide a registrant with a receipt or other confirmation. Defendant was convicted of the charge. On appeal, the court found that defendant did not show that the lack of a copy requirement in the statutory registration procedures was a deficiency that deprived a sex offender of a liberty or property interest, in violation of Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. Defendant did not show that the registration requirement infringed upon his right to travel. While prudence might dictate that an offender request a copy or other confirmation of registration, there was no constitutional necessity for the sheriff to offer such protection because no state deprivation of liberty occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court (Washington) of, in part, first degree burglary with a firearm and second degree assault with a firearm. Defendant had pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Defendant appealed and the State also appealed, challenging the trial court's imposition of a concurrent firearm enhancement on the second degree assault count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the State raised various arguments. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court disagreed with defendant's claim that the information regarding burglary was insufficient, for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The information mirrored Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.020(1). Under the statute, unlawfully entering or remaining in a building was an essential element of burglary. While ownership or occupancy might have been necessary to prove that entry was unlawful, neither ownership nor occupancy was an essential element of burglary, as defendant argued. The court disagreed that the in-court identification was tainted by an impermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedure. Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6 did not apply and the motion to exclude the identification was properly denied. Defendant's guilty plea to unlawful possession of a firearm was involuntary and the court reversed the conviction and remanded for defendant to plead anew. The trial court acted outside its statutory authority when it imposed a concurrent, rather than consecutive, firearm enhancement to his conviction of second degree assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the sentence on the second degree assault count and remanded for a new sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Washington Department of Labor &amp; Industries, ordered appellant contractor to pay the industrial insurance premiums that a subcontractor did not pay under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.12.070. The Washington Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals adopted the industrial appeals judge's decision affirming the Department's order. The Thurston Superior Court (Washington) affirmed the Board's decision. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor presented no evidence that the subcontractor maintained a principal place of business, on the owner's kitchen table or anywhere else, that the owner used exclusively to conduct the subcontractor's business. Also, the regular invoices and cancelled checks supported a conclusion that the subcontractor maintained records of at least its dealings with the contractor, but the Department's auditor testified that the owner did not produce a complete set of records for the audit. Also, the contractor produced no further evidence that the subcontractor maintained records of all income, including income from sources other than the contractor, or any business expenses. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the contractor did not present sufficient evidence to prove that the subcontractor maintained a separate set of books and records that reflected all items of income and expenses of the business. Therefore, the Board did not err in finding that the subcontractor did not meet the requirements for the prime contractor liability exception. Accordingly, the Department did not err in seeking the subcontractor's unpaid industrial insurance premiums from the contractor.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that when defendant entered his Alford plea, he was aware he would be assessed costs and fines. Although defendant was aware that the State recommended financial obligations at the time of sentencing, he neither objected to those costs nor put forth evidence regarding his inability to pay. Unless the State was seeking to collect those costs, the time to object to the imposition of that fine was then. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.160(4) entitled a defendant to petition the court for modification or remission of the court-imposed costs if making payments imposed a manifest hardship on the defendant. Indeed, post-sentencing, the issue of the costs may not be ripe for review until the State attempted to collect them. A trial court in exercising its discretion to impose costs did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant made at least nine calls to four victims on the same day and during the same general time period. Each call began almost immediately with a threatening tirade predicated on defendant's dismissal from employment. Nothing in the record suggested that the calls had any purpose other than to harass and intimidate the victims. Defendant's obsession with his expulsion over a long period of time, his express vendetta against his victims, the angry tone of his threats, his appearance at the home of one victim, and his escalation to describing exactly how he would kill his victims all supported the conclusion that a reasonable person in his position would have foreseen his listeners taking his threats seriously. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Snohomish Superior Court, Washington, granted the State's motion to strike the trial date where the legislature amended the statute governing sexually violent predator (SVP) annual order to show cause hearings to preclude granting a new trial solely on the basis of a change of single demographic factor, including age. Appellant patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that striking his trial date constituted retroactive application of new legislation in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The appellate court found that a prior court determined that a vested right, entitled to protection from legislation, had to be something more than a mere expectation based upon an anticipated continuance of the existing law. An expectation that there would be no change in the SVP criteria under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 did not vest existing SVPs with a right to have recommitment hearing requests evaluated according to the pre-2005 criteria. The amended statute applied to the patient prospectively, not retrospectively as a trial had not yet been held. The application of the statutory amendment did not violate the patient's due process rights. An SVP retained adequate procedural protections to safeguard against commitment if and when they no longer met the criteria of an SVP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that because a polygraph was not a condition of his community placement, the department of corrections (DOC) did not have the authority to conduct a polygraph. The court of appeals disagreed. There was no dispute that the trial court required defendant to participate in &quot;crime-related treatment or counseling services as directed by the department&quot; as a condition of community placement. While incarcerated, defendant enrolled in a sex offender treatment program. The aftercare phase of the program occurred during community placement and the treatment contract required periodic polygraph examinations to monitor compliance. Therefore, the DOC had the authority to require polygraph examinations as part of the treatment program that was expressly imposed by the trial court. Additionally, to establish chain of custody for fingerprint evidence on a DVD disk, the State presented the testimony of the court clerk and security officers who were present during the first trial. The witnesses testified that they did not see defendant touch the DVD. Therefore, the trial court's decision to admit fingerprint testimony about the DVD was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighters challenged a decision of respondent city firemen's pension board, which prospectively calculated the benefits they would have received under their prior pension plan under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 41.18 (1955 Act) using the 1955 Act salary definition instead of the definition under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 41.26.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the firefighters retired, the city determined that excess payments were incorrectly calculated.

Code &sect; 41.26.040(2), the firefighters had the right to be treated as if they retired under the 1955 Act. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.040(2) required the pension board to calculate the benefits under the 1955 Act and then compare that to what the firefighters would receive under the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' System Pension Plan (LEOFF), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 41.26. If the amount was greater under the 1955 Act, they were entitled to an excess benefit payment under Wash. Rev. Code. &sect; 41.26.040(2). The city had to use the 1955 Act salary definition under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.18.030 to calculate the amount the firefighters would have received to determine whether they were entitled to an excess payment. Because the legislature amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.040(2) before the LEOFF retirement system took effect, the firefighters did not have the right to the contribution rate under the 1955 Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Washington trial court convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of first degree manslaughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in requiring him to pay the VPA and restitution because the victim was killed while attempting to commit a felony. The appellate court found that even assuming the victim's survivors may not have qualified for benefits under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.68.070 because he was killed while attempting to commit a crime, this did not eliminate the court's authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;7.68.035 to require defendant to pay the VPA. The VPA was paid into a fund. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;9.94A.753(5), the trial court had the authority to order restitution because defendant pleaded guilty to fatally injuring the victim. The statute did not require that the victim be &quot;innocent.&quot; Defendant agreed to pay restitution in full to the victim on charged counts in his plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the mother, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which found in favor of respondent, the former stepfather (stepfather), and denied the mother's motion to dismiss the stepfather's petition seeking residential time with the child. The stepfather was also made a de facto parent and a guardian ad litem was appointed for the child; the mother's motion to revise the orders was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue in the case was whether the stepfather had a cause of action as a de facto parent for residential time with his former stepdaughter. The appellate court held that he did not. The superior court denied the mother's motion to dismiss the petition under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6) and also entered a temporary order making a threshold determination that the stepfather was a de facto parent and ordered a reunification process between him and his former stepdaughter. The other order appointed a guardian ad litem for the child and directed further actions. The mother's motion to revise those two orders was denied and the appellate court granted discretionary review. The appellate court held that the existing parenting plan governing residential time with the child could not be modified without the statutorily required showing of adequate cause, and that no good cause was shown. Failure to apply the modification requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.260 constituted an abuse of discretion. The trial court's statement of what constituted a prima facie case for de facto parenthood omitted reference to necessary factors. Accordingly, it was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the order denying the mother's motion to dismiss, the order on revision, and the two underlying orders. The stepfather's petition seeking visitation was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury determined that appellant was a sexually violent predator (SVP) and he was civilly committed by the Superior Court of Walla Walla County (Washington). Appellant challenged his commitment, asserting that the SVP statute was unconstitutionally vague, that his right to a unanimous jury verdict was violated, and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the commitment hearing because he was unlawfully imprisoned at the time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While there may be a degree of uncertainty in predictions of future violence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(7), the uncertainty did not rise to the level of unconstitutional vagueness. Moreover, any lack of definiteness was mitigated by other procedural protections that were attendant to SVP hearings, as well as the State's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Fact finders were not required to consider any particular time frame when making the determination. Therefore, the phrase, &quot;likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. Also, appellant's right to a unanimous jury verdict was not violated. Finally, &quot;lawful custody&quot; was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to a valid petition for civil commitment as a SVP. The question of the lawfulness of an individual's detention was a separate question, involving separate proceedings, and was not included in the inquiry as to whether an individual met the criteria for civil commitment as a SVP.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court County: Snohomish Superior Court (Washington) an order revoking his special sexual offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) after finding that defendant violated the conditions of his suspended sentence for first degree rape of a child by frequenting a place where minors were known to congregate, and by failing to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9.94A.634, did not require a court to consider willfulness before ordering incarceration for a violation of a condition that did not involve a financial obligation. By its terms, that section of the statute applied to orders regarding payment of legal financial obligations and community service obligations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a Washington trial court, defendant was convicted of first-degree child molestation. Besides imposing prison sentences, the trial court imposed lifetime community custody with various crime-related prohibitions and affirmative conditions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conditions imposed on defendant included: (1) requiring him to take an alcohol-dependency drug if his community corrections officer so directed; (2) prohibiting possession of alcohol; (3) prohibiting visiting places where alcoholic beverages were the primary sale item; (4) prohibiting possession of drug paraphernalia; and (5) prohibiting the possession of deadly weapons. The appellate court noted that although a trial court was authorized under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505(8) to impose crime-related prohibitions and affirmative conditions when a defendant committed certain crimes, including first-degree child molestation, conditions that did not reasonably relate to the circumstances of the crime were unlawful unless explicitly permitted by statute. None of the first three conditions had been shown to be reasonably related to defendant's crime. Thus, unless the State came forward on remand with evidence connecting the crime with the first three conditions, the trial court would have to strike those conditions. The trial court was also directed to strike the last two conditions as not authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, sought review of the decision of the Pierce County Juvenile Court (Washington), which found him guilty of molesting five of his young female family members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of molesting five of his young female family members; on appeal the court affirmed. A nurse's testimony was admitted under both Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120 and Wash. R. Evid. 803(a)(4) and appellant did not challenge the admission of the statement under Wash. R. Evid. 803(a)(4). Thus, it was assumed that the trial court properly admitted the child's statement to the nurse under R. 803(a)(4) and did not address the admissibility of victim one's statements to the nurse under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120. The evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for first-degree child molestation pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.083 because victim one told a forensic child interviewer that appellant approached her, pulled her pants down, and touched her buttocks. His conviction for indecent liberties was appropriate because there was sufficient evidence showing that, at different times, appellant pulled down victim one's and victim five's pants and touched their bare buttocks. His conviction for indecent exposure was proper because there was evidence supporting the finding that appellant knew that his actions would cause reasonable affront or alarm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother's child resided with appellant, the child's aunt, until the mother petitioned to modify the parenting plan. Although the mother's petition did not meet the standards necessary for modification under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.260, the Washington trial court found that the language in the parenting plan created an alternate modification process. The aunt appealed the modification order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the parenting plan referred to modification upon a noncustodial parent's successful completion of a drug treatment program - which was a situation that would not support a modification petition under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.260 because it was not a substantial change in the circumstances of either the child or the aunt - that reference demonstrated that the parties and the trial court contemplated that modification could take place without meeting the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.260. Furthermore, the child's safety and welfare were still protected by the parenting plan criteria set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.187, even if Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.260 was not applied. Thus, because the aunt failed to foster the bond that the mother was developing with the child and the trial court's uncontested conclusion that modification was in the child's best interest, the trial court's modification order was consistent with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.187. Therefore, the trial court's modification order was proper because the parties agreed to a modification procedure alternative to the modification statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that development rights did not vest because the developer failed to file a building permit application before the city adopted new zoning and permit standards applicable to the developer's property. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.27.095(1) required the developer to submit a valid and fully complete building permit application for development rights to vest on the date of the application. Because the developer did not submit a building permit application, it failed to show that the hearing examiner erroneously interpreted Washington's vested rights doctrine or erroneously applied the law to the facts. No development rights vested when the developer filed an application for site development plan review. The city's development scheme was not so burdensome that it unconstitutionally frustrated vesting rights under ordinances and building codes in effect when a building permit was filed, nor did it conflict with statutory or case law controlling vesting of development rights. Accordingly, the court was not persuaded that the hearing examiner erroneously interpreted or applied the law or that the hearing examiner's decision was clearly erroneous or constitutionally flawed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery. The Washington trial court sentenced him to life-without-parole under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.570, based on his prior out-of-state felony convictions. Defendant challenged the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the POAA sentencing procedures were unconstitutional because they allowed the trial court to make factual findings about prior convictions, rather than requiring a jury to make those findings. The appellate court held that under the Almendarez-Torres, Apprendi, and Blakely rules, the POAA was a constitutionally permissible statute because it was a recidivism statute. A life sentence under the POAA depended only on the fact of prior convictions. Case law did not require a jury to decide the identity of the prior perpetrator, which was intrinsic to the clearly excepted fact of a prior conviction itself, given the case law's continued adherence to excepting the fact of prior conviction from the jury trial requirement. Therefore, defendant had no right to a jury trial on the issue of whether he was the person who committed previous strike offenses that subjected him to a POAA sentence of life without parole. Accordingly, the trial court properly entered findings about defendant's prior convictions, including his identity as the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public employee lost her job and was granted a year of commissioner approved training (CAT). When she quit a job while attending CAT, respondent Washington Department of Employment Security denied the benefits she already was receiving. An administrative law judge (ALJ) overturned the Department's holding, the commissioner rejected the ALJ's decision, and the Superior Court of King County, Washington, affirmed. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the employee challenged the commissioner's reversal of the ALJ's determination that she was not disqualified from receiving benefits pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.20.100 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.20.080 as she was not obligated to accept suitable positions while in CAT. The appellate court found that the commissioner's decision provided no authority for his determination that once the employee undertook work, she could quit only for good cause. The commissioner erred in concluding that he was not required to consider the suitability of the work under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.20.100. The ALJ was correct in concluding that the employee's leaving work after 11 days more properly constituted a refusal to work as allowed under the training provisions. This refusal did not disqualify the employee from receiving benefits. It was because the employee showed that the work was unsuitable that the ALJ correctly found she could refuse the work. Contrary to the commissioner's argument that the ALJ did not make any findings as to the suitability of the job, the ALJ specifically concluded the part-time job was unsuitable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner's decision was reversed and the decision of the ALJ was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed, finding that the Washington Supreme Court had ruled that such sentences, including exceptional sentences imposed in the form of consecutive sentences, were constitutionally invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens brought suit against respondents, a city and its mayor, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and other relief on the basis that the mayor's executive order granting employee benefits to city employees in same-sex marriages was invalid. The Superior Court of King County, Washington, granted the city's motion to dismiss. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizens argued that the mayor's executive order granting employee benefits to city employees in same-sex marriages redefined marriage and violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.04.010 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.04.020 of Washington's Defense of Marriage Act. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the order neither conflicted with these statutes nor otherwise invaded a field preempted by a state statute; the citizens failed to show the state had preempted the field of employee benefits for the city. To the contrary, that field remained a matter of local concern in which the city exercised broad discretion. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.04.180 gave the city authority to provide benefits to employees and their dependents. Thus, the mayor was fully within his right to issue an executive order directing the provision of employee benefits to employees of the city. Moreover, the executive order extending benefits to city employees in same-sex marriages in the same manner as other city employees determined who was eligible for employee benefits. Nowhere did the order purport to give legal effect to same-sex marriages. And there was nothing in the order that conflicted with the Act.</SPAN></P>

The owners challenged an order awarding partial summary judgment to the DOT and holding that the Washington Highway Access Management Act (HAMA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 47.50, did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOT proposed a safety improvement project along part of a highway. The owners had access connections to the highway that the DOT intended to modify.

I, &sect;&nbsp;16 by allowing local governments to take property rights without just compensation. The trial court granted the DOT's partial summary judgment motion, ruling that Wash. Rev. Code ch. 47.50 did not violate the state constitution. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly determined that the HAMA did not facially violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Because the owners did not have a right to park in the public right of way, the elimination of on-street parking did not give rise to a takings claim. Because the privilege to park in the public right of way was not a compensable property right, it was not part of the &quot;reasonable access&quot; guaranteed by the Washington Constitution and the HAMA.

On appeal, the court held that substantial evidence supported the decision that the father was not unfit and that placing the child with him would not result in an actual detriment to the child's growth and development. There was no evidence establishing that the father was unfit or incapable of caring for the child, as the adoptive parents did not support their allegation that he used drugs with any evidence, and although the child's mother alleged that the father raped and the child was the result of that rape, the father was never charged with rape, a restraining order was not granted due to lack of evidence, and the guardian ad litem did not find the rape allegation credible enough to give it much weight.

Subsequent risk assessments conducted however, placed the petitioner in risk category RM-B, rendering him ineligible. The appellate court ruled that the petitioner's due process rights were violated because he was not given notice or an opportunity to challenge the DOC's decision to change his risk assessment category to make him ineligible for 50 percent earned early release. There was nothing in the limited record before the appellate court to indicate that the petitioner was given notice of the reasons behind the DOC's decision to change his classification from RM-C to RM-B, making him ineligible for 50 percent earned early release, or that he had an opportunity to challenge the facts relied upon by the DOC to reach its decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erroneously found him competent to stand trial because no developmental disability expert had tested him. The court of appeals disagreed. No one, including defense counsel and defendant himself, advised the trial court of any concerns that defendant might have developmental disabilities.  Moreover, during defendant's initial evaluation, none of the examining professionals noticed any reason to find defendant developmentally disabled. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.77.090(1)(c) did not specify who must perform the developmental disability evaluation or how the evaluation should have been conducted. Nor did &sect; 10.77.090(1)(c) require the trial court to make a specific finding about the presence or absence of a developmental disability in connection with determining defendant's competency to stand trial. Furthermore, none of the three experts, not even defendant's, opined that defendant was developmentally disabled. Although no one performed a formal IQ test, all three experts placed defendant's IQ above 70 and, thus, outside the IQ range for mental retardation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree child rape and two counts of first degree child molestation for the rape of his daughter. The Washington trial court sentenced defendant under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712 to a high-end minimum term, and sentenced defendant to community custody for life following release from confinement and imposed a variety of conditions, some statutory, some discretionary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no evidence in the record that alcohol or drugs contributed to the crimes committed by defendant. The State asserted that it was reasonable to impose these conditions to enhance community safety by preventing the perpetrator from purchasing or possessing alcohol and to submit to substance abuse treatment or counseling. The appellate court found that these assertions were not supported by the evidence. The allegations of alcohol and drug use were not shown to have contributed to the crimes committed and therefore the imposition of these conditions exceeded the sentencing court's authority. Also, the condition requiring the affirmative conduct or treatment for substance abuse must be stricken, and there was no evidence in the case that the Internet contributed to defendant's offenses. Furthermore, the appellate court rejected defendant's claim that the condition prohibiting possession of pornography was overbroad. Defendant could not show that the pornography prohibition was impermissibly vague in all applications because there were some materials that any reasonable person would understand to constitute pornography. On its face, the proscription was not ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conditions imposed regarding substance abuse treatment, the purchase or possession of alcohol (not alcohol consumption), and access to the Internet were reversed and the case remanded to strike those conditions, and the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court found the accused to be incompetent to stand trial, the State dismissed its information, and the accused was not convicted.

Code &sect; 43.20B.330 and concluded that the costs relating to the accused's competency evaluation and treatment were expenses specially incurred by the State in prosecuting him. As such, for the Department to recover those costs, if at all, it had to seek reimbursement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.160, not Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.77.250 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.20B.330, but because the accused was never a convicted defendant, the Department had no statutory authority under &sect; 10.01.160 to require him to pay the costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted before the trial court (Washington) of three counts of vehicular assault and one count of bail jumping. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing, the State argued that defendant's three prior misdemeanors did not wash out defendant's offender score under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.525(2), because defendant had been convicted of two misdemeanor offenses in 1996, and one misdemeanor offense in 2001, and was, therefore, not conviction-free for the required five-year period. On appeal, defendant argued that his offender scores were incorrect. The primary issue was whether the trial court erred by considering three misdemeanor offenses that interrupted the five-year wash-out period when the State's proof of the misdemeanor offenses was silent as to whether defendant was represented by counsel. Nevertheless, defendant's prior misdemeanor convictions were facially valid. Defendant did not attempt to challenge their validity prior to sentencing. Defendant's argument that the trial court had to presume constitutional invalidity because the State's proof did not affirmatively demonstrate constitutional validity had no merit. The State was entitled to rely on the proof of a defendant's prior conviction at sentencing until the prior conviction was corrected or vacated or unless the conviction was facially invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents appealed the trial court's termination of their parental rights, but the appellate court affirmed. Although the no-contact order was entered in a cause completely independent and separate from the termination case, under Wash. R. Evid. 201 the trial court was permitted to take judicial notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute and capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy could not have been reasonably questioned. Both parents testified at trial as to the existence of the no-contact order. The only issue concerned the dates that order was in effect. That was capable of accurate and ready determination via the court system database. Thus, the trial court did not err by taking judicial notice of the terms of the no-contact order. Additionally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 13.34.180 and 13.34.190 were constitutional. The mother was offered adequate services by the Department and there was evidence to support the finding under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.180(1)(e) that there was little likelihood that conditions would be remedied so that the children could return to her in the near future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sued respondents, a city, a collection agency, and others, claiming that the fines imposed under the city's building and structures code were excessive, unconstitutional, and outside the city's statutory authority. The Washington trial court granted summary judgment to the city. The owner challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The procedural requirement of the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA) applied as the imposition of fines to enforce city ordinances was a land use decision under Wash. Rev Code. &sect; 36.70C.020(1)(c). The notice of violation and penalties were final determinations under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.020(1) as the hearing officer had the highest level of authority to make determinations and thus, his decisions were final. The owner's argument that the city was required to enforce the ordinance in a court of limited jurisdiction was not considered where he had offered no legal authority for the argument. Even if it were considered, the argument lacked merit as the owner had raised claims based on the state and federal constitutions. Under case law, those claims were subject to superior court jurisdiction. The owner's initial request for monetary damages did not bar LUPA's application as the trial court had dismissed all damage claims. Thus, the only claims relevant to the trial court's order and the appeal were for declaratory and injunctive relief. Since the owner had not filed a land use petition or exhausted his administrative remedies, his claims were barred by LUPA.</SPAN></P>

The only evidence indicating a different means of tampering was the conversation where his grandmother asked the victim to change his story, but that conversation illustrated only her crime, not defendant's. Although the evidence was insufficient evidence to establish that defendant sought to induce the victim to testify falsely or unlawfully withhold testimony, defendant's conviction for witness tampering was based on an alternative means of committing the offense - inducing the victim to disappear. Also, substantial evidence supported that alternative. Thus, defendant was not denied his right to jury unanimity. Also, the standard sentence range was the same whether defendant's offender score was nine or 11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a workers' compensation action, appellant, the Washington Department of Labor and Industries, sought review of an order from the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington), which awarded summary judgment to respondent employee and vacated the Department's order demanding $ 13,908 from the employee's settlement with a third-party tortfeasor. The employee requested attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.52.130.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee injured his back at work. While he was receiving treatment for the back injury, he was involved in a motor vehicle collision, unrelated to his employment. He sued the driver who caused the vehicle accident. The employee settled the lawsuit. The Department demanded that the employee pay reimbursement. The Washington Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals found that the Department had a right to reimbursement for payments attributable to the motor vehicle accident. The trial court, however, awarded summary judgment to the employee. On appeal, the court found that the evidence did not establish the reimbursement claim. The Department failed to provide substantial evidence that the third party was responsible for the benefits the employee received. Although two medical experts concluded that the car accident aggravated the employee's industrial injury, neither could say that he required additional treatment or recuperation as a consequence of the car accident. Thus, the Department did not show that the car accident caused it to make expenditures under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.060(1)(c). Absent such a showing, sufficient evidence did not support its reimbursement demand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court granted the employee's request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Bellevue, Wash., City Code &sect; 10A.36.010 made unlawful &quot;any act and word or threat&quot; that intentionally placed another person in fear or apprehension of bodily injury. Subjecting the ordinance to overbreadth analysis under federal constitutional law, the court concluded that: (1) the ordinance proscribed protected speech because it did not prohibit only &quot;true threats,&quot; that is, statements reasonably interpreted as a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm; but (2) the ordinance did not make unlawful a real and substantial amount of protected speech because it was directed against specific conduct, namely, acting with the intent to place a person in fear or apprehension of bodily injury; and (3) the ordinance could be saved by a sufficient limiting construction because its specific intent requirement allowed it to be construed as prohibiting only true threats. Thus, the ordinance was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jury instructions were erroneous, his counsel was ineffective, and the trial court failed to properly determine his criminal history. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by instructing the jury without defining the &quot;reckless manner&quot; standard of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024(1) and instead instructed the jury using the &quot;willful or wanton&quot; standard of former &sect; 46.61.024(1). The appellate court noted that &quot;reckless&quot; conduct was established by proof of &quot;willful or wanton&quot; conduct. The erroneous instruction was harmless error. The trial court did not err in giving instruction number 9 as the inferred fact of driving in a reckless manner flowed from the evidence or excessive speed. Although counsel failed to object to the erroneous instructions, because &quot;reckless manner&quot; was subsumed within the higher standard of &quot;willful or wanton&quot; conduct, a proper instruction would not have changed the trial's outcome. The trial court erred by relying on only the Statement of Prosecuting Attorney to determine defendant's criminal history and to calculate his offender score as it was insufficient and defendant's failure to object did not constitute an acknowledgement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for touching and asking the two victims, who were younger than 18 years old, to have sex with him. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions because: (1) the first victim testified that defendant began to talk about sex about a week after he began touching her; (2) the first victim told both the police and an interviewer at the sexual assault center that defendant asked her to have sex at least twice; (3) the second victim heard defendant ask the first victim for sex; and (4) the second victim testified that defendant well talked about sex with her and asked her to have sex with him on several occasions. Defendant waived his right to argue that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he was convicted of a felony sex offense prior to May 15, 2005 because he stipulated that he had a previous third-degree child molestation conviction. However, the court remanded to the case to correct defendant's sentence, because his total sentence of nine years and eight months in prison and 60 months of community custody exceeded the 10-year maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a sexually violent predator (SVP) commitment petition and a certification for determination of probable cause under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender argued that he had been wrongly deprived of counsel during his pre-petition SVP evaluation. However, the appellate court held that he had no constitutional right to counsel during such an evaluation; also, his Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege had not been violated during the evaluation interview because he had not been compelled to answer any of the State's queries, and thus the interview was not an &quot;interrogation&quot; for Fifth Amendment purposes. The offender argued that his attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the evaluation procedure or dispute the voluntariness of his statements, but the appellate court noted that the offender had acquiesced in the procedure and signed a consent form. The offender requested a new trial because the trial court, due to a taping error, had not preserved a witness's testimony in a verbatim report. However, the appellate court noted that he had no due process right to such a report, there was no showing that the witness's deposition and a reconstructed narrative record would not have allowed effective appellate review, and the offender had made no attempt to supplement the record with affidavits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent challenged the order revoking his Washington insurance agent's license, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that substantial evidence supported the review judge's decision under the statutory duty of care found in Wash.

Lead cards sent out confused some customers who though that they were sent by the county assessor's office and the review judge's conclusion that the use of the cards was misleading and deceptive was supported by substantial evidence, including calls to the assessor's office and the attorney general. Additionally, his application had asked whether he had any complaints filed against him and the agent should have answered yes under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.17.090(3) since he had received a written notice of a complaint from the California Insurance Department to which he responded. The appellate court did not need to decide whether the review judge properly adopted a heightened standard of care because substantial evidence supported her decision under the statutory duty of care set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.01.030.</SPAN></P>

The private property owners claimed that this exemption unconstitutionally burdened them and exceeded the city's statutory authority. However, the court held that the ordinance articulated a reasonable basis for excluding city streets from storm water charges; the declaration that city streets provided an in-kind service was neither arbitrary nor capricious nor in violation of the statute's plain language. The property owners offered no evidence, other than their own affidavit, to support the contention that the ordinance resulted in higher charges to them, and even if this contention were true, there was no showing that such an increase was either a tax or a fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington juvenile court entered an adjudication finding appellant juvenile guilty of first degree rape of a child under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.073. Appellant challenged the juvenile court's judgment, arguing that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;9A.44.073 violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of the 11-year-old victim's sexual immaturity, appellant was able to manipulate the victim to perform sexual acts with him, even after the victim initially refused. By taking away a video game and promising its return if the victim cooperated, appellant persuaded the 11-year-old victim to engage in sexual intercourse to gratify his own sexual desires. Appellant's extra two years of age provided him with more sexual knowledge than the victim and some measure of power, which enabled him to obtain a younger, more acquiescent child for sexual experimentation - exactly the type of situation the legislature sought to prohibit with the strict age classifications in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.073. Accordingly, the age classifications in &sect; 9A.44.073 were not wholly unrelated to the State's legitimate interest in protecting immature children from sexual intercourse with persons more than two years older. Therefore, the statute did not violate appellant's equal protection rights and was constitutional. Also, due process did not require a fact-based inquiry into the 11-year-old victim's ability to consent to sexual intercourse with someone who was more than 24 months older.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the juvenile court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Washington superior court convicted defendant of one count of second degree assault with sexual motivation and one count of unlawful imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence on the assault count with a minimum term of 15 months of confinement and a maximum term of life, and 12 months confinement or the unlawful imprisonment count, to be served concurrently. Community custody was also imposed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the community custody condition requiring him to abide by any additional conditions imposed by the department of corrections (DOC) exceeded the sentencing court's statutory authority; and the trial court erred in entering judgment and imposing sentence for unlawful imprisonment because it concluded that the two counts merged. The appellate court disagreed, holding first that unless and until the DOC imposed conditions beyond its authority, defendant's challenge to his community custody conditions was premature. The trial court also properly sentenced defendant on the unlawful imprisonment count, and there was no violation of double jeopardy in doing so. The compelled collection of DNA from defendant without a warrant pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 was not unconstitutional as the state supreme court had recently upheld a similar complaint on the issue. Contrary to defendant's assertion, he was properly sentenced under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712(1)(a)(ii) because he was convicted of assault in the second degree with a finding of sexual motivation, and Subsection (b) of that statute applied to prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which found in favor of respondent, the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS), and terminated the mother's parental rights to her son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother appealed the termination of her parental rights to her son, primarily contending that because her visitation rights were limited, the DSHS did not meet its burden to show that it provided all services capable of correcting parental deficiencies. The appellate court concluded that although visitation was an important right of the family, it was not, on its own, a service that was required to be provided under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.180(1)(d). Because substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings that the DSHS met its burden to prove the statutory elements required for entry of a termination order, the appellate court affirmed the termination of the mother's parental rights. The district court properly restricted visitation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.136(1)(b)(ii) in order to prevent harm to the child. And, the parenting deficiencies identified originally, including her lack of insight into how her behavior affected her child, were still present at the termination trial. Thus, the DSHS had established that the conditions of the parent-child relationship were not likely to be remedied in the near future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with robbing two jewelry stores. A jury before the trial court (Washington) convicted defendant of attempted first degree robbery, first degree kidnapping, first degree assault, first degree robbery, and unlawful possession of a firearm. Six of the charges carried a firearm enhancement. Defendant was sentenced to 800 months' incarceration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pointing a gun at a jewelry store's owner, defendant forced the owner to lie on the floor. Defendant then began to take jewelry. The owner broke free, and gunshots were exchanged. Defendant later entered a second store on false pretenses. Defendant eventually fled with jewelry. The State conceded that because attempted robbery was a class B felony, he should have received only a 36-month firearm enhancement on that charge. The evidence was sufficient to show that defendant was armed with a firearm in the second robbery, based on eyewitness testimony. Defendant's convictions for assault and robbery did not merge because proof of the assault was not necessary to prove first degree robbery. On the issue of whether jury instructions were properly given, the trial court did not err in defining kidnapping to the jury based on &quot;restraint.&quot; The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for kidnapping. Before trial, defendant challenged fingerprint identification, claiming that the trial court did not analyzing his supporting material. The trial court correctly concluded that the accepted methodology for identifying people was through the use of fingerprints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing based on the issues properly conceded by the State. On all other issues, the appellate court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to a second degree rape of a child charge in exchange for a special sex offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) recommendation from the State. The SSOSA entered by the Superior Court for Benton County (Washington) contained numerous conditions of probation one of which prohibited defendant from perusing &quot;any pornographic material.&quot; Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the community custody condition that prohibited the possession of &quot;any pornographic material,&quot; claiming that the condition was unconstitutionally vague and had been held to have been unconstitutionally vague in State v. Sansone. The instant condition specifically provided: &quot;Do not possess or peruse pornographic materials, including those found on the internet.&quot; After defendant served his sentence, he would be back on community supervision. He should not have to be placed in the risky position of waiting until he was arrested on a probation violation to discover what materials his CCO or the court considered pornographic. To avoid that hardship, and because the issue implicated defendant's due process rights, the appellate court addressed his challenge to the pornography prohibition. The prohibition was essentially identical to those found void for vagueness in other cases. As in those cases, once defendant was on probation, he would not know what conduct he had to avoid to protect against arbitrary enforcement. That lack of ascertainable standards violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court to provide a more specific definition of the prohibition consistent with defendant's treatment status and goals and a condition consistent with State v. Sansone. The trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed the 84-year-old victim and then demanded that the victim take him to a tavern. At sentencing, the State provided a statement of the prosecuting attorney that included a list of what the prosecutor believed was defendant's criminal history. Defendant did not object to the prosecutor's list. At sentencing, the State did not produce certified copies of any judgment or sentence showing defendant's alleged criminal history and failed to provide a reason for that omission. Also, the State relied solely on the argumentative statement of the prosecuting attorney concerning defendant's criminal history. No presentence report was submitted by the Washington Department of Corrections and the prosecutor's statement did not constitute a presentence report under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.500. Thus, the State failed to prove defendant's criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence or that defendant waived any challenge to the criminal history. Therefore, the trial court lacked the statutory authority to calculate defendant's offender score based on convictions the State failed to prove. Accordingly, defendant's sentence, based upon an incorrect offender score, was defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington)&nbsp;of attempted first degree murder (domestic violence), a violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court imposed a 25-year exceptional sentence. Defendant appealed claiming prosecutorial misconduct and that his exceptional sentence violated constitutional protections and had no statutory basis. Inter alia, defendant argued that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument when she argued facts not in evidence to support her theory that he was obsessed with the victim and that that obsession fed his anger until he acted on it. The appellate court found no prejudicial misconduct. The record amply supported an inference that defendant was obsessed with the victim, could not understand or accept her rejection of him, and that that anger seethed in him until he broke into her house in the middle of the night and tried to choke her to death. Further, the court instructed the jury not to consider counsel's arguments as evidence, to disregard any statements the evidence did not support, and to follow the court's instructions. Further, defense counsel's failure to object to those statements would have served no legitimate tactical basis. In fact, defense counsel used the same argument to persuade the jury that defendant only intended to hurt the victim not kill her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retailer sued respondents, a tribe, the State of Washington, the Washington Department of Revenue (WDOR), and others, challenging the legality of a cigarette sales tax agreement. The Thurston Superior Court (Washington) dismissed the tribe as a defendant due to its sovereign immunity and dismissed the complaint for lack of an indispensable party. The retailer appealed. The tribe requested attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tribe and the WDOR entered into an agreement regulating imposition of taxes on cigarette sales in Indian country. The retailer, a tribal member, sought injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and damages. The appellate court determined that the trial court properly dismissed the tribe based on sovereign immunity because (1) the retailer sought equitable relief and damages, not just prospective relief, and (2) the tribe did not waive its sovereign immunity by entering into the agreement. The trial court did not err in finding that the tribe was an indispensable party, because, inter alia, (1) the tribe was necessary for just adjudication since a judgment rendered in the tribe's absence would greatly prejudice the tribe because the agreement would essentially disintegrate, (2) a remedy fashioned without the tribe would not be adequate to address the retailer's concerns, and (3) the tribal interest in immunity overcame the retailer's possible lack of an alternative remedy or forum. The tribe's request for attorney fees under Wash. R. App. P. 18.9(a) was denied because the retailer's appeal was not frivolous since he raised debatable issues on which reasonable minds would differ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed. The appellate court declined to grant the tribe's request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent pled guilty to first-degree rape of a child. The standard sentencing range was 93 to 163 months. Respondent had developmental delays. Respondent requested an exceptional sentence downward, and the State requested a sentence at the low end of the standard range. The trial court sentenced respondent to six months of confinement, an exceptional sentence below the standard range, but imposed a community custody period that was commensurate with the standard-range confinement period. The DOC petitioned that the case be remanded for resentencing. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535 authorized exceptional sentences. Further, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.545 specified that sentences of a year or less confinement could be followed by up to one year of community custody. Because community custody was authorized by statute, the trial court could impose a custody term shorter than the amount set by statute. The trial court imposed a sentence tailored to respondent's particular case. The sentence was consistent with Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 437-20-010, which set community custody ranges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree theft. A jury found two special findings that the crime involved an attempted or actual economic loss greater than that typical for the crime and a high degree of sophistication and planning. The standard range sentence for her conviction was 0-90 days. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of one year and one day based on the jury's special findings. On appeal, the court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537 proceedings did not impermissibly chill the right to trial. The statute was constitutional. Further, the trial court did not err in relying on the jury's special findings to establish major economic loss. In accordance with Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.535 and 9.94A.537, the trial court properly imposed an exceptional sentence based on the aggravating factor. Finally, the evidence sufficiently supported the conviction. The evidence showed that defendant purchased an automobile from a dealership with a known counterfeit check and received substantial cash in change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a provider of &quot;electrodermal testing&quot; (EDT), appealed a decision from the superior court (Washington), affirming the decision of appellee, the Department of Health (DOH), that she engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine as defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.71.011 and of veterinary medicine as defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.92.010. Appellant was ordered to cease and desist and was issued a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant used her EDT device to evaluate and identify medical illnesses or conditions through a client's &quot;energy signature&quot; and created a tincture based on the EDT readings and her evaluation. It was not error to conclude that she was engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and of veterinary medicine. The DOH was not required to demonstrate actual harm; Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.120.010 did not apply. The EDT device was not used for biofeedback and she was not appealing from a compensation denial for an industrial insurance claim; Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 296-21-280 did not apply. Appellant's argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.71.011 was unconstitutionally vague was without merit and she failed to show any real overbreadth of &sect; 18.71.011 when applied to her unlicensed EDT practice. Her conduct was legitimately regulated as the unlawful practice of medicine. Her claim that the DOH lacked jurisdiction over her was rejected because she was not a tribal member and the State had authority over her while she was on tribal lands. Because Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 18.71.011 and 18.120.010 were not ambiguous, the rule of lenity did not apply. Expert testimony was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court's order to collect a DNA sample under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 did not disturb defendant's private affairs or violate his Wash. Const. art.

The court held that the biological sampling met the special needs exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court held that because the State charged defendant with a class A felony, the statutory maximum for his crime was life in prison under Wash. Rev.

The officer's testimony provided substantial support for the trial court's finding that defendant stated that he did not know if he needed a lawyer. After a knowing and voluntary waiver of the Miranda rights, the officer could continue questioning unless and until defendant unequivocally requested an attorney. Because defendant's reference to an attorney was equivocal, the officer was not obligated to stop his questioning or to clarify defendant's statement.

Before encountering defendant, the cooperating witness (CW) had money, but no cocaine. The CW returned with cocaine, but no money. The CW testified that he purchased the cocaine from defendant.

Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the trial court relied on defendant's prior criminal history of failing to obey court orders and that the offense involved distributing drugs to a teenager. These facts were properly before the court and did not violate the &quot;real facts&quot; doctrine. The trial court determined that defendant was not a suitable candidate for the DOSA because he had a history of failing to comply with court orders and distributed drugs to a teenager, and the trial court believed that the program would not be effective to rehabilitate him. The trial court properly exercised its discretion. Before entering his guilty plea, the trial court informed defendant that there was no guarantee that he would receive a DOSA, and defendant responded that he understood. Defendant was properly informed that he might not receive a DOSA. The compelled collection of DNA from convicted felons under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 did not violate either the Washington Constitution or the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voters sought review of an order from a trial court (Washington), which granted a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, a county and a voting machine manufacturer, in an action for invalidation of the contract between defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the 2004 general election, the county polls used electronic voting machines. After the election, the governing regulations were amended to require that any electronic voting system produce individual paper records. The electronic voting machines could no longer be used. The voters brought an action against defendants, seeking invalidation of the contract between defendants on the ground that the confidentiality provisions violated voters' fundamental right to suffrage by preventing access to information by which voters could personally verify the accuracy of the election. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court found that the relief the voters sought, voiding the contract between defendants, would not directly redress their claimed injury. Voiding the contract would not automatically release the allegedly withheld information. It would not alter the results of the uncontested election in which the voters claimed that their votes were diluted. Because the election was over, the machines were no longer in use, and the challenged contract had been fully performed, the appeal, and the entire case, was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VII, &sect; 1. The trial court (Washington) denied the school district's motion to strike an expert's statements and dismissed the complaint on summary judgment. The school district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district challenged the city's storm and surface water utility charge under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 35.67.010, 35.67.020, and 35.67.120 on the ground that it was an unlawful tax imposed in violation of the uniformity requirement of Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1. The appellate court determined that the city was properly granted summary judgment because the charge was a permissible regulatory fee. The charge was not a tax under the Covell factors, because (1) its purpose was limited to protecting property owners and local water sources from harm caused by storm and surface water runoff, (2) the city segregated the funds and used them only for this purpose, and (3) the fee was roughly proportional to the amount of impervious surface on the property being taxed. Regarding the school district's argument that the trial court erred by admitting expert testimony on the issue of the reasonableness of the fee, any error was harmless because while the expert opinion was irrelevant to the issue before the trial court, the trial court expressly stated that it did not rely on this testimony to make its decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court (Washington) convicted defendant of first degree theft and first degree robbery.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the State presented insufficient evidence of accomplice liability and challenged the trial court's exceptional sentence in the absence of specific jury findings. The appellate court concluded there was sufficient evidence that defendant had general knowledge of the robbery and aided in the planning and commission of the offense based on evidence that defendant and his accomplice were driving around with the specific and sole purpose of looking for opportunities to steal. Defendant was not required to have specific knowledge that the victim was injured or that his accomplice intended to actually injure her, as this element merely elevated the robbery charge to first degree. Further, defendant's waiver containing an express statement that he wished to have the judge decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether an aggravating circumstance existed supported the imposition of an exceptional sentence. Moreover, defendant knowingly waived his right to a jury fact finding of any aggravating circumstances. Thus, the trial court had the statutory authority to engage in fact finding in support of an exceptional sentence based on defendant's express waiver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee lessor found during discovery that neither appellant lessee nor its predecessor obtained permits for billboards from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) as required by the Scenic Vista Act (SVA). The trial court (Washington) granted the lessor's motion for partial summary judgment dismissing the lessee's claim for damages. The trial court held that the billboards were unlawful under the SVA. The lessee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The billboards were subject to the SVA. The sign was visible from the interstate system. Failure to obtain the permit removed the lessee from any protection afforded by the SVA. Moreover, the SVA itself provided that any sign erected or maintained contrary to the provisions of the chapter or rules that was designed to be viewed from the interstate system, the primary system, or the scenic system was a public nuisance. The billboards constituted a public nuisance. Thus, the lessee's lease was subject to the notice of unlawful detainer by the lessor. The lessee argued that no action could be brought against it because it was a legal nonconforming use and the SVA required compensation be paid before requiring removal of the signs. But, in order to come under the umbrella of just compensation under the SVA, the lessee would have had to have legally erected the signs and be &quot;in compliance with existing state and local law.&quot;  Since the billboards were unlawful when erected in 1987 and were deemed to be a public nuisance until their removal in 2005, the lessee had no right to compensation for the billboards. The trial court's award of attorney fees to the lessor was not in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's summary judgment dismissal of all of the lessee's claims and the trial court's award of attorney fees were affirmed. Additionally, the lessor was entitled to attorney fees on appeal under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;4.84.330 and Wash. R. App. P. 18.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court violated his constitutional right to trial by jury by imposing an exceptional sentence based on facts to which he did not stipulate or that were not determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant pled guilty to incest charges against him and did not challenge the validity of his plea agreement. While the trial court did not engage in the judicial fact finding to support the exceptional sentence required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535, appellant stipulated to the exceptional sentence. This alone was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of substantial and compelling reasons to impose the exceptional sentence. Also, the trial court expressly stated that it would have imposed the 180-month sentence on the basis of any of the &sect; 9.94A.535 factors. Thus, the appellate court believed that the trial court would have imposed the same sentence based solely on the stipulation to the exceptional sentence recommendation, which was a valid and independent factor. Since the sentence was based on this stipulation, there was no prohibited fact finding in violation of Blakely when the trial court imposed the exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code ch. 71.05. The Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) denied the detainee's request to represent himself at trial and involuntarily committed him to a state hospital for 90 days. Respondent State dismissed its petition for 180 days commitment, and the detainee was released. The detainee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil commitment petition alleged that the detainee was &quot;gravely disabled&quot; as a result of a mental disorder. The detainee told the trial court that he wanted to represent himself. The trial court denied the request and ruled that the detainee was &quot;gravely disabled.&quot; The detainee argued that the failure to allow him to represent himself at his involuntary civil commitment hearing violated his rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The appellate court determined that the issue of the detainee's right to self-representation was not moot because the issue involved a matter of continuing and substantial public interest. Applying the criminal standard for self-representation, the appellate court determined that the right of self representation applied in the involuntary civil commitment proceeding, the detainee unequivocally asserted this right, and the trial court erred by failing to inquire about whether he understood the nature of the proceedings or any of the other factors in the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.77.020(1) guidelines before it denied his request. However, the issue was not addressed further because there was no relief that could be provided to the detainee.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant's claimed confusion was not supported by the record. The trial court found that any confusion was not objectively reasonable. The trial court found that defendant was sufficiently advised of the purpose of the interview so that it was not reasonable for defendant to be confused. The trial court also found that defendant, after having been reasonably advised of the nature of the inquiry, did not attempt to invoke his rights, which the detective told him he could do at any time. Additionally, defendant was 34 years old and the trial court commented at least once during the proceedings that defendant was intelligent and articulate. Defendant also conceded that he had been previously advised of his rights upon his several previous felony arrests. In fact, his judgment and sentence showed at least 17 prior offenses. The trial court correctly concluded that there was nothing about defendant's personal circumstances, the timing or atmosphere of the interview, or any additional facts to demonstrate that defendant's will was overborne.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 13.34.180 and 13.34.190, the statutes governing termination of the parent and child relationship. Because the termination statutes were narrowly drawn to achieve the State's compelling interest in protecting children from harm, they were constitutional. In addition, the appellate court found that the State offered the mother a wide variety of services from 1998 to 2005 in order to cure her parental deficiencies. Although the mother participated in some classes, she failed to substantially correct her parental deficiencies since the finding of dependency in 1998. Additionally, the Washington Department of Social and Health Services offered her numerous services to remedy her parental deficiencies and she continually failed to either complete the programs offered or comply with the requirements. Also, experts testified that the mother was not fit to meet her daughter's needs. Finally, the continuation of the parent-child relationship posed a risk of harm to her daughter. Thus, the trial court properly terminated the mother's parental rights to her daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Blakely rule was held to be nonretroactive, the State filed a motion pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8 to reimpose the exceptional sentence originally imposed after defendant pled guilty to first degree kidnapping and first degree burglary. The Superior Court Benton County (Washington) granted the motion. Defendant challenged the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the trial court originally vacated the sentence, it was under the impression that the Blakely rule applied retroactively to the sentencing procedures used to impose the exceptional sentence. Case law subsequently held that the Blakely rule did not apply retroactively to convictions that were final when the rule was decided. While case law regarding retroactivity existed prior to that decision, the application of those general principles to the discrete issue of whether the Blakely rule applied retroactively did not. Thus, the circumstances that were alleged to justify the relief under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(b)(5) did not exist prior to the decision regarding the Blakely rule. Although it had not provided affidavits setting forth a concise statement of the errors upon which its motion was based, the State had provided a sufficient basis to establish a mistake of law justifying relief where the only issue was a change in law and thus, it was sufficient for the State to present a signed motion outlining the legal issues, along with the relevant precedent, and accompanying legal analysis from the Washington Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.533 was a sentencing act, and was complete in itself without requiring reference to other statutes to understand its purpose and meaning, it was not rendered unconstitutional by Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37. Although Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.533 had incidental effects on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021, the second degree assault statute, it did not in any way modify the statute, even by implication. Also, sentence enhancements for offenses committed with weapons did not violate double jeopardy, even where the use of a weapon is an element of the crime. Finally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.602 authorized a special allegation and jury finding as to whether the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon. A firearm was a type of deadly weapon, and the jury returned a special verdict and found that defendant was armed with a firearm at the time the crime was committed. The procedural statute did not need amendment merely because the legislature created differing penalties for different deadly weapons.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed a SSOSA sentence subject to several conditions, including completion of a treatment program, reporting to a community correction officer, and not traveling outside the county without prior approval.

On appeal, the court found that there was no abuse of discretion in revoking the suspended sentence because defendant violated several conditions of his sentence. The trial court properly considered defendant's explanation and determined that he did not provide a valid reason for fleeing. There was no violation of defendant's due process rights since the trial court adequately stated its reasons for the sentence revocation and did not rely on improper evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence imposed by the G.H. County Superior Court (Washington) for second degree murder while armed with a deadly weapon, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.050(1)(a). The trial court sentenced defendant to 234 months confinement, with an additional 60-month firearm enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant asserted self-defense. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the information and the jury instruction, arguing that &quot;without premeditation&quot; was an element of second degree murder by intentional killing to be proven by the State. On review, the court affirmed the conviction, agreeing with the State that &quot;without premeditation&quot; was not an element of the crime under &sect; 9A.32.050(1)(a). Premeditation was the element that distinguished first degree murder under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9A.32.020 from intentional second degree murder. However, the lack of premeditation was not an additional element to be proven by the State to prove second degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that &quot;but without premeditation&quot; did not function as an essential element under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9A.32.050(1)(a), but rather, it served merely to distinguish second degree murder from first degree murder. Thus, there was no error in the information's failure to allege that defendant acted &quot;without premeditation&quot; and in the instruction's failure to include &quot;without premeditation&quot; as an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As trial was about to begin on a second degree murder charge against defendant, the trial court told defendant that the State's plea offer was &quot;in his best interests,&quot; a &quot;very good deal,&quot; and it would be a &quot;mistake&quot; and &quot;a very unwise decision&quot; to turn it down. Defendant argued that the trial court overstepped its bounds by pressuring him to plead guilty, thus rendering his plea involuntary. The State asserted that the appeal should be denied because the trial court's involvement was only to make certain that defendant understood all of the conditions of the State's offer so that his plea would be knowing and intelligent. The appellate court ruled that the volume and intensity of the advice the trial court gave to defendant did cast &quot;significant doubt&quot; on the voluntariness of the plea. The trial court told defendant that the offer was &quot;generous,&quot; in his &quot;best interests,&quot; a &quot;very good deal,&quot; and it would be a &quot;mistake&quot; to reject it. These remarks by the trial court were clearly inappropriate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The &quot;to-convict&quot; jury instructions were proper as they neither lessened the prosecution's burden of proof nor allowed the juvenile to be convicted of an uncharged crime. A unanimity instruction was not required as to whether the juvenile acted as a principal or as an accomplice. Since his arguments related to the &quot;to-convict&quot; instruction lacked merit, his trial and appellate counsel were not deficient in failing to object. The juvenile declination procedure did not violate the juvenile's right to a jury trial as the Apprendi and Blakely rules did not apply to such a hearing. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110 and the decline hearings did not violate equal protection as it was rational for the juvenile court to decline jurisdiction after determining that it was not in the best interests of the juvenile and society. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110 did not violate the self-incrimination privilege or the right to confrontation as guilt or innocence was not at issue in the hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful manufacturing of a controlled substance - methamphetamine in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii), unlawful possession of ammonia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, unlawful storage of ammonia, and unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The trial court (Washington) denied defendant's request for a drug offender sentencing alternative (DOSA) sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When officers went to defendant's residence based on two outstanding misdemeanor arrest warrants, he consented to the officers' entry, was arrested, and orally consented to a search of his residence, which revealed evidence of the manufacturing of methamphetamine. Regarding defendant's argument that the arresting officers violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.030 by neglecting to inform him that he would be shown a copy of the warrant and be allowed to post bail before he was asked for consent to search, the appellate court determined that it could not review the alleged error for the first time on appeal since he did not raise the claim at trial and he did not establish how the alleged error actually affected his trial. The search was legal because defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented after being advised of the Ferrier warnings and his consent obviated the need for a search warrant. The trial court considered and rejected a DOSA sentence, and that decision was not reviewable. Finally, any error regarding the omission of a specified controlled substance in the verdict form was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the first degree escape statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.110, was unconstitutionally vague and that the jury received insufficient evidence to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the challenged statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The statute prohibited defendant's conduct. Defendant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. Two community corrections officers testified that defendant had been arrested, handcuffed, and put in the back seat of a cage car. One of the officers testified that he inadvertently left the doors unlocked from the outside, meaning that anyone could have released defendant. Defendant disappeared from the car while the officers were not looking. Defendant did not subsequently surrender but was arrested two weeks later. Viewing this evidence and the reasonable inferences from the circumstances in the light most favorable to the State, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant escaped from custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the terms &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;open and obscene exposure&quot; in Wash. Rev.

Defendant also argued that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The phrase &quot;open and obscene exposure of his or her person&quot; in the statute provided sufficient guidance such that the public was not required to guess that the statute prohibited masturbating exposed genitals in a public place. Contrary to defendant's allegations, there was no deficiency in the charging language of the information. The amended information gave defendant specific notice of the aggravating circumstance it was alleging to support an exceptional sentence. The amended information's express citation to Wash. Rev.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in imposing an exceptional sentence based on the jury's findings that defendant committed the crime with deliberate cruelty against a particularly vulnerable victim because: (1) the Blakely fix legislation contained in 2005 Wash. Laws ch. 68 applied to defendant, as his trial began on July 5, 2005, after the legislation was enacted in April 15, 2005; (2) the trial court complied with ch. 68; and (3) defendant's trial did not begin when the trial court entertained preliminary motions, but when it empaneled a jury and opening arguments were presented. Even if the trial court erred by denying defendant's challenge to a prospective juror for cause, on the ground that the juror stated he did not believe in interracial marriage and defendant was a black man who had children with a white woman, defendant cured the error by removing the juror through a peremptory challenge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the instructor of a firearms safety certification course. Two investigators attended the course, noticed that one of defendant's rifles was automatic, and seized the rifle without an ammunition supply device. The appellate court determined that the trial court did not err in dismissing the case against defendant because defendant did not have actual or constructive possession of all necessary component parts of a machine gun since (1) the State was required by Wash. Rev.

Defendant failed to properly invoke the appellate court's jurisdiction to review his constitutional challenge because (1) he did not file a notice of appeal as required by Wash. R.

The court held that the only conclusion to draw from the statute's plain language was that the legislature intended the amendment to apply to hearings that trial courts had already ordered but had not yet held. The court held that the amended statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because although it limited what factors courts could consider in determining whether an SVP's mental or physical condition has changed, nothing limited the court's ability to weigh and to analyze actuarial risk assessments during probable cause hearings. The amended statute did not violate the committed persons' due process rights because nothing prevented an SVP from demonstrating that he either comported with his behavioral treatment or that he no longer posed a danger to society.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Allegedly the private employers intentionally misclassified the inmates' work duties to avoid paying a higher prevailing wage. The department acknowledged that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1) had been declared unconstitutional, but made no legal argument on that point. The issue of the statute's unconstitutionality was not addressed at the trial level by the parties or the court. The Washington Supreme Court had held that the work program violated the Washington State Constitution, which prohibited inmate labor to be let out by contract to private persons or companies. Thus, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1) was declared unconstitutional. Because no&nbsp;inmate work program existed prior to the enactment of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.100(1), there was no law requiring that such workers be paid the prevailing wage. The Washington Supreme Court holding applied retroactively to the inmates and barred their claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of one count of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, and one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Defendant appealed the introduction at trial of a transcript of a recording made pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.230 and argued that &sect; 9.73.230 violated the separation of powers doctrine and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A law enforcement task force conducted a controlled purchase of cocaine from defendant. One week later, defendant called the undercover detective who had purchased the cocaine from him, and arranged to meet her to sell her more cocaine. The detective was fitted with a wire to record the transaction, and did so. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied at trial. The appellate court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.230 had survived constitutional attack before. Where one party consented, recordings were not a search, and did not implicate the constitution. If no oath was required by officers or witnesses in authorizing a recording under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.230, none was required for judicial review. Additionally, the legislature plainly contemplated ensuring the veracity of probable cause findings by stipulating criminal sanctions and fines for those who might abuse the statute. Defendant also claimed that his due process rights were violated when the recording was authorized based on unsworn evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Washington Department of Labor and Industries cited appellant employer for violating two Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act regulations because an employee failed to use safety equipment while stacking shingles on a roof. The citations were upheld by the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Board, and the superior court (Washington) affirmed the Board. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fall protection rule under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 296-155-24510 was not merely a hardware requirements section. It imposed upon employers a duty to ensure that employees actually wore the safety gear. Also, the ladder rule was not limited to construction workers. It applied to workplaces where construction was performed. Further, merely providing a ladder for the employee to carry around was not enough; it had to be put in place. The inspector's testimony supported the conclusion that the two rules were violated. Additionally, the employer had eight recent fall protection violations and two recent ladder violations. The previous violations supported the view that management was on notice that stricter training was needed by all employees, not just those personally involved in known violations. Finally, the Board did not err in enhancing the penalties, as the inspector's testimony was sufficient to establish the wetness and steepness of the roof as a factor supporting the likelihood of injury, and the employer had at least eight other fall protection violations within the past three years and two other ladder violations during that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee personal representative of an estate collaterally attacked appellant city's assessment claiming that a contract exempted both a short plat and a parcel of land from an assessment. The trial court found for the representative and denied the foreclosure. The trial court also granted the representative's request for attorney fees and costs under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.185.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the representative entered into an agreement for the city to obtain an easement across the representative's parcel for construction of a sewer. The agreement contained a clause acknowledging exemption of the representative's property from assessment as part of the utility local improvement district (ULID) associated with the sewer construction. The city included the parcel but not the short plat with the home within the ULID and assessed it. The representative did not pay the full assessment on the parcel so the city foreclosed. However, based on the evidence submitted in the case, the appellate court found substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial court including the finding that the agreement did exempt the subject real property from assessment. The assessment of the parcel constituted an unconstitutional impairment of a prior contract right under both the federal and state constitutions. The improper inclusion of the parcel on the roll created a basis for a successful collateral attack on the ULID. Since the parcel was exempt from the ULID, the trial court properly dismissed the city's foreclosure action because the assessment was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for robbing two jewelry stores. During each robbery, defendant bound his victims and threatened them with a firearm. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's findings on the firearm enhancements for the first-degree robbery and kidnapping charges because two victims testified that defendant held a real gun to one victim's face. The weapons enhancements did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights. The court rejected defendant's argument that because the trial court did not provide jury instructions defining &quot;restraint&quot; the State's burden of proof was lessened because the jury was properly instructed as to the elements of first-degree kidnapping and was provided with the definition of &quot;abduct;&quot; within that definition the word &quot;restrain&quot; was a term of sufficient common understanding to allow the jury to convict defendant of kidnapping. The court further held that the robbery and assault of one victim were not the same criminal conduct under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(a) because once the victim was free of his restraints, defendant made the decision not to flee but to shoot at the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was reversed insofar as it incorrectly calculated defendant's firearm enhancements. Defendant convictions and sentence were otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court Franklin County (Washington) that civilly committed him as a sexually violent predator. Defendant's claims focused on the admission of actuarial instrument evidence, due process challenges to the sexually violent predatory statutory scheme in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.060 and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020 (2001), and the sufficiency of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly admitted a doctor's testimony concerning the actuarial instruments she used to assess defendant for future dangerousness. The court held that the experts' disagreement as to the reliability of actuarial assessments went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Next, the court held that none of defendant's due process claims had merit. Finally, the doctor testified that defendant's mental disorders impacted his ability to control his behavior. She observed that two forcible rapes like defendant committed within 30 minutes of each other was highly unusual. She testified that such conduct demonstrated serious impairment of his volitional control. Significantly, defendant committed sexual crimes within one to eight months of his release from confinement. The evidence of defendant's inability to control his behavior was sufficient for the trial court to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant had serious difficulty controlling his sexually violent behavior. The evidence was sufficient to have defendant committed as a sexually violent predator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a letter from the university's student conduct board dismissing him from the university.

Defendant argued he was denied due process of law and his conviction was based on an unconstitutional trespass order. The instant court concluded that defendant failed to exhaust all administrative remedies prior to seeking review in the superior court. The procedures established by statute and administrative rule provided for an appeal of the conduct board's decision by raising objections before the university's appeal board.

Specifically, defendant contended that no unanimity instruction was given despite the State's reliance on several acts to support a conviction. The court of appeals agreed. The State conceded that reversal was required due to the trial court's failure to give a &quot;to convict&quot; instruction on the elements of that crime. The State accused defendant of misleading a public officer at least three times: (1) when defendant identified himself with a false name; (2) when defendant told the deputy that he did not have any identification; and (3) when defendant told the deputy that the white powder in the container found on the back seat was methamphetamine. The State failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the deputy had relied upon the false name because defendant corrected himself only minutes after giving it.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had worked as a part-time custodian at a high school, argued, inter alia, that the &quot;intimate areas&quot; element of the voyeurism statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.115, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court concluded that the voyeurism statute was constitutional. The student victims all wore skirts that covered their underwear and thighs. The victims' choice of clothing put the public on notice that they intended to keep the covered areas private, and their expectation of privacy was reasonable. The testimony, and the photographs themselves, suggested that defendant went to extraordinary lengths to position himself and his camera so that he could peer up the victims' skirts. Because defendant's conduct fell squarely within the statutory prohibition, the court rejected his vagueness challenge. The court also rejected defendant's overbreadth argument. The statute could not reasonably be construed to reach a substantial amount of First Amendment activity. It prohibited only unwelcome, uninvited intrusions into a person's bodily privacy. Because the voyeurism statute did not prohibit constitutionally protected activity, it was not fatally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Instruction 14 defined first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. Instructions 16, 17, 18, and 19 each contained the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction for first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. Instruction 20 defined the mens rea of knowledge.

Instruction 7 defined first degree taking a motor vehicle without permission. Instruction 8 defined the mens rea of intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county appealed from a decision of respondent growth management hearing board invalidating certain portions of the county's comprehensive plan and development regulations. The board, acting on respondent interest group's challenge, found that the county failed to explain why its urban growth areas exceeded projected population growth, improperly designated agricultural land, and failed to create a variety of densities in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interest group had standing before the board because the legislature granted standing to a &quot;participating&quot; party at the county level and that the legislative grant of such standing did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The board had jurisdiction to consider those parts of the county's comprehensive plan that it had not revised in the mandated update, and the board did not err in finding that the county failed to give sufficient notice of its early review of part of the comprehensive plan. In addition, in reviewing the county's criteria for designating agricultural lands of long-term significance, the board correctly determined that a criterion excluding lands not currently used for agriculture violated the Growth Management Act, but it erred in concluding that predominant parcel size was an invalid criterion. In reviewing the county's urban growth areas (UGAs), the board correctly determined that, without explanation as to the rationale, the 38 percent excess land in the UGAs was too large. But in reviewing the county's rural densities, the board erred in concluding that the county's zoning designations did not provide for a variety of rural densities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the board's decision invalidating the county's current use criterion in designating farm land and the board's decision invalidating the county's urban growth area designations.

Defendant's constitutional challenge to the statute failed in light of established precedent.

Defendant failed to object during closing arguments to the prosecutor's allegedly improper comments comparing the credibility of witnesses and interjecting her own opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent ratepayers sued appellant city, alleging that the city lacked authority to charge the city utility for general fund expenses. After the city rescinded an agreement to contribute ratepayer utility funds to a transit authority and reinstated the authority's obligation to pay utility relocation costs, the trial court (Washington) dismissed the claim as moot and awarded the ratepayers attorney fees and costs. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly awarded attorney fees and costs to the ratepayers under the common fund doctrine where it had dismissed the claim regarding the transit authority as moot because the city's substitute funding agreement provided essentially all of the relief that would have been available to the ratepayers. Although the claim was dismissed as moot, the litigation had preserved and protected the $21.5 million in ratepayer funds that would have been transferred to the authority in the absence of the lawsuit. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings that the litigation conferred substantial benefits on the ratepayers and preserved the ratepayer funds where the challenged agreement clearly required the city to contribute $21.5 million to the transit authority. Moreover, a deposition demonstrated that the ratepayers' legal challenge was the primary reason for the substitute agreement. As for the ratepayers' challenge to the amount of attorney fees awarded, the case was remanded for the trial court to set forth the reasons for deviating from the 25 percent benchmark in a common fund doctrine case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in awarding attorney fees under the common fund doctrine and substantial evidence supported the order awarding attorney fees on the transit authority claim.

The board had denied the permit, pursuant to Thurston County, Wash., Sanitary Code art. IV, &sect; 21.4.5.3, because he had received waivers and setbacks. Review was had under the Land Use Petition Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.030.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner bought a waterfront lot that was only 2,850 square feet. His realtor warned him that the lot was too small for a septic tank permit and that he would not be able to build a house on it. Nonetheless, the owner applied for an OSS permit and planned to build. During the application process, he requested that he be relieved of complying with several setback and site requirements; his requests were granted, and a health officer granted him an OSS permit. However, a hearing officer reversed, and the board adopted its findings. The superior court reversed; however, it found no merit in the owner's assertions that his constitutional rights were violated, and he cross-appealed. The state appellate court reversed. Under the ordinance, the health officer had discretion to permit an OSS installation only if three criteria were met; under the third criterion, the officer had discretion to grant a permit for a lot less than the minimum land size only if the proposed system met all other requirements. However, the owner had received waivers instead of meeting certain requirements. Further, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, and the vested rights doctrine did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court agreed with the Department's interpretation of Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 296-155-24510 to mean that employers had a duty to provide a fall safety system and a duty to make certain its employees used that system because that interpretation comported with the regulation's plain language, did not render any statutory language superfluous, and furthered the goal of ensuring a safe work place. The regulation imposed a specific rather than a general duty and thus, the Department did not have to prove what steps the employer failed to take. The regulation was not unconstitutionally vague as it required an employer to provide a safety system and ensure that its employees used it. Moreover, if the employer could not prove unavoidable employee misconduct, the regulation was violated. The Department was not required to follow the civil rules of superior court and serve the employer's registered agent because serving notice on the employer's yard manager, who was in charge of safety enforcement, was a reasonable way to achieve notice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in ordering an exceptional sentence. The appellate court determined that &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(b) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant under Blakely because (1) even though he stipulated to the facts of his criminal history, he did not stipulate to the fact that the presumptive sentence was too lenient, and (2) the trial court had to make additional factual findings above and beyond the admitted facts to support the exceptional sentence. However, under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their non-parental custody petition, Wash. Rev.

The trial court denied the petition, specifically finding that the mother was a fit parent. It nevertheless granted the grandparents visitation with the child. However, the trial court could not grant a non-parent the right to visitation with a child of a fit parent without according at least some special weight to the mother's own determination of what was in the child's best interests. However, although the trial found that the mother was a fit parent, it did not accord her determination of the child's best interests any weight when it awarded visitation rights to the grandparents. Also, the trial court did not find that visitation was needed to prevent harm to the child. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion by exceeding its lawful authority and violating the mother's constitutional right to parental autonomy. Additionally, the grandparents were not granted visitation rights to the child in a prior proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee challenged a decision from respondent Washington Employment Security Department, which denied her application for unemployment benefits. The Snohomish County Superior Court (Washington) certified the case for direct review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought unemployment benefits after she voluntarily quit her job. The Department denied her application based on the fact that her quitting did not fall within the 10 &quot;good cause&quot; categories in the amended version of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.20.050. The employee petitioned for review, arguing that the bill that removed the discretionary language in &sect; 50.20.050 (2002) was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect;&nbsp;19. The case was certified for direct review. In reversing, the appellate court held that the Washington Legislature did not remedy the problem with 2ESB 6097, 58th Leg., 2d Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2003) by reenacting its provisions retroactively in 2006 in a bill with a proper title. The enacting bill, EHB 3278, 59th Leg. (Wash. 2006), did not meet the constitutional subject-in-title requirement; mere reference to the statute was insufficient. Moreover, the change to the voluntary quit criteria was a hidden effect of EHB 3278. As such, 2006 Wash. Laws ch. 12 and 2003 Wash. Laws ch. 4, &sect; 4 were unconstitutional. Finally, the employee was not entitled to attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.32.160 because the request was made for the first time in a reply brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed, and the case was remanded for a determination of whether the employee's reasons for quitting constituted good cause under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.20.050 (2002).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the legislature has manifested no intent to treat the absence of necessity as an element of the crime charged. As a result, the legislature's silence with respect to the necessity defense did not indicate a legislative intent that the State had to disprove necessity beyond a reasonable doubt but, rather, indicated acquiescence in the decisions of the judiciary on this question. Furthermore, proof of necessity did not negate the knowledge element of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm, and a crime committed out of necessity was still considered an unlawful act. As such, the trial court properly placed the burden of proving the affirmative defense of necessity, by a preponderance of the evidence, on defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of a string of robberies at fast-food restaurants. Witnesses identified him, his image was captured on video, the modus operandi of the robberies was similar, and defendant confessed to police. Defendant represented himself and was convicted of five counts of first-degree robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that the trial court made a thorough inquiry into defendant's request to proceed pro se, and that his waiver of counsel was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The trial court told defendant that his attorney was in charge of trial strategy and could decide not to present defendant's religious defense, which was not recognized under the law. Defendant subsequently took the available option of representing himself with a clear, definitive statement, &quot;I choose to represent myself then.&quot; Defendant also made clear that he had successfully represented himself in the past. The questions asked by the trial court were not all yes or no, and defendant responded intelligently and appropriately to each question posed. The colloquy was detailed, thorough, and probing, and fully apprised defendant of the required information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Washington trial court, denying his motion to withdraw his Alford plea to first degree rape, second degree rape and felony harassment, and defendant challenged the condition of community custody prohibiting him from viewing or possessing pornography as defined by his treatment provider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the colloquy, the prosecutor confirmed that defendant did not feel rushed and that defendant was not concerned about his lawyer's preparation for trial. After the trial court engaged in additional colloquy with defendant, the trial court accepted the plea as knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to withdraw his Alford plea. The appellate court ruled that defendant failed to establish prejudice, as defendant made bar assertions and did not identify what additional investigation would have changed his decision to plead guilty. Also, trial counsel's decision to delay the interviews of the two victims was a strategic decision, the failure to interview bar patrons was inconsequential, and because the non-DNA evidence connecting defendant to the rape of the two victims was overwhelming, a defense DNA expert would not have changed the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, the appellate court rejected defendant's overbreadth challenge to his community custody condition that he be prohibited from viewing or possessing pornography.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the conditions imposed on the pretrial release were not authorized by Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.2 and Wash. Crim. R. Ct. Ltd. J. 3.2 because there was no indication that the releasee would fail to appear in court. In addition, under U.S. Const. amend. V and Wash. Const. art.

After the parties agreed that the victim was incompetent to stand trial, the court permitted the vicitm's mother, grandmother, and social worker to testify about the vicitm's hearsay disclosures to them. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court erred in presuming the victim's incompetency from her age, in spite of the parties' agreement; (2) the trial court erred by failing to conduct a competency hearing and to enter the statutorily required findings of Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;5.60.050 before finding the victim unavailable to testify; and (3) therefore, the victim's hearsay allegations of defendant's sexual contact were not admissible under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.102. The error was not harmless because the court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that, without the victim's hearsay statements, a reasonable jury would have convicted defendant. The State produced no conclusive physical evidence that the victim was sexually assaulted, and without the victim's hearsay statements the State could not prove a sexual assault or that defendant was the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the State to present expert testimony that white supremacists used swastikas to show hate toward African-Americans because the expert did not testify about whether he believed that defendants had selected the victim because he was African-American, but that white supremacists used the swastika to express hate toward African-Americans.</SPAN></P>

The passenger was arrested for littering, in violation of Olympia, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 9.40.110. Upon searching the truck, the officer found cash and a controlled substance. Defendant was subsequently convicted of one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine. He was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison. On appeal, the court found that it was undisputed that the officer saw the passenger throw a can from the vehicle. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100 gave the officer the authority to lawfully arrest the passenger and search the truck incident to the arrest. Defense counsel was not ineffective for not moving to suppress the evidence of the drugs, which were properly admitted without objection. The methamphetamine that was found in defendant's truck was not the fruit of an unlawful search. Because defendant did not make a Wash. R. App. P. 12.1(b) motion, he failed to preserve his argument that the State's littering statute &quot;trumped&quot; Olympia, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 9.40.110.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that there was sufficient language in the bail jumping charge to inform defendant that he was being charged with having failed to make a court appearance of which he had knowledge. Regardless of the shortcomings in the charging document, defendant had notice of the proper knowledge requirement. The trial court's knowledge instruction did not violate defendant's right to due process. Defendant's challenge to his assault convictions were rejected.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the admission of the child's statements under the child hearsay statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120, did not violate defendant's confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 because the statements were not testimonial since the statements were not solicited and the purpose of the mother and the counselor in talking to the child was not investigative. The statements were properly admitted under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120 and the Ryan factors because, inter alia, the child had no motive to lie, the statements were consistent, and the statements were made without prompting. In addition, it was not an abuse of discretion to exclude evidence that the child's father was a sexual offender, because defendant failed to establish the required nexus since the father's criminal history alone was insufficient to establish an act or step taken towards committing these crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife officer stopped defendant's vehicle because he observed (1) the vehicle on the opening day of elk hunting season inside an elk hunting area, (2) that the occupants wore hunting clothing, and (3) that the vehicle was consistent with the type that hunters used on a poorly maintained dirt hunting road. The officer saw that the occupants possessed elk rifles in the truck-cab, and a passenger stated that they had been elk hunting. The officer smelled alcohol on defendant's breath. Defendant contended that the stop was unconstitutional because it constituted an illegal roadblock. Under Wash. R. App. Dec. Ct. Ltd. J. 9.1 and Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After convicting defendant of second degree rape and first degree burglary, the trial court (Washington) imposed an indeterminate sentence of 105 months to life for the rape and a concurrent sentence of 34 months for the burglary. Defendant was also sentenced to a lifetime of community custody under the supervision of the department of corrections. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged several conditions of his community custody, contending that the prohibitions concerning &quot;erotic material and sexual stimulus materia&quot; were overbroad and vague, in violation of his right to free speech. The appellate court found that defendant's argument failed to recognize that he was not complaining about a statute affecting the public generally, but was attempting to invoke the overbreadth doctrine to attack a condition of his own particular sentence. Defendant was shown to be egregiously unable to control himself when in a state of sexual stimulus, and an order limiting his access to sexually stimulating materials and environments related directly to that aspect of his crime. Because the conditions were crime-related, defendant's overbreadth argument was unfounded. And because defendant did not explain why his vagueness challenge required evaluation of the conditions in a factual vacuum, the appellate court declined to review it. Denial of defendant's mistrial motion did not affect the outcome as the jury demonstrated that it could put aside any improper prejudice from a prosecutor's comment by refusing to convict defendant on other charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, home builders, filed a class action lawsuit against respondent, City of Bainbridge Island, concerning payment of building permit fees. The Washington trial court found that the City's fees for building permits were reasonable and did not violate Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020. The builders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City Council adopted a resolution increasing the building permit fees. The builders challenged whether the City's fees fell within the allowed statutory exceptions to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020. The appellate court found that the burden of showing that the fees complied with a statutory exception and were reasonable rested with the City because the fees were, by statute, an exception to the general prohibition against fees on construction and development. The appellate court found that the case would need to be remanded for further proceedings allocating the burden of proof to the City. The only issue at trial was whether the City's costs and the resulting fees, were reasonable, which prevented the builders' challenge to whether the imposed fees were an allowable exception because the City was not required to show that the fee calculation was limited to the legislatively specified costs of processing applications, inspecting and reviewing plans, or preparing State Environmental Policy Act statements. Also, the trial court should have focused on evidence of costs specifically allowed in the statute to calculate the permit fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court to determine whether the City's fees were limited to those the Washington Legislature specified, and if so, reasonable in light of the statutory limitations placed on the fees the City could impose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State conceded that defendant's felony harassment conviction had to be reversed because the trial court failed to provide the jury with an instruction defining the term threat, an instruction that should have incorporated the standard for what constituted a &quot;true threat.&quot; However, the court rejected defendant's prosecutorial misconduct argument because it was not misconduct for the prosecutor to argue from facts in evidence or suggest reasonable inferences from the evidence. The prosecuting attorney's argument that defendant's version of the events was improbable was directed toward the content of defendant's contradicted testimony and did not impinge upon defendant's exercise of his right to testify and present evidence. Further, defense counsel's decision not to move for a mistrial was neither deficient performance nor prejudicial. Several of the objections defendant's trial counsel raised during the prosecuting attorney's closing argument were sustained by the trial court, and the remainder of the prosecuting attorney's argument was not improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree burglary and reversed his conviction for felony harassment.

Defendant maintained that lighted headlights were not required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.37.020 at the time of the stop. The court concluded that defendant failed to establish his representation was deficient. There was no testimony indicating that lighted headlights were not needed. Section 46.37.020 did not limit its coverage to the time period from a half hour after sunset to a half hour before sunrise. Although defendant urged the court to take judicial notice of the time of sunset on the date of arrest, Wash. R. App. P. 9.11 restricted the court's consideration of adjudicative facts not already found in the record. Defendant failed to meet the test set forth in the rule. Even if the court had taken judicial notice as requested by defendant, the time of sunset would not have been dispositive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant birth mother sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Spokane County (Washington), which granted nonparental custody to respondent foster parents under Washington's Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.27. The trial court found that the mother was not unfit but that continued placement of the child with her would detrimentally affect the child's development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Montana had first placed the child with the foster parents, but temporary investigative authority was eventually terminated when the mother fulfilled requirements of a treatment plan. The mother and child moved to Washington, after which the present action was filed by the foster parents. On review, the court found no error. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 26.27.201(1) and 26.27.021(7), although neither Washington nor Montana were the child's home state, there were significant connections with Washington. Thus, the trial court properly assumed subject matter jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. Further, the decision to retain jurisdiction was not unreasonable under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.27.261 in light of the fact that the mother lived in the state and the request for the trial court to decline jurisdiction was made a week before trial. Finally, despite the fact that the trial court stated language concerning the best interest of the child, the trial court's findings and its oral ruling clearly established that it applied the heightened actual-detriment-to-the-child standard required for determining custody between a parent and a nonparent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted first degree theft for trying to steal a vehicle. He appealed and argued that the attempt statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.020, violated the separation of powers doctrine; the jury instructions were inadequate; he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and his sentence was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.020, which defined criminal attempt, was unconstitutional because it failed to define all essential elements of the offense and therefore required the judiciary to encroach on core legislative functions. However, this claim failed because the court had already rejected this argument in a different case, and defendant provided no reason to deviate from that precedent. As to defendant's jury instruction challenges, defendant was correct that one instruction misstated the law of attempt. However, when reading the challenged jury instruction with the other instructions, the error was rendered harmless because another instruction included the missing intent element. Because the jury instructions did not mislead the jury, defendant's attorney's decision not to object to them was reasonable and did not prejudice defendant. Finally, the evidence was insufficient to prove defendant's criminal history. Defendant's generic agreement that he had been convicted of 10 unspecified prior felony convictions during his sentencing allocution was not a waiver and was insufficient to support the trial court's findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county initiated a public nuisance abatement action against appellant property owner under Kitsap County, Wash., Code &sect; 9.56, the Public Nuisances ordinance, for having inoperable vehicles on his property. The Mason County Superior Court (Washington) affirmed the county's abatement action and denied the property owner's constitutional challenges to the ordinance. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's vagueness challenge to the ordinance failed because the terms the property owner pointed to were not inherently subjective. Also, Kitsap County, Wash., Code &sect; 9.56.060(2) provided that anyone who had been subject to the summary abatement process had a right to receive a notice as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement (i.e. before the action was finalized). Thus, the summary abatement process did not violate procedural due process requirements. The ordinance did not violate substantive due process rights because Kitsap County, Wash., Code &sect; 9.56.035 required the county to use less restrictive means before proceeding with abatement unless the conditions warranting abatement imposed an immediate threat to the public, and the ordinance prohibited only vehicle lots that did not have county approval. Also, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.04.125 did not deal with public nuisances and, therefore, was not in conflict with the ordinance. Finally, the ordinance did not violate the single subject requirement of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 because all of its provisions facilitated the deterrence of abatable nuisances.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The complainant took the stand and defendant cross-examined her regarding the statements she allegedly made to the nurse. The complainant could not recall what she said to the nurse, but she did independently identify defendant as her rapist. Defendant also cross-examined the complainant about the identification. In addition, the trial court's ruling that defendant could ask an officer why he was on paid administrative leave but could not ask him whether he did in fact falsify a police report was proper. Defendant asked the officer whether he was on administrative leave, what he was charged with, and which government entity charged him. Because the only additional evidence that defendant could have elicited would have been the officer's invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the evidence's probative value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendant and the State appealed a judgment of a trial court (Washington), which, upon resentencing, imposed a firearm enhancement and determined that defendant's three kidnapping convictions merged with his robbery conviction. The trial court imposed a single, standard range sentence of 68 months plus one firearm enhancement for the robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant restrained four people at gunpoint while robbing an auto parts store. The court remanded the action after reversing defendant's life sentence. On appeal after the resentencing, the court held that first degree kidnapping, even when incidental to a first degree robbery, did not merge with a robbery conviction because proof of kidnapping was not necessary to prove first degree robbery, and proof of first degree kidnapping required only the intent to commit robbery, not the completion of robbery. The trial court's other findings that defendant produced a fully-functional, loaded nine millimeter firearm and pointed it at the four people inside the store and that defendant continued to hold one victim at gunpoint showed overwhelmingly that defendant committed the robbery using a firearm. The enhanced sentence for defendant's use of a firearm did not violate double jeopardy principles or Blakely. While a finding of ineffectiveness of counsel could in certain circumstances imply a conflict of interest, defendant affirmatively acknowledged on the record that he was satisfied with his representation and had no reservations in having the same attorney represent him at the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the imposition of the firearm enhancement but reversed the convictions and remanded for resentencing on the issue of the merger of kidnapping and robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to a sex offense involving a minor. As a condition of his community custody release, the trial court required defendant to obtain the explicit consent of every sex partner, as well as the approval of his therapist and community corrections officer, prior to his engaging in future sexual activity. Defendant appealed, contending that these restrictions were not reasonably related to the crime under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(12) (2003) (now codified at &sect; 9.94A.030(13), In affirming, the appellate court held that the condition of consent from a prospective sexual partner was reasonable, even though the condition applied to adults, because defendant had a problem recognizing consent. Next, the consent restriction did not violate the right to due process, and it was not unconstitutionally vague. A person of ordinary understanding could have recognized a violation. The fact that the precise meaning of consent was situational did not mean the prohibition was vague. Finally, the requirement for official approval was reasonably related to the offense. If it became too intrusive, defendant was permitted to seek relief via a personal restraint petition.</SPAN></P>

One attorney cross-appealed, challenging the trial court's decision to grant the client's motion to file a second amended complaint against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client hired the first attorney to sue the city for damages allegedly caused by the city's misrepresentations and breach of a property exchange agreement. The first attorney failed to file a pre-suit claim for damages with the city as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96, and the client's lawsuits against the city were dismissed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the client's legal malpractice action against the first attorney because it was barred by three-year statute of limitations of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.080(3). The client knew in 1997, when it received a letter from the second attorney, that a pre-suit tort claim for damages was mandatory, that there was no evidence that a claim was filed, and that the city could successfully seek dismissal for failure to file the claim, but the client did not file its legal malpractice action until 2002. However, the trial court erred by dismissing the client's action against the second attorney because there were material issues of fact about when the client knew or should have known about the discrepancy between the property exchange and the city ordinance imposing an easement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Visitation between the parents and their children was suspended in 2002 after an altercation between the father and a security guard during a scheduled visit in the presence of one of the children. On appeal, the court held that the juvenile court misapplied Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.136(1)(b)(ii) (2004) by denying the parents visitation as a sanction and without a showing of actual harm. The DSHS had made no attempts to reunite the family. A doctor's anger management evaluations that the State relied on to support the suspension of visitation did not address how the parents' anger management issues or clinical profiles would pose a risk to their children in the context of a supervised visit. One incident, nearly five years ago, was an insufficient basis to deny all visitation between the parents and their young children. The court also reversed the juvenile court's order prohibiting the father from disseminating any information without permission and notice because the record did not contain a sufficient basis to support such a broad restriction on the father's speech.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trial court erred by imposing community custody conditions requiring them to obtain explicit consent before sexual contact and prior approval from their therapist and Community Corrections Officer. The appellate court found that the &quot;explicit consent&quot; requirement was reasonably crime-related. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding this condition reasonably necessary to accomplish the State's purpose of protecting the public. The issue of the victim's consent would be decided beyond a reasonable doubt. The offender's freedom of choosing even adult sexual partners was reasonably related to their crimes because potential romantic partners may be responsible for the safety of live-in or visiting minors. The trial court did not err in reasoning that one defendant's victim's mother was unable to protect her daughter and denying defendant's Special Sexual Offender Sentencing Alternative (SSOSA) request where defendant was marginally qualified for a SSOSA and the mother failed to protect her daughter for two years. Defendant's issue concerning a community custody condition was not ripe for review as a search had not taken place.</SPAN></P>

Appellant nonprofit organization filed a land use appeal, seeking a declaratory judgment that the agreement was unenforceable. The Superior Court, Yakima County (Washington), dismissed the action, finding the organization's appeal was time-barred by Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70C. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 20, 2001, the city council authorized and approved the agreement. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.040(4)(b), that was the date the appeal period began. The organization did not file its petition for review of the land use decision and complaint for declaratory judgment until September 6, 2002. The petition was untimely. At the latest, the organization had actual notice of the agreement on April 15, 2002. It nonetheless failed to file an appeal within 21 days of that date. Also, the organization's due process argument against the rezoning failed because notice informed the public that the purpose of a public meeting was to consider the recommendation on the rezone, there were comments on the city council's proposed changes, and the council's changes did not materially alter the impact of the rezone as recommended by the hearing examiner. There was no evidence the agreement predetermined the outcome of the rezone or that the rezone was arbitrary and unreasonable. The evidence established the rezone was for the general welfare of the community and that evidence was independent of the agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispositive question was whether the rationale of a prior case adopting the merger rule that assault could not be the predicate crime for felony murder applied to second degree felony murder crimes predicated on assault under former &sect; 9.48.040(2) (1909). The court dismissed petitioner's application for relief as untimely under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1) in that no exception to the one-year time bar applied. The court concluded that based upon the language of the amended information, the guilty plea statement, the judgment, and the sentence documents, petitioner was charged and convicted solely of second degree felony murder predicated upon assault. However, his judgment and sentence evinced no facial invalidity, and petitioner thus showed no constitutional error. The prior case adopted the merger rule for a conviction under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.050; however, the state supreme court had repeatedly rejected the merger rule as applied to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.48.040(2), the statute under which petitioner was convicted. There was a clear legislative intent that second degree felony murder under &sect; 9.48.040(2) could be predicated upon assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners agreed to purchase property, contingent on the availability of building permits. The county issued three of four permits. The owners closed on the property. The county later denied a permit for their residence and revoked the permits for the garage, shop, and septic system. The county subsequently agreed to reinstate the revoked permits and grant a single-family residence permit. The county later denied the single-family residence permit. The county left the permits for the garage, shop, and septic system intact. The owners brought an action, seeking issuance of the permits on theories of contract and estoppel. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the owners, ordering the county to issue the permits. On appeal, the court found that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that a deal was made and the owners, at least, performed. Whatever public policy the county's interpretive uncertainties might express, it could not trump the county's obligation to honor its settlement with the owners. The trial court properly determined that the county acted arbitrarily and capriciously and that the owners were entitled to damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40.020.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code ch. 42.17.13, as applied to them, did not pass strict scrutiny as a restriction on their First Amendment free speech rights and that the statute as applied was arbitrary and capricious and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers were fined by the commission for using school facilities in violation of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 42.17.130's prohibition on the use of public resources for political advocacy. The court began its First Amendment analysis by noting that school internal mail or computer systems were not traditionally forums for public communication, and there was no evidence that the high school opened either its mailbox or computer system to the public. Thus, the school's internal mail and computer systems were nonpublic forums. Because these forums are nonpublic, the court had to determine whether the regulation on their use was reasonable in light of their purpose and viewpoint neutral. The court concluded that the commission's interpretation of ch. 42.17.130 - restricting the use of the internal school mailboxes and the e-mail system - was reasonable and viewpoint-neutral. Furthermore, pure political speech was permitted, but using the facilities to deliver speech was prohibited. This distinction was rational and reasonable in light of ch. 42.17.130's policy goals of ensuring that public facilities were used for their intended purposes and in maintaining the state's political neutrality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, two minors testified that defendant repeatedly had oral sex with them and would touch their breasts and bottoms on multiple occasions. The court admitted into evidence defendant's taped confession and allowed the State to play it for the jury. Defendant denied the allegations and argued that his confession was coerced and false. The State proposed and the court gave the unanimity instruction that was at issue in the instant case. Defendant claimed that the unanimity instruction given failed to make manifestly clear that the jury had to be unanimous as to the act that served as a basis for conviction. Jury instructions had to more than adequately convey the law. They had to make the relevant legal standard manifestly apparent to the average juror. In the present case, the unanimity instruction given to the jury arguably did not meet this standard. But the instant court was bound by precedent from the state supreme court that expressly approved the unanimity instruction given. Accordingly, defendant's argument that the instruction failed to protect his constitutional right to a unanimous jury failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police received a call from an anonymous informant, who reported that a vehicle prowl was in progress. The informant identified the vehicle's make and color. When the officers arrived, defendant and another individual were walking near the vehicle described by the informant. The officers stopped defendant and his friend and did a pat down search of defendant. The search revealed a pipe used to smoke methamphetamine and a credit card in the name of another person. The appellate court found that the record was devoid of any evidence to establish the reliability of the informant and the informant did not include any noninnocuous details of the alleged vehicle prowl. Therefore, the informant was not reliable and the information the informant provided could not provide the basis for a suspicion of criminal activity. Furthermore, defendant fully cooperated with the officers and was not threatening or dangerous. Since the pat down search that recovered the methamphetamine pipe was illegal, the evidence obtained during the pat down had to be suppressed. Therefore, there was no evidence to support defendant's arrest and the arrest was also unjustified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the denial of the suppression motion and suppressed all evidence obtained during the search, both the methamphetamine pipe and the evidence of identify theft.

The trial court (Washington) imposed an exceptional sentence upward, sentencing appellant to 60 months: 48 months based on the presumptive range and six months for each of the two aggravating circumstances the jury found.

The jury found appellant guilty of second degree assault of a child and concluded that facts supported two aggravating circumstances, abuse of trust and particular vulnerability. The appellate court determined that sufficient evidence, based on the victim's testimony and medical testimony, showed that appellant assaulted the victim in the past in a manner that either resulted in bodily harm greater than transient pain or minor temporary marks or caused her physical pain equivalent to torture under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.130(1)(b). The trial court did not err in applying Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.535 and 9.94A.537 at sentencing, because the saving clause statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.040, did not apply since, inter alia, (1) Blakely did not declare Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535 facially unconstitutional, and (2) &sect; 9.94A.535 only altered the procedure, not appellant's substantive rights, as appellant was eligible for the exceptional sentence before and after the amendment of &sect; 9.94A.535.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owned a cable transmission network. In additions to providing cable television, the company also provided high-speed Internet connection. The city imposed a telephone utility tax on entities that engaged in the business of transmitting data over a network in the city. The company asserted that the tax was illegal under Washington's Internet Tax Moratorium and the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA). The appellate court found that the tax was not barred by Washington's Internet Tax Moratorium because the moratorium did not preclude the city from taxing revenue from data transmission activity via a cable transmission system. Network telephone services, which were taxed by the city as &quot;telephone business&quot;, were not subject to Washington's Internet Tax Moratorium. The city's tax was exempt under the ITFA's grandfather clause because the tax was authorized by statute before October 1, 1998, the company had notice that the city taxed its data transmission activities before October 1, 1998, and the city generally collected the tax prior to October 1, 1998. The tax was not discriminatory because it applied uniformly to companies engaged in the telephone business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A married couple were fighting after a day of drinking. The wife called police to let her in the house after defendant locked her out. After letting her in a door with a landlord's key, the officer heard a gunshot. The wife first stated that she had fired the gun, but then contended that defendant had done so. Police then obtained a search warrant authorizing the seizure of &quot;certain evidence of a crime, to-wit: &quot;assault 2nd DV.&quot; An affidavit described the incident and established probable cause to search for a gun, bullets, and other evidence relating to the shooting. Defendant's motion to suppress this evidence was denied, and he sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the warrant violated the particularity clause of the Fourth Amendment. The items could have been stated with more particularity since this was done in the affidavit, and the affidavit was irrelevant since it was not incorporated by reference. Moreover, the general reference to evidence of domestic violence was insufficient because it authorized the seizure of items for which there was no probable cause. Finally, the warrant did not authorize the search just for illicit items.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505(8), the trial judge prohibited defendant, as part of her sentence, from working as a caretaker for elderly or disabled individuals. Defendant appealed her sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial judge had no authority to prohibit her from working as a caretaker for elderly or disabled individuals. The court concluded that &sect; 9.94A.505(8) authorized the trial judge to impose crime-related prohibitions as part of any sentence. Gaining the trust of a dependent person by offering services was an intrinsic part of defendant's criminal method. The trial judge acted within her discretion in prohibiting defendant from using that method to find new victims. Working as a caretaker for dependent persons would have provided many opportunities for similar violations of trust. Therefore, the prohibition was directly related to defendant's crime. Although it was unnecessary to support the prohibition, the record indicated that the victim was disabled, at least to some extent. The victim admitted signing documents without knowing what they were for. The record amply supported the prohibition imposed by the trial judge. The prohibition was not vague. The trial judge did not prohibit defendant from caring for children. Defendant was well able to predict the prohibition's application with adequate certainty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, worship center and developers, challenged a judgment of the trial court (Washington) that dismissed their breach of contract claim against defendants congregation member and his wife; and that awarded defendants damages caused by the lis pendens under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.28.328(3) and attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.330 and a real estate purchase and sale agreement (REPSA) attorney fee provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A congregation member provided a loan to the worship center in a sales agreement (SA), by which the center would transfer title to property to the member but retain an option to repurchase it. The developers claimed that they were the assignees of the repurchase option. A RESPA was later executed that did not mention the repurchase option. A suit was filed after the repurchase deadline passed and the member refused to sell the property to the center for the SA price. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' claims, holding that the SA was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds and that it had merged into the deed. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the REPSA was fully integrated without reference to the repurchase option and that the center knowingly conveyed all title and interest by the deed. The court found that the member was entitled to damages and attorney fees under the lis pendens statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.28.328(3), because the center had no substantial justification for filing the lis pendens. However, the court reversed the fee award under the REPSA provision because that provision had merged into the deed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court judgment that awarded defendants attorney fees under the RESPA provision, but affirmed the portion of the judgment dismissing plaintiffs' contract claims and awarding defendants damages and attorney fees for the improper lis pendens. The court remanded the case to the trial court to calculate fees and costs under the lis pendens statute. The court granted defendants attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified that she did not know that any items associated with manufacturing methamphetamine were in the car, but police found numerous items used in manufacturing methamphetamine in the back of the car. Those included muriatic acid, several valves, tubing, and pseudoephedrine tablets. An officer testified that he detected a strong chemical odor coming from the car when defendant opened the door. Although a witness claimed that he placed the bucket and jars in the car without defendant's knowledge, he testified that he knew nothing about the additional items associated with manufacture that police found in the car. The jury could have inferred that defendant knew about the methamphetamine lab in her car and that she was aiding the witness in the manufacture of methamphetamine. There was evidence that defendant went to the property in a car containing an active methamphetamine lab, and from her presence on the property where people manufactured methamphetamine, the jury could have found the essential elements of manufacturing methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an action against the treasurer after an investigation into a billing scheme using a corporate entity that concealed compensation paid to another PAC worker.

Code &sect;&sect; 42.17.080, 42.17.090, and 42.17.120, as applied to her were constitutional because the State had a substantial interest in providing information to voters that was closely related to the PDA's disclosure requirements. The court noted that while the PDA's disclosure requirements did burden political speech, after-the-fact financial reporting was far less burdensome on speech than the outright prohibition by way of spending limitations. The court also rejected the treasurer's claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the record established that the Public Disclosure Commission investigated the case, found &quot;apparent&quot; violations, and referred the case to the attorney general for prosecution in the trial court as provided in Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord challenged an order of the trial court (Washington) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee city in the landlord's action asserting that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.110(4) did not allow the city to attach 3 tax liens to its property in order to collect the unpaid gambling taxes of a tenant or that, if it did allow the city to impose such a lien, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city attached tax liens on the landlord's property based on a tenant's failure to pay gambling taxes. The landlord filed suit, and in order to sell the property, the landlord agreed to pay into the court registry proceeds from the sale equal to the amount claimed by the city under its liens. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court order. The court held that the city could not impose a lien on the landlord's property because the landlord had no beneficial interest or involvement in the underlying taxable activity. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.110(4) did not authorize the city to impose a lien on the landlord's property. The court noted that holding the landlord liable for the tax liability of a tenant would deprive the landlord of its property without hearing or due process of law as provided in Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because the landlord did not owe gambling taxes and had no beneficial interest in tenant's underlying taxable activity. The court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.270 mandated strict application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.110(4) to persons permitted to engage in gambling activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of the city and remanded the case with directions to enter judgment for the landlord and release the registry funds to it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Superior Court County (Washington), of stalking his ex-girlfriend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although specific reference to the victim's fear of injury was missing from the information, that element was implied by the allegation that she was intimidated, that defendant intended to frighten her, and that he knew or reasonably should have known that she was afraid. Because fear of injury was reasonably implied in the charging language, and defendant made no further argument that the inartful language prejudiced his defense, the charging document was adequate. Also, the jury was properly instructed, and defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge the information, the jury instructions, or the prosecutor's cross-examination of defendant on prior crimes of dishonesty. The information and jury instructions were not defective, and the State was allowed to attack defendant's credibility on cross-examination by asking him about prior convictions involving dishonesty. Finally, defendant's frequent telephone calls and multiple incidents of following the victim, provided sufficient evidence for a rational juror to find that the victim reasonably feared defendant intended to injure her or another person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent arrestee on the argument that a pre-bail strip search of the arrestee, a non-violent identity-theft victim, was unconstitutional. Appellant county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the parties agreed that the county strip-searched the arrestee as a person committed to incarceration by order of a court described in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.79.120. The county argued that its strip search was authorized under the statute. The appellate court found that Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.2 implied that a person, such as the arrestee, who was taken into custody pending posting of bail, had been ordered &quot;released&quot; subject to certain conditions rather than &quot;committed to incarceration,&quot; the prerequisite for a warrantless strip search under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.79.120, not subject to the restrictions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.79.130 and .140. The legislative history demonstrated the Legislature's intent to restrict warrantless strip searches of persons, such as the arrestee, arrested for a non-violent offense, who were to be released on bail before trial or conviction. The arrestee was in custody pending release on bail and, thus, entitled to the protections of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.79.130 through .160. These protections included a warrant, probable cause, or individualized reasonable suspicion before being strip searched, none of which was present.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment in favor of the arrestee was affirmed; the superior court's ruling that the county did not violate the statutes was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a trial court (Washington), which convicted him of residential burglary, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.025(1), and four counts of first degree unlawful firearm possession, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a). He argued, and the State conceded, that the corpus delicti rule required reversal of three of his firearm convictions. Defendant also alleged, in part, ineffective assistance of counsel and a speedy trial violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State violated his Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.3 right to a speedy trial, requiring dismissal of the charges with prejudice. The court disagreed, finding that regardless of whether defendant personally agreed to the continuance, as a matter of law, he waived any objection to a continuance his counsel sought on his behalf. The court next determined that by defense counsel's express decision, in a pretrial omnibus order, to forego Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.5 and 3.6 hearings, defendant waived his right to those hearings. The court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The court accepted the State's concession as to the corpus delicti for three of the firearm counts because although the evidence was sufficient to show that someone took the firearms and that defendant committed the residential burglary, the evidence was not sufficient, independent of defendant's incriminating statements, to infer that he was the one who took and, therefore, possessed, the firearms. The evidence was sufficient, however, to prove burglary. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in calculating defendant's offender score.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions of residential burglary and one count of first degree unlawful possession of a firearm but it reversed his convictions for three other counts of first degree unlawful possession of a firearm and dismissed those counts with prejudice. The court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree assault, domestic violence, with a deadly weapon. The trial court found that he was a persistent offender under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A, and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on third-degree assault, as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.031(1)(d). Defendant had taken a serrated kitchen knife to the bedroom where he held the serrated edge to his wife's throat, placing her in apprehension of bodily injury. No evidence pointed to defendant acting with criminal negligence rather than with intent when he held the knife to his wife's throat. Further, the trial court did not err in admitting transcripts of defendant's telephone calls to his wife. The jail recorded all inmate telephone calls out; an automated message advised the inmate that the jail would record the calls. A similar message greeted those who received the telephone calls. Thus, there was no violation of the Washington Privacy Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.030(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the Board did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the MOU.

The appellate court found that in the MOU, the county agreed to provide water to the subject land. In the comprehensive plan, the county agreed not to provide water at a level inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. The Tribe proposed to use the land in a manner inconsistent with the current land use designation for the subject land. The MOU superseded and amended the comprehensive plan. Because the MOU had the legal effect of amending the plan, it was a de facto amendment and the Board had jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not establish probable cause because it did not demonstrate an informant's credibility. The lack of an independent investigation of the informant's information and the absence of a history as an informant were not dispositive as other circumstances demonstrated the informant's veracity. The informant was identified by name, gave post-arrest statements against her penal interest, and provided detailed information about the drug transaction; specifically, the informant provided a detailed description of the events that took place during her visit with defendant and described seeing him go into his bedroom and return to the living room with methamphetamine, exchanging pills for the methamphetamine, and smoking some of the methamphetamine in defendant's presence. Also, despite the informant's drug addiction and criminal record, her statements were reliable. Thus, under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court agreed with the trial court that the taking of the land was of public use and necessity and not arbitrary and capricious.

Therefore, the instant court deferred to the county commissioners' determination of necessity. The owners' argument that they should have received personal notice of all of the public meetings leading up to the condemnation proceeding was unpersuasive. The county's legal description that did not exclude land previously acquired by it was sufficiently definite to comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.08.010. The trial court properly found that the county did not violate the Washington State Environmental Policy Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 43.21C, in deciding not to conduct a second environmental review. Although the owners argued that the trial court failed to comply with Wash. Super. Ct. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to first degree burglary, first degree robbery, second degree assault, theft of a firearm, and first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. The dismissal of defendant's subsequent personal restraint petition was reversed and remanded for resentencing. Upon resentencing, the Washington trial court imposed a 75-month sentence and ordered a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) identification analysis. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the provision in his sentence requiring him to submit a biological sample for DNA identification analysis was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and that the trial court erred in concluding that his burglary and theft convictions counted as separate offenses after finding during his original sentencing that they counted as one offense under the same criminal conduct rule. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that in light of case precedent upholding Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754, defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 43.43.754 failed. Because defendant's original sentence no longer existed as a final judgment on the merits, collateral estoppel did not apply; nor did the law of the case doctrine apply because the same criminal conduct issue was never before litigated. The fact that the trial court accepted defendant's invitation to reconsider its same criminal conduct determination, but did not resolve it in his favor, was not error. Even without defendant's invitation, the trial court was entitled to reconsider on remand its earlier same criminal conduct ruling on the burglary and theft counts.</SPAN></P>
