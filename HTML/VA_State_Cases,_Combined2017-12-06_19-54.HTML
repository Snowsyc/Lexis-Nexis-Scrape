Such a lot width waiver was a change in the size of the parcel, not its use, and was therefore a variance under &sect; 15.2-2201. Further, Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth indicted defendant, charging him with two violations of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-178. The case was before the court on defendant's motion for a bill of particulars and motion to compel an insurance company to respond to a subpoena duces tecum (SDT), and a motion by counsel for defendant's wife to quash a SDT.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the Commonwealth stated that it had an open file policy and the information defense counsel sought was available, it nevertheless agreed to respond to the bill of particulars. As for the SDT to the insurance company, the court noted that two of the disputed items, an e-mail from the insurance company to a law firm and from the firm to the insurance company were protected by attorney-client privilege and the third, an e-mail from one insurance company representative to another with a copy to counsel was likely so protected as well. As for the SDT seeking documents from the wife's counsel, the court noted that although defendant had a right to &quot;call for evidence&quot; under the first paragraph of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:12(a), it was not unconstitutionally compromised by the limitations in the second paragraph of Rule 3A:12(a). The court further noted that defendant failed to show that the information he sought regarding his wife's communications with government entities regarding the pending criminal charges existed, let alone was material. Absent some showing that there were documents to be had, defendant's effort was a fishing expedition, which was not permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court asked counsel to submit an order granting defendant's request for a bill of particulars, denying defendant's motion to compel, and granting the motion to quash filed by the wife's counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Virginia's Attorney filed a petition and notice of appeal of an order of imposition of taxes on behalf of certain citizens of a county under authority of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3003 (2010). The county's board of supervisors demurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of supervisors adopted an order for the imposition of taxes on real estate located in the county. The gist of the citizens' claim was that the reassessment of property on which the order was based was illegal and in violation of Va. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. The court found that the true nature of the citizens' claim was that the reassessment was inaccurate or otherwise unconstitutional. They alleged no facts, however, to support their legal conclusion that the reassessment was illegal or to give the board fair notice of the cause of action against it. Even with such factual support, however, the citizens improperly brought their challenge of the reassessment as a petition under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3003, attacking the order and praying that the court reverse it. However, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3003 provided a means of relief from illegal taxes, and the citizens alleged no error or illegality in the order. Thus, the citizens' naked allegations of illegality and unconstitutionality were conclusions of law and were insufficient by themselves to support a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the board's demurrer with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmates filed applications for writs of habeas corpus. Respondents, chairmen of the Virginia Parole Board and the superintendent of the Virginia State Police moved to dismiss the petitions on the ground that they were barred by the statute of limitations, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-654(A)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates claimed that the Suspension Clause of Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. cl. 2 required an exception to &sect; 8.01-654(A)(2) for claims based on newly discovered evidence that could not have been obtained through reasonable diligence within the limitations period. The circuit court held that the statute of limitations was probably not enacted to suspend the writ but to reduce prisoner litigation and to try to bring finality to criminal convictions. It found that the petitions were untimely. One petition was not filed within a reasonable time after the discovery of the claims. The inmate's allegation that a detective knew that he was innocent did not constitute a new habeas corpus claim in the absence of some other misconduct. There was nothing alleged in the petition that had not been previously alleged or known years ago. Under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-654(A)(2), a second inmate had until September 24, 2001, to file his petition. He filed his petition on August 3, 2010. A third inmate had until September 21, 2001, to file his petition, but he filed his petition on September 1, 2010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court granted respondents' motion to dismiss on the plea of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court held that the owner failed to plead any of the elements necessary to establish a cause of action for negligence. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 36-105 provided that the local building departments were responsible for enforcement of the Uniform State Building Code provisions, and the city code provided that the director of public health and certain law enforcement officers were authorized to enforce its provisions. Since penal and regulatory statutes did not automatically create private rights of action, the remedies provided in the Virginia and city codes were exclusive. The Fifth Amendment protected against deprivations of property by the federal government, and there had been no allegation thereof. The owner failed to state facts sufficient to allege a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments or &sect; 1983. He did not identify a city policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision pursuant to which defendants had acted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the school board discharged large volumes of polluted storm water run off from the retention basin directly under the property of the landowners, causing severe property damage to the landowners' property. The court held that the school board was not immune from the inverse condemnation suit for damages. Although the taking issue appeared tort-like in nature because the drainage constituted a continuing nuisance and trespass, the cause of action sounded in contract. The court also found that injunctive relief was appropriate because the legal remedy was clearly inadequate if the landowners were forced to repeatedly file separate lawsuits incurring substantial legal fees each time the school board caused additional damage to their property by continuing invasions of water.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that a taking had occurred and that injunctive relief and damages should be awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In many suits, consolidated for pretrial purposes, plaintiff homeowners sought damages from defendants, builders and suppliers, resulting from the importation, sale, and installation of defective Chinese drywall. Demurrers were raised to nine counts of the complaints. The parties reserved argument as Counts I, II, and XII, as well as individual legal issues not common to all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners alleged that the Chinese drywall was inherently defective because it emitted various sulfide gases and other toxic chemicals that created noxious odors and caused damage and corrosion to various systems within their homes, as well as personal and other household property items. They further alleged that the chemical compounds had caused and were causing personal injury to the occupants of the homes. The economic loss rule did not bar the homeowners' negligence claims because the allegations were that the drywall was damaging the property and causing health problems. The duty to avoid creating an unsafe condition within the homes and to avoid injuring the homeowners were duties imposed by law and not dependent upon the terms of the contracts. Next, the homeowners satisfied the pleading standard for a negligence per se claim and were entitled to refer to the building code for the required statutory violation. However, the homeowners' failure to plead anything about defendants' reasonable expectation to pay the homeowners for some benefit that they received was fatal to their unjust enrichment claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the demurrers to the general implied warranties, negligence, and negligence per se counts and sustained them to the unjust enrichment, private nuisance, equitable relief, and warranty of fitness counts. It overruled the suppliers' demurrers to the merchantability count, but sustained the builders' demurrers. It overruled the builders' demurrers to the consumer protection count, but sustained the suppliers' demurrers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county water authority filed a complaint against defendant City alleging that the City's practice of overcharging for municipal water service and transferring the profit to its general fund to subsidize other services in the City established an unconstitutional extra-territorial tax in violation of Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The water authority sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water authority and the City both provided municipal water service in the northeastern part of the county. Although a 30-year agreement identifying exclusive service areas for each provider had expired, the City continued to serve an area identified as an extended service region. The City operated its water service on a for-profit basis and charged about twice the rate charged by the water authority. Also, the City transferred profits from the water service revenues into its general fund. The City's charter, 1995 Va. Acts ch. 655, &sect; 13.09, required it to set water rates so that receipts were equal to expenses. The City's rate making for its water services was plainly at odds with the mandate of its charter. The profits derived from the rates charged to county residents violated the principle of no taxation without representation under Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and, thus, amount to an unconstitutional tax. The court declared  1993 Va. Acts ch. 969, &sect; 13.07 unconstitutional to the extent it permitted the City to transfer water moneys to the general fund in a manner inconsistent with the charter. Affirmative defenses of waiver, estoppel, and laches were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment in favor of the water authority, enjoined the City from transferring any moneys from its water fund to its general fund for purposes unrelated to the water system, ordered the City to comply with its charter in setting water rates, and declared a portion of the city charter unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions, plaintiff attorney filed suits against defendants, a county revenue commissioner and members of the county board of supervisors, seeking a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition setting aside certain real estate assessments. In both cases, the sole remaining question was whether the attorney should be sanctioned under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-271.1 for filing the actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the attorney filed suit against each individual member of the board of supervisors and the county revenue commissioner. The attorney named himself, in his individual capacity, as plaintiff and purported to represent 10,466 other individuals in a class action suit. He sought a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition ordering the board members and the commissioner to perform their duties. The case was improperly characterized as a class action, service of process was not proper, improper parties were named, the plaintiffs were inadequately identified, and inappropriate relief was requested. Accordingly, a fine was assessed as a sanction. In the second case, the attorney filed suit against the commissioner, named himself in an individual capacity, and purported to represent 250 other individuals. He sought a writ of mandamus ordering the commissioner to provide him all appraisal cards for two tax years. The attorney had every reason to know that his claim was not well grounded in fact and was not warranted by existing law. However, the only sanction imposed was its strong expression of disapproval of the attorney's misuse of the legal process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one case, the court assessed a fine against the attorney. In the other case, the court expressed strong disapproval of the attorney's misuse of the legal process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Owing to the infinite variety of claims pro se parties can make, the courts cannot devise a certain method for determining if a pro se party subject to a pre-filing injunction ought to be allowed to file a pleading.

The present petition was vexatious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed complaint was ordered not to be filed.

Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-410.1, petitioner driver asked the court to order the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles (Commissioner), to withdraw or rescind his order of revocation of her driving privileges. Her license was revoked due to a July 27, 2008 DWI conviction in Arkansas. Respondent, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of her petition, the driver argued that the revocation was a manifest injustice because the Commissioner made an error in law as the Arkansas DWI law, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-103 was not substantially parallel to the Virginia DWI law, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266. The driver contended that the two statutes were not substantially similar since they established different evidentiary standards or presumptions as sufficient to convict. Contrary to her assertion, the Arkansas DWI statute did not provide for a per se conviction or establish a conclusive presumption of guilt when the blood alcohol content of the defendant was 0.08 percent or more at the time of the testing. The driver argued unsuccessfully that the Arkansas DWI statute created a conclusive presumption of guilt. Neither the Arkansas DWI statute nor the Virginia DWI statute provide for such a presumption. Both states allowed for the introduction of additional evidence to rebut the presumption that the accused's blood alcohol concentration while driving was lower than the results of a subsequent test.</SPAN></P>

The officer then asked if the license was suspended, and defendant admitted that he was an habitual offender. The officer then arrested defendant. Defendant was seized in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

A reasonable person in defendant's position would have interpreted the officer's calling out as a signal to stop and a request to produce any driver's license within the ambit of Va.

The authority also sought damages and a judgment that the city's practice of overcharging for water and transferring the profit into its general fund amounted to an unconstitutional extraterritorial tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority alleged violations of the Virginia Antitrust Act and that the city's practice of overcharging for municipal water service and transferring the profit to its general fund to subsidize other services constituted an unconstitutional extraterritorial tax. The circuit court held that the state action doctrine did not immunize the city from liability under the Act. The city was not authorized to engage in anticompetitive behavior in the provision of municipal utility services in a neighboring municipality without first obtaining the consent of the neighboring municipality. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2112 permitted the city to operate waterworks outside its geographic limits without regard to anticompetitive effect only by agreement of the locality within whose geographic limits they were operating. Because an agreement to that effect expired, the city's anticompetitive acts were not authorized by statute. If county residents were required by law to use the city's service, and the city overcharged county residents to subsidize the cost of providing other services to residents of the city, the circuit court could not say that its conduct was immune from constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court issued a letter opinion resolving issues on a church's Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9 (2007) petitions regarding church property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church endowment fund was a non-profit corporation. The main purpose of the fund was to further the ministry and outreach of the Christian church. The church property was held by trustees. The circuit court held that the fund was not subject to the church's &sect; 57-9(A) petition. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-10 (2007) and, hence, &sect; 57-9, did not control the disposition of the endowment fund. Therefore, the disposition of the fund was reserved for resolution in the declaratory judgment action. The funds in question were held by a corporation, the church endowment fund. That form of corporate ownership took the fund wholly beyond the reach of the church's &sect; 57-9(A) petition. As a matter of law, the power to appoint directors to a charitable, non-stock, non-profit corporation was not a &quot;personal property&quot; interest. A two-acre parcel of land was deeded to the vestry of a parish and their successors. The circuit court concluded that the vestry of the church was the legal successor to the vestry of the parish as to the two-acre parcel. Therefore, the two-acre parcel was subject to the church's &sect; 57-9(A) petition. The land was owned by the vestry of the church and not by any other entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ruled that the parties were to prepare an order that reflected the decisions contained in the letter opinion and constituted a final order resolving all the petitions and such declaratory judgment actions as had been rendered moot by the circuit court's prior orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that defendant, a county Board of Supervisors, violated Virginia law by denying their request for an exception in connection with a subdivision application. The applicants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the standard of review to be used by the court in considering the merits of their claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants' property was zoned to the TR-3LRB (Transitional Residential-3) zoning district on the County Zoning Map. This designation would permit a by-right density of six residential lots and one open space lot. The granting of an exception by the board was a necessary precursor to subdivision approval due to lack of frontage of the proposed lots on a public road. The granting of an exception would permit the parcel, currently landlocked, to be accessed by a private road. The applicants argued that the denial of the exception was a ministerial act, not a legislative act. The court held that the board, in enacting the provisions of the ordinance providing for exceptions, had retained the power delegated to it by the General Assembly under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2242(1) to make such determinations, and that its actions were legislative, requiring the court to apply the fairly debatable standard of review. In acting upon the exception, the board was required to weigh the applicants' expectations against the public's interests in the private development's relation to the overall transportation needs of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denomination and diocese contended that &sect; 57-9, governing the determination of property rights on the division of a church, violated the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 10, cl. 1. The court held the only contractual rights at issue possibly subject to the Contracts Clause, which applied only retrospectively, were rights the denomination and diocese possessed in the congregations' property that vested when the predecessor to &sect; 57-9 was enacted in 1867. The denomination and diocese claimed their contractual rights in &quot;church plants&quot; pre-dated 1867. The court held that they could not have a pre-1867 vested right in properties of congregations that did not exist before 1867, as forming a contract required mutual assent and the communication of that assent, and congregations that did not yet exist in 1867 could not have communicated their assent to grant pre-1867 vested rights. The Contracts Clause did not protect alleged contractual rights in property not acquired before 1867, whether or not the congregations acquiring the property existed before 1867. And in 1867, religious denominations could not own or acquire an enforceable contractual interest in property in Virginia.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the claim of waiver had not been previously raised and was itself waived. It found that the congregations would be prejudiced if the trial court allowed the answers to be amended to raise waiver since the congregations had already defended against the claims that the statute was properly invoked, and whether it was constitutional, and would have to defend against the claim that the statute in the first instance did not apply at all.

There was no evidence that the owner's status as the sole facility in the nonattainment area was a basis for the regulation. The exceptions in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 10.1-1328(D)(3), (F) clearly indicated that an exchange between sister companies would be a &quot;purchase.&quot; Accordingly, the Clean Air Interstate Rule was not unconstitutional as applied to the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action involving a property dispute between a religious organization's governing body and a congregation, the Commonwealth renewed its motion to intervene for the limited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9(A). The governing body objected on grounds that, under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:14, the Commonwealth could not intervene, as it had no interests that placed it in the shoes of the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Rule 3:14 did not specifically address the question presented as to whether the Attorney General of Virginia was permitted to intervene in a Virginia state court to defend the constitutionality of a Virginia state statute. It was somewhat unusual for the Commonwealth to move to intervene in a state court to defend the constitutionality of a state statute, given that most constitutional challenges to Virginia statutes occurred in federal court. The Attorney General of Virginia had a unique interest in defending the constitutionality of the statutes of the Commonwealth. The court noted that the cases cited in support of the governing body's opposition to the motion did not involve a Virginia court denying the Attorney General intervenor status to defend the constitutionality of a Virginia statute; nor was the court aware of any such case. The Attorney General's defense of &sect; 57-9(A) did not change the fact that the case remained a property dispute between private parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, congregations belonging to a diocese of a national Christian church, filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9(A) regarding the distribution of church property. The court posed five questions to the parties and ordered them to prepare memoranda addressing their proposed answers to those questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The diocese argued that as Green v. Lewis began as a &sect; 57-9 case, its holding applied to any case brought under &sect; 57-9(A). The court disagreed. Green v. Lewis interpreted and applied Va. Code Ann, &sect; 57-15, not &sect; 57-9. A court presiding over a &sect; 57-9(A) petition was not required to consider the Green factors in addition to making the determinations actually required by &sect; 57-9(A). The phrase, &quot;if the determination be approved by the court&quot; used in &sect; 57-9(A) meant that the court had to consider whether the congregational vote was &quot;fairly taken,&quot;  in accordance with the provisions of &sect; 57-9(A). If the court found &sect; 57-9(A) to have been properly invoked, found &sect; 57-9(A) constitutional (which it did, except as to the diocese's Contract Clause claim, which it had not yet ruled on), and approved the determination of the congregation regarding its majority vote as to its choice of branch, this was &quot;conclusive&quot;--i.e., it became a matter decided. The phrase &quot;whose property is held by trustees,&quot; added to 57-9(A), did not change its meaning. Va. Code Ann &sect; 57-7.1 did not require the court to make a preliminary determination of ownership before embarking on a &sect; 57-9 analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court defined certain terms used in &sect; 57-9(A), held that Green v. Lewis was inapplicable to cases brought under &sect; 57-9(A), and that &sect; 57-7.1 did not affect the &sect; 57-9 analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered challenges to the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9(A) by various church entities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found &sect; 57-9(A) did not violate the Free Exercise, Establishment, Equal Protection, or Takings Clauses. As to the Free Exercise Clause, neither the historical context nor legislative history indicated that &sect; 57-9 was motivated by any type of hostility to religion in general. Because the General Assembly was motivated by a non-discriminatory purpose--resolving property disputes quickly and peacefully when a denomination divided--&sect; 57-9 was neutral and generally applicable. It also did not violate the Establishment Clause pursuant to the Lemon test, as &sect; 57-9 neither advanced nor inhibited religion. It did not differentiate between religious sects, but rather differentiated on how property was held. It did nothing to indoctrinate anyone in a particular religious belief. Section 57-9(A) did not violate the Takings Clause, as it was a statute designed to resolve church property disputes. When a court, pursuant to the statute, made an adjudication, its decision, for or against either party, did not constitute a taking. Under an Equal Protection analysis, there were many different bases, all rational, upon which the General Assembly could have decided to implement &sect; 57-9(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute was found constitutional. The parties were ordered to address three issues: (1) How did the court's opinions issued June 27, 2008, affect the scope of an October trial? What issues remained to be addressed in that trial? (2) How should the court adjust the scope of discovery to ensure it only encompassed those issues remaining to be heard at the trial? (3) the parties' positions regarding the Attorney General's motion to intervene?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The congregations decided to separate themselves from the diocese and filed Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9 petitions seeking decisions on how church property would be divided. The diocese filed answers to the petitions. Thereafter, the diocese filed a motion for leave to amend the answers to add the defense that the application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9(A) in the litigation violated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-2.02 (2007) governing the preservation of religious freedom. The diocese claimed that the amendment would not prejudice the congregations. The congregations responded that the motion to strike that they would filed would show that the amendment would be futile. The trial court found that the requested leave to amend should not be granted. It so concluded because it found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-2.02 on its face did not apply to litigation between private parties, such as was present before the trial court, but only to litigation in which a governmental entity was a party, which was not true of the present case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered a dispute between plaintiff congregations and defendants, a nation organization of a Christian denomination and a Virginia diocese of the denomination, over whether the powers and the authorities of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9(A) could be invoked in the parties' litigation related to the congregations' separation from defendants and attempt to retain their church property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute involved the denomination's position on human sexuality and other matters. The court found that, under &sect; 57-9(A), a &quot;division&quot; had occurred within the diocese. Over 7% of the churches in the diocese, 11% of its baptized membership and 18% of the diocesan average Sunday attendance of 32,000, had left the diocese in the previous two years. In addition, the court found that a division had occurred within the national organization. The record demonstrated that numerous congregations, clergy, and members had separated from the national organization as a result of internal strife within the organization, in order to establish a new polity for others to join. Since a new association of the congregations was formed, about 60 congregations, comprising 12,000 members, affiliated with the new association, and over 10,000 of these members had previously been in the national organization's congregations. The family of churches in the denomination was a &quot;religious society&quot; under &sect; 57-9(A), as the family of churches had been referred to in pronouncements by its various leaders as an international society of churches, with the archbishop described as its chief pastor, or president.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the congregations had properly invoked &sect; 57-9(A). Further proceedings were to take place in accordance with the court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church received a certificate of appropriateness to construct an addition that would have totalled 53 feet in height. The church constituted a proper, yet not a necessary party with respect to the claim for preliminary injunctive relief. However, it represented a necessary, indispensable party to a determination of the litigation on the merits. With regard to injunctive relief, the landowner possessed no adequate remedy at law and stood to suffer irreparable harm. If the City's actions violated Dillon's Rule or were determined to be unconstitutional, money damages would not serve to adequately compensate her. The landowner established the existence of a palpable danger of irreparable harm to her protected legal and private property interests absent issuance of preliminary injunctive relief. She enjoyed a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of her claim that the City's certificate of appropriateness process violated Dillon's Rule, on her procedural due process claim, and on her equal protection claim. The genus of her claim alleged a procedural, not substantive, violation of her federal constitutional right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the violators was cited for a traffic violation under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-206.1. They did not raise a challenge to the constitutionality of the remedial driver fees contained in &sect;&nbsp;46.2-206.1 in their separate criminal matters, but instead, they brought the declaratory judgment action. The court had previously denied the violators' requests for injunctive and equitable relief. The Commonwealth sought dismissal of the action, based on the alleged bar of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. However, the violators asserted that their claim fell within the broad parameters of the &quot;actual controversy&quot; language of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;8.01-184. The court initially noted that one violator had not yet been tried, but that the other two were convicted, such that at the least, the two who were convicted had direct and justiciable interests in the matter.

The mayor and CFO filed a demurrer and alternative pleas in bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor and CFO were not immune from the lawsuit under Richmond, Va., City Charter &sect; 2.08 as the action the school board and council sought to enjoin was not a proceeding. The school board had standing to sue as the mayor was not a governmental agency under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 22.1-82 and actions between the board and the governing body were exempt from the statute's prior approval requirement. The ordinance did not contravene Richmond, Va., City Charter &sect; 4.09 as it authorized a lease for one year, nor did it repeal or amend Richmond, Va., City Code &sect; 26-2. The ordinance did not contravene Richmond, Va., City Code &sect; 2-191 et seq., as the manager of the city real estate services was not responsible for leasing or acquiring property. The ordinance did not improperly confer contract rights on the school system as the name of the lessee could be changed prior to execution. The ordinance did not violate Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14(8), where the funding was transferred from the city and returned to the city and as a result, an obligation of a person, corporation, or association had not been diminished.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue was whether the assessment of civil remedial fees under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-206.1 on residents of Virginia, but not on non-residents, violated equal protection. The appellate court found that the purpose of the statute was to generate revenue. Virginia residents were not similarly situated for all relevant purposes to non-Virginia residents. Further, non-Virginia residents did not have the same burden to pay for the maintenance and improvement of Virginia roads that Virginia residents did, as Virginia residents had a higher use of the roads and therefore a higher obligation to maintain them. This was strong evidence that the legislature was aware of the cost of imposing and collecting these fees. They stated the cost of collection in such strong terms that they take out the costs first and only the remainder went into the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund. Being aware of the cost of collection, they reasonably may have felt that the collection of fees 14 and 26 months after conviction of non-resident defendants was not economically productive. This was a rational basis on which to differentiate the classes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parked his vehicle, walked across a parking lot, and approached two men, seeking to hire them to do yard work. He was arrested for violating the ordinance, which prohibited motorists for exiting their vehicles to solicit pedestrians to work for them. The town argued the ordinance was intended to curtail the visual blight and threat to traffic and pedestrian safety caused by vehicular solicitation of employment. The appellate court held that the ordinance was a content-neutral regulation because it was justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech. It was not facially overbroad, but was narrowly tailored to serve substantial government interests. However, the temporary assembly site established by the ordinance, where potential employers and employees could solicit employment, was insufficient to show that the ordinance left open &quot;ample alternative channels&quot; of communication that provided a reasonable opportunity for all persons to engage in the restricted speech. By its terms, the ordinance would remain in effect and be enforced indefinitely, not only so long as the temporary assembly site existed. Thus, the ordinance violated the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that defendant bore the burden of demonstrating that there could be no conceivable set of facts that would rationally support the distinction made in &sect; 46.2-206.1 between Virginia residents and non-residents. The Commonwealth had no obligation to produce any evidence in support of the law. The appellate court found that there was a conceivable rational basis for the legislation's classifications and held that Va. Code &sect; 46.2-206.1 was constitutional. The purpose of &sect; 46.2-206.1 was to generate revenue from drivers whose proven dangerous driving behavior placed significant financial burdens on the Commonwealth, and Virginia residents had more of an obligation to finance their own roads than did non-residents driving through on Virginia's highways.</SPAN></P>

Defendants raised a demurrer on the grounds of the council's capacity to sue and defendants' sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants said (1) the council could not sue and, therefore, lacked standing, and (2) sovereign immunity barred a suit against them. The council had standing as it properly alleged it could sue in its own name as the city's governing body, rather than in the city's name. It was the city's &quot;governing body,&quot; under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-102, as, under Richmond, Va., City Charter &sect; 4.02, it exercised all city powers. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-1404 gave it broad power to sue in its own name as to all matters connected with its duties. Nothing restricted it from suing the mayor or other defendants. Sovereign immunity did not protect defendants because the complaint's allegation that their acts were ultra vires had to be deemed truthful. The council alleged it had the power to appoint people to the positions in question and that defendants' dismissal of those employees exceeded the scope of their delegated powers. When council sued defendants &quot;in their official capacity,&quot; this did not mean defendants' acts were lawful. The complaint's allegation that those acts were unlawful and outside the scope of governmental authority was sufficient to withstand a demurrer based on sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonresidents challenged the assessment on income passed through to them from their membership in a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) that was qualified to do business in Virginia. The assessed income came from a settlement of long pending litigation brought by the LLC against a competitor. Believing that the income was not subject to tax, the nonresidents did not report the settlement proceeds when they filed their nonresident income tax returns. The court found, inter alia, that the underlying lawsuit settlement, which generated income to the nonresidents, was a distribution of income from an intangible asset, which could be a Virginia source of income as defined in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-302 and includable as income under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-325. Because two of the nonresidents owned property in Virginia, they had minimum contact with Virginia to allow the assessment of the income. However, since the third nonresident's only connection to Virginia was the fact that the LLC could do business in Virginia, there were no facts that would place a nexus between him and Virginia for due process or commerce clause purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents claimed that the transfer of a toll road and toll revenue derived therefrom from the Commonwealth defendants to the airport authority was an unlawful delegation or assignment, and an unlawful transfer of state assets and the legislative ability to tax, in violation of Va.

But, because sovereign immunity barred consideration of their complaint against both the Commonwealth defendants and the airport authority, and the legislature had not waived said immunity, the instant court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Further, neither the statutes nor the constitutional provisions cited in the complaint waived sovereign immunity.

The applicant's claim that the city granted licenses to businesses that applied permanent makeup, or, in the alternative, that it did not enforce the ordinance against such businesses, sufficiently stated a claim of an equal protection violation to survive the demurrer. The ordinance's total ban on tattooing conflicted with Virginia's public policy of restricting but not banning tattooing, as expressed in Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.2-912 and 18.2-371.3. Therefore, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 1-248 and the Dillon Rule, the applicant pled sufficient facts to allow its petition to survive the city's demurrer to its claim that the city's ordinance was not consistent with state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The demurrer was overruled with respect to the applicant's claim that the ordinance violated its equal protection rights and was not consistent with state law. The demurrer was sustained as to the applicant's claim that the ordinance violated constitutional free speech protections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against defendant health care providers after the claimant's pregnant wife died while in their care. The health care providers filed a motion pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-607 (2006) to impose the nonresident bond requirement on the claimant and an issue arose about the amount of the nonresident bond requirement to be imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sued the health care providers for medical malpractice after the claimant's pregnant wife saw the health care providers for medical problems she was experiencing, she lapsed into a coma, and she eventually died after giving birth to the couple's child, who also died. The health care providers filed a motion to impose a nonresident bond on the claimant pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-607 (2006). The claimant asserted that the bond amount should be relatively small, but the health care providers requested a much higher bond, which the claimant argued was unreasonable. The trial court determined that the amount of the bond should cover the costs essential to the prosecution of the lawsuit, such as the filing fees or charges for service of process. The trial court thus determined that the nonresident bond should be in an amount slightly higher than that requested by the claimant, but far less than the amount requested by the health care providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the specific amount of the nonresident bond to be imposed on the claimant was $ 318.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it was undisputed that the newspaper was one of general circulation, published in English, and published at least once per week. However, the company could not comply with the requirement of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-324(A)(1) because it did not provide the court with a bona fide list of paying subscribers. The court found that the list provided by the company was de minimis rather than substantial and did not meet the requirements of &sect; 8.01-324(A)(1). The court determined that &sect; 8.01-324(A)(1) as applied was not an unlawful attempt to restrict the company's First Amendment rights under an intermediate scrutiny analysis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that complainants had standing to bring the action because the subdivision would affect their property rights. Next, the city's subdivision ordinances, enabled by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2242, were facially valid. The ordinances provided significant standards, policies, and procedures that made their general delegation of authority to the planning commission's agent valid. As for the ordinances' validity in relation to &sect; 15.2-2242(1), they were the same or stricter than the enabling statute and thus were to be harmonized with it. Next, the approval of the subdivision plan with exceptions and modifications to the ordinances was not arbitrary and capricious. Complainants had not shown that the agent failed to comply with the subdivision ordinances. Furthermore, the city had acted with regard to facts, law, and determining principle. Its review of the plan, which took nearly a year, was thorough, systematic, and extremely detailed and included review and comment by the city's traffic and engineering departments, among others. Numerous submissions, correspondences, comments, meetings, and alterations to the plan took place over the course of nearly a year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city sought to withdraw from a use and support agreement. The city alleged that the General Assembly intended to limit the phrase &quot;written obligations&quot; to written financial instruments and that the city would not remain liable under the agreement after its withdrawal. It also alleged that the agreement required the city to effectively remain a member of a disposal group despite withdrawal. The disposal group filed a demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city entered into an agreement as to solid waste disposal with the disposal group. In 2000 Va. Acts ch. 596, the General Assembly extended the life of the disposal group indefinitely, but also created a mechanism for member localities to withdraw from the group at any time, without regard to any outstanding bonds issued by the group. The group did not dispute the city's right to withdraw. However, it asserted that the city had failed to allege facts to support its contention that it need not honor the agreement. The court held that to hold that the term &quot;written obligations&quot; was limited to &quot;written financial instruments such as bonds, indentures, and notes&quot; would require a narrow and strained construction. The city utilized its discretionary authority in exercising the granted power to contract for the collection and disposal of waste by electing to become a member of the group at its inception and by entering into the agreement. Nothing in the method selected by the city in exercising the granted power was unreasonable. The agreement neither deprived the city of its ability to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, nor illegally bartered away its legislative powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The demurrer was sustained with prejudice as to both the city's counts. The city's motion for preliminary injunctive relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the rebuttable presumptions did not violate the due process rights of defendant, as the court was required to analyze the rebuttable presumptions at issue as permissive inferences, as to which defendant had no standing to make a facial constitutional challenge. The court further concluded that the admission of the blood alcohol certificate did not contravene Crawford. The attestation clause of the certificate of blood alcohol analysis was non-testimonial hearsay. The statements of the breath test operator in the attestation clause did not accuse defendant of any wrongdoing but simply laid the foundation for the admission of the certificate under the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Roanoke City General District Court (Virginia) for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266. On a de novo appeal, he filed a motion to dismiss the charge and a motion to declare parts of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-269 and 18.2-270&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first rejected defendant's argument that a 60-day administrative license suspension (ALS) under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-391.2 rendered a subsequent DUI prosecution violative of double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment and Va. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. Decisions holding a seven-day ALS to be civil in nature, not criminal, indicated that the 60-day requirement was also civil. The only difference was the longer duration of the suspension here, and that did not change the result. For the same reason, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-294 did not bar a subsequent DUI prosecution. Next, the presumptions of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-266(i) and 18.2-269(A)(3) were permissible inferences because they did not remove the element of alcohol content from a case and did not shift the burden of persuasion to a defendant. Thus, they did not violate defendant's rights to due process and confrontation under the United States Constitution and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The imposition of an enhanced punishment under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-270 was also constitutional. A penalty under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-270 relied on a violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266, which kept the burden of persuasion with the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated, in violation of &sect; 18.2-266.

The court held that it would not address defendant's argument regarding &sect; 18.2-270 because the challenged provisions of that section would not and could not affect any sentence that she might receive. Defendant's blood alcohol level was 0.11, well below the threshold level of 0.15 necessary to implicate the challenged provisions of &sect; 18.2-270. As to &sect; 18.2-269, its rebuttable presumptions were to be given permissive or burden-of-production shifting effect only. The Virginia General Assembly was well within its authority to find that a blood alcohol level of 0.08 and above created a permissive inference that an individual was &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 18.2-266(ii). There was a rational connection between the proven fact of blood alcohol content and the ultimate fact presumed of driving under the influence of alcohol.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants raised an issue about whether &sect; 18.2-269 could be construed to establish a valid permissive inference instead of a rebuttable presumption. The circuit court found that &sect; 18.2-269 would violate due process if interpreted as shifting the burden to defendants to rebut an element of the offense that the fact-finder would otherwise be required to conclude. When the charge was driving under the influence of alcohol, a mandatory rebuttable presumption that required the fact-finder upon the presentation of a certain blood alcohol level to conclude that defendants were under the influence of alcohol, unless rebutted by them, would adversely affect their right to trial by jury and their right to remain silent. It would diminish the requirement of the State to prove defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Only if &sect; 18.2-269 could reasonably be read to provide a permissible inference could it satisfy due process requirements. The circuit court found that due process required that &sect; 18.2-269 be treated as creating a permissible inference, rather than as a mandatory rebuttable presumption. So construed, the statute was constitutional, both facially and as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-910 on the grounds that it was an impermissible delegation of legislative authority and that it was vague and ambiguous and did not provide sufficient due process notice so as to allow a citizen to know what was required or proscribed. The court first concluded that &sect;&nbsp;46.2-910 was not an improper delegation of legislative authority, as the governmental policy of what was proscribed or required remained within the control of the legislature; the fact that references were made to scientific or engineering standards to assure the utmost safety of those engaged in operating motorcycles did not mean that the legislative authority supporting the policy was transferred to those developing the standards. The court also held that the referenced standards in the third sentence of &sect; 46.2-910, as they applied to protective helmets, were unconstitutionally vague, denied due process, and were unenforceable. The standards applicable to manufacturers and designers for use in the production of protective headgear did not provide sufficient due process notice of the conduct required or the type of protective helmet mandated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained against him. An evidentiary hearing was held, and both defendant and the Commonwealth submitted briefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A university police officer observed what he believed to be reckless driving by defendant. After stopping defendant the officer arrested him after further investigation led the officer to suspect defendant was driving under the influence. Although the officer knew he was outside the university police's patrol area, he believed he was authorized to patrol the area under an agreement with the city. The court found that the violation of the &quot;color of office&quot; doctrine did not amount to a Fourth Amendment violation. The officer had clear grounds for a citizen's arrest based on a breach of the peace in his presence. In the course of that arrest, by observing defendant's appearance and conduct, in addition to the reckless driving, the officer gained probable cause to believe that he was driving under the influence. The officer's actions relied on the authority of Va. Code. &sect; 19.2-17, which he reasonably and in good faith believed to be the established law, but which had been repealed. However, the officer's arrest of defendant was not a lawful arrest sufficient to implement the implied consent law. The motion to suppress the breath test analysis certificate therefore had to be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress was granted in part and denied in part. The observations by the officer of both defendant's driving and defendant's appearance were admissible, as were the statements volunteered to the officer by defendant before he took the sobriety tests. Further, the field sobriety tests were admissible. However, the certificate of the breath analysis was not admissible.</SPAN></P>

He turned on the engine of the car so that he could run the heater. He did not move the car. Thereafter, defendant was arrested by a university police officer for driving under the influence of alcohol. The court found that the term &quot;operate&quot; was included in &sect; 18.2-266 to reach acts that were beyond the basic act of driving or putting the vehicle in motion. The term included starting the engine or manipulating the mechanical or electrical agencies of the vehicle. Because defendant had unquestionably started the engine and manipulated the mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle, it fell well within the well-established definition of operate. In addition, defendant's purpose was unnecessary to the finding of guilt. The statute penalized his actions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In analyzing the contract at issue, the contractor denied that it owed liquidated damages and made no claim as to the overpayment. But, despite the contractor's bankruptcy, specifications imposed it a duty to repay any overpayment. Moreover, any required repayment of an overpayment was covered by the performance bond issued by the surety. Hence, if the contractor was obligated under the contract and the specifications to repay the overpayment, then the surety was also liable unless something occurred that resulted in a discharge, which the court failed to find. First, sovereign immunity did not prevent the doctrine of discharge from being used against the Department. Second, the surety was not discharged due to a material alteration in the contract. Third, the release, which was part of a settlement agreement between the Department and the contractor, did not release the contractor. It merely settled the contractor's claim that it did not owe liquidated damages, from which the surety could not complaint. Finally, the administrative claims procedure under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33.1-386 was available to the contractor and nothing deprived it of its rights thereunder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the pastor was employed by the church pursuant to an at-will employment contract as a pastor, a position qualifying as a minister under the functional tests which inquired as to the religious nature of the position. Because the dispute involved the church leadership's decision as to who would direct the spiritual welfare of its congregation, extreme deference was owed to the actions of the church members pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. I and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court did not believe the allegations made out a cause of action under either the &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;collusion&quot; exceptions, assuming their vitality, to the general principle of judicial restraint under Milivojevich. Moreover, while &quot;neutral principles&quot; had been employed to consider certain church property disputes, the application of these principles was not appropriate given the primarily ecclesiastical nature of the contentions, particularly considering the extreme deference owed by courts to a church's selection of its clergy. The Virginia Supreme Court had recognized a limited &quot;ministerial exception&quot; to the &quot;neutral principles&quot; doctrine, and it applied to the facts alleged in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A university police officer noticed defendant's car traveling at a high rate of speed and make a rolling stop before turning right on a red light.

The court found that a memorandum of agreement between the city and the university and the circuit court order approving it did not adhere to the clear terms of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-234(iv), 15.2-1726. Therefore, the arrest was unlawful as it was conducted beyond the officer's jurisdictional limits. Consequently, the certificate of breath analysis was inadmissible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an officer stopped defendant for speeding, the officer discovered that defendant's driver's license was suspended due to two prior convictions of driving while suspended. The officer arrested defendant, and searched the car. The court found that the initial alleged offense, a third driving with a suspended license violation, was a class 1 misdemeanor and was punishable by a minimum, mandatory jail term of ten days without suspension. The provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-74(A)(1) therefore governed the case. The totality of the circumstances showed that defendant had repeatedly refused to cease his unlawful activity despite numerous past prohibitions and supported an objectively reasonable belief that he would be likely to disregard a summons by continuing to drive or failing to appear in court. This conclusion was bolstered by the fact that, unlike the previous driving-on-suspended convictions, he would be required to serve jail time in this instance. Accordingly, the officer appropriately exercised his statutory discretion, the arrest was not illegal, and the subsequent search of the passenger compartment of the vehicle was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the employee alleged that he was terminated, in breach of his employment contract, in retaliation for a complaint that he made. The court found that the employee failed to state a cause of action for his claims of insulting words because the statements were relative in nature and depended largely upon the speaker's viewpoint; therefore, the employee failed to state facts that supported a cause of action for defamation based upon the statements. Further the employee's claims of defamatory statements made by two supervisors to others were qualifiedly privileged because the supervisors were providing a reason for the employee's discharge. Finally, the employee failed to show improper termination because language in an employee handbook did not create a contractual term that overrode disclaimers that he signed, and his at-will employment contract was not converted to a termination-for-cause contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bill of complaint for divorce was filed on the client's behalf in 1993, the client retained the attorney to obtain the divorce.

The court held that because the judge's ruling was never challenged by direct appeal, it was final and binding. Accordingly, the second divorce decree never had any effect and the client was injured upon its entry. The breach of contract between the attorney and the client occurred at that same time. Therefore, because the client's motion for judgment was filed well after the applicable statute of limitations for either oral or written contracts had expired, the application of &sect; 8.01-230 to the facts at bar did not violate the client's constitutional right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Virginia Waste Management Board adopted two regulations regarding the transportation of solid and medical waste on state waterways: a 24-inch standing water test for determining whether a container was watertight and a one dollar per ton of waste fee for off-loading such waste.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Virginia Waste Management Board adopted two regulations regarding the transportation of solid and medical waste on state waterways. The first regulation prescribed a 24-inch standing water test for determining whether a container transporting such waste was watertight. The second regulation established the fee collected by facilities that receive solid and medical waste transported on state waters, namely, a fee of one dollar per ton of waste off-loaded at such facilities. The association contended that the two regulations violated the Virginia Waste Management Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 10.1-1400 et seq. (Act), and that the procedural requirements of the Administrative Process Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.2-4000 et seq. (Administrative Act), were violated in adopting the regulations. The trial court found that the 24-inch standing water test violated the Act because it did not establish that a whole container was watertight, but also found that the one dollar fee did not violate the Act. The trial court also found that the procedural requirements of the Administrative Act were followed and were not violated, and that an award of attorney fees was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the pleas in bar in two cases where defendant county board of supervisors denied the petition of plaintiff limited liability company (LLC) for a conditional use permit to operate a shotgun sports center in an Agricultural A-1 District.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, counts one, two, three, four, and five were an appeal of board of supervisors' decision. On February 4, 2004, the board denied the LLC's petition for a conditional use permit to operate a shotgun sports center in an Agricultural A-1 District. The LLC did not file its appeal until March 16, 2004, beyond the 30-day limit for noting an appeal under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2285(F). In count six the LLC alleged that its constitutional right to hunt had been violated. This was an issue that was not subject to the decision of the board on February 4, 2004. In the second case, the LLC claimed the county zoning ordinance effectively had a county-wide ban on hunting because it prevented sporting clays, shooting facilities, and shooting ranges. This was a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment. The allegations in counts one, two, and four were allegations of legal and constitutional rights to engage in this business. Where it was alleged that constitutional rights were violated, and such violations affected the validity of the ordinance as a whole, a declaratory judgment action was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix filed a negligence action against defendants, a pharmaceutical manufacturer and health-care providers. Among other things, the administratrix alleged that the providers negligently diagnosed, treated, and cared for the decedent, and that as a direct and proximate result of that negligence the decedent expired. The providers filed a special plea of the statute of limitations and a motion to limit recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers contended that the action was barred under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-243, because it was filed more than two years after their last medical treatment of the decedent. In denying the providers' special plea of the statute of limitations, the court concluded that the subject claims were medical malpractice claims of negligence under the wrongful death statute. As such, they were subject to the statute of limitations in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-244, which by its plain language permitted the administratrix to bring the cause of action within two years of the decedent's death. In the motion to limit recovery, the providers argued that the ad damnum had to t be reduced because it exceeded the statutory cap for medical malpractice actions. The administratrix alleged that the proper method of addressing the issue was for the court to permit the ad damnum and order a post-verdict remittitur, if necessary, after the jury assessed damages. The court agreed with the administratrix, noting that it was within the province of the jury to reach a verdict as to damages, and then the duty of the court to apply the law and, if necessary, reduce the award to comport with the statutory cap.</SPAN></P>

On that information they obtained a search warrant and found drugs. Defendant moved to suppress, arguing that neither the exigent circumstances nor community caretaker exceptions to the warrant requirement justified the initial entry. He argued that because the officers entered on the belief that a crime occurred or was in progress, they were investigating criminal activity, which precluded the exceptions. The court found that the routine investigation of the open door was not the type of criminal investigation that precluded the exceptions. Ongoing investigations of defendant or the premises precluded the exceptions. The officers reasonably entered the house on suspicion that the inhabitants needed assistance, they did not search for anything except people, and the illicit pipes were in plain view.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;19.2-266.2 to identify the components of the vileness aggravating factor on which it intended to rely in seeking the death penalty because the indictment, the discovery responses, and defendant's opportunity to hear the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing adequately informed him of the charged offense; (2) the Commonwealth's failure to conduct tests on drug paraphernalia items found at the scene did not violate defendant's constitutional right to have exculpatory evidence under Brady; (3) even if defendant did have such a right, the items were not linked to the victims and/or witnesses so there could be no suggestion that the results would have in any way exonerated defendant; but (4) the defense was free to comment at trial on the inferences that could be drawn from the absence of such tests.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that TUBES violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech, contravened due process protection against vagueness, was inconsistent with the Commerce Clause, and offended double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In ruling on defendants' motions to dismiss, the court held that: (1) TUBES was not an unlawful content-based prior restraint on speech because, even assuming that TUBES implicated the First Amendment, the routing information affected only the manner in which the protected speech was conveyed and not the content of the message and limited only the use of false or forged transmission of routing information by senders of electronic mail, leaving open other channels of communication for those seeking to get their message to the public; (2) the felony provisions of TUBES satisfied constitutionally protected due process requirements in that the volume of the transmissions was clearly delineated; (3) the multiple-count indictments did not violate principles of double jeopardy because they charged separate times when the criminal conduct was allegedly committed; and (4) TUBES did not violate the dormant commerce clause because the Commonwealth had an interest in the protection of the property interests of its citizens and the requirement of TUBES that intentionally disingenuous information be deleted from the routing process was not a weighty burden.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted immunity from any future prosecution arising out of his illegal gambling activities. The forfeiture of his property was not included in the plea agreement, nor was disposition of the seized property. Notwithstanding the civil nature of the case, defendant contended that the production of the requested documents unconstitutionally exposed him to further criminal prosecutions and/or sanctions. Nonetheless, because the records sought by the State were germane to defendant's illegal gambling activities and, in particular, the issue of whether the items seized from his residence were used in connection with, or derived from, those activities, he was not entitled to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to the discovery requests.</SPAN></P>

Defendants demurred on various grounds and filed a motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members sought relief from the enactment of the budget bill arguing that: (1) it violated the single object rule contained in Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12; (2) unless the instant court were to declare the bill unconstitutional and/or enjoin the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Speaker of the House from signing it, it was likely that the House and the Senate would continue to disagree; and, (3) if no agreement was reached before July 1, 2004, funds would not be available to pay them and their expenses. The instant court first held that a vote on the bill was part of the members' duties as legislators. Further, any injury suffered regarding funding was an injury suffered by all employees of the Commonwealth and the members lacked standing as individual taxpayers. Also, a decision rendered by the court would violate the separation of powers doctrine. Even if such a decision were to be entered, it would amount to an advisory opinion. Last, Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12 was inapplicable, as it was not an enacted law, but a bill. Due to the aforementioned, defendants' remaining arguments were not addressed.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that the residents failed to bear the burden of rebutting the presumption that the BZA's decision was correct. The court found that the record was full of evidence that the BZA carefully considered the affects of the proposed use on the surrounding areas and found that other houses of worship existed. The court found that any concerns regarding the property size were addressed by the unambiguous conditions placed upon the applicants by the BZA with regard to floor area ratio, omission of a child day-care center, and parking spaces. The court found no evidence to support the residents' claims that traffic was adversely affected and noted that every church had social aspects to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that Va. Code Ann. tit. 25.1 was unconstitutional, as owners whose property was being sold in other circumstances were given greater rights to seek to reopen the judgment. The trial court held that Va. Code Ann. tit. 25.1 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, as condemnees were not a suspect class, and the statute had a rational basis in giving faster finality to protect governmental actions taken on public projects. The statute also did not violate the Due Process Clause, as notice by publication afforded the owner a reasonable opportunity to be heard and the failure to allow two years to reopen was not constitutionally required by the Due Process Clause. The NRHA made diligent efforts to locate the owner, and she was provided with reasonable notice under the circumstances and a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Finally, the owner received just compensation. Because the owner was not present at the proceedings, the trial court was charged with ensuring that she received the same amount as if she had been represented by counsel at the proceedings. The hearing was not a one-sided result and that was all that a condemnee could ask for.</SPAN></P>

A police officer testified that he found three sexually explicit visual images, involving juveniles, in the temporary Internet file of defendant's computer cache. Defendant argued he could not be convicted of knowingly possessing these images, as they could have appeared on his computer screen as &quot;pop-ups&quot; from a website other than one he intentionally accessed, and because none of those images were &quot;manually&quot; downloaded into the computer. The court disagreed. The issue was whether he &quot;reached out for and controlled&quot; the images at issue. His Internet searches, which included the terms &quot;Lolitas,&quot; (commonly used in the search for child pornography), &quot;pedophelia,&quot; and &quot;pre-teen pictures,&quot; along with his knowing possession of another child pornography image that had to be manually downloaded, showed that he reached out for these images with the intent to control and have dominion over them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership, which sold exclusively one line of Japanese cars, terminated its franchise with a franchisee. The Commissioner, applying Va.

On appeal, the dealership argued that the Commissioner erred and that its due process rights to a fair and impartial hearing were violated. The Commissioner and DMV asserted that the court could only consider whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the findings. The court found that the constitutional claims should be reviewed de novo and the DMV's decision for substantial evidence. It then concluded that the decision should not be disturbed, finding that a consideration of the factors under Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix filed a motion for judgment against defendant police officers on behalf of her deceased brother, who died after being handcuffed by the officers. She alleged unlawful seizure in count I, unlawful force and violence in count II, intentional, deliberate, and gross negligence in count III, conspiracy in count IV, and racial bias and prejudice in count V. Defendants demurred to all but count III.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count I may have stated a claim for the intentional tort of false imprisonment. Therefore, the officers' demurrer to count I was overruled. The officers' demurrer to count II was also overruled because the administratrix had alleged facts sufficient to state causes of action for the torts of assault and battery. The administratrix's claim in count IV was equivalent to a wrongful death action under Va. Code &sect; 8.01-50 et seq. However, the claim only included activities occurring after the death of the decedent; the administratrix had not sufficiently stated a claim for conspiracy for activities occurring prior to decedent's death. Therefore, the officers' demurrer to count IV was overruled to the extent the administratrix claimed damages for conspiracy occurring after the decedent's death. Finally, the officers' demurrer to count V was sustained because the count was apparently based upon Va. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners applied to have their property rezoned from residential to general industrial so they could establishing a roofing business. In accordance with the Fairfax County Zoning Ordinance, the owners' proffers became a part of Fairfax County's zoning regulations as they applied to the owners' property. The county board of supervisors granted the owners' application on the condition that the limitation expressed in their proffer was to include the prohibition on outside storage. Later, inspections of the premises revealed the outside storage of vehicles, machinery, construction equipment and materials, and general debris. Resisting the zoning administrator's enforcement attempts, the owners argued that the term &quot;outside storage&quot; in Fairfax County, Va., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 20-300 was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed; the term was clear, and included construction equipment, machinery, inoperable vehicles or parts thereof, boats, and/or farm machinery. However, it did not include items whose outdoor placement was an acceptable community practice (such as vehicles licensed for roadway use), or whose inherent structure made inside storage overly burdensome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since an officer had no reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver or occupants of a car had violated the law, he had no Fourth Amendment right to stop the vehicle. However, he did not &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;seize&quot; the vehicle, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The driver of the Cadillac parked her vehicle in a lot that was open to the public. When the officer also stopped his vehicle in the lot, he did nothing to restrict or restrain the other driver's freedom to drive away. The officer's unexpressed determination to detain the occupants of the car until they had produced identification was of little consequence. When the officer detained the defendant and his companions, he exceeded his statutory authority under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-249. The arrest violated a statutory provision, but not the U.S. Constitution, so the defendant was not entitled to have evidence seized pursuant to the arrest excluded. Because the defendant's arrest was not constitutionally invalid, his motion to suppress was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the restaurant applied for a license to sell alcoholic beverages on premises, a local neighborhood association opposed it, recommending instead a restricted license. The restaurant agreed to the restricted license. Without a hearing, the Board issued the restaurant a restricted license for the sale of alcoholic beverages. The following month, the restaurant applied to remove the restrictions on the grounds that it was misled into believing that it would be easier to accept a restricted license and reapply for a full license, and that the economic impact of the restricted license would force it to close. The court found that (1) the Board appropriately relied on a letter from the neighborhood association and its agent for its decision; (2) the Board's decision to deny a hearing was based upon substantial evidence; (3) limiting the time within which the restaurant was permitted to re-apply for a license was an acceptable standard developed by the Board; (4) the Board's decision to deny the claim was not arbitrary and capricious; and (5) Va. Code Ann. &sect; 4.1-224(B)(4) did not violate the restaurant's substantive and procedural due process rights, and was not too broad in scope.</SPAN></P>

The other two transactions involved his participation in drug sales in cars outside the lounge. The Board then found the lounge had violated the statute. After the lounge appealed, the appellate court found that little deference would be accorded to the Board's decision since statutory interpretation was involved. It then found that the term &quot;meeting place or rendezvous&quot; required prearrangement or predesignation, which was not shown in the sales inside the lounge. It also found that as to the other two sales, the statute required two or more persons to be involved as an essential element of the charge, and since the government informant could not be counted as one of those persons, it was not shown that two or more persons were involved in the offense.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 125-1 to -15, invalid, as authorizing warrantless inspections, and as authorizing defendant town to discontinue electric service to any non-complying property. The town filed a plea in bar against one landlord, and demurrers in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords sought to have the Code declared invalid. The court found that the landlord had a direct interest in the application of the ordinance, as it applied to his rental property. The Code did not provide for warrantless searches. The inspections authorized under the ordinance were conducted either by consent of the owner or of the tenant in possession or by other lawful means, which included an administrative inspection warrant. The provisions for inspection were not unconstitutional. The method of periodic inspections based upon a change in tenancy adopted by the town to implement the power specifically conferred upon it to enforce the Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC), Va. Code Ann. &sect; 36-97 et seq., was reasonable, and did not violate Dillon's Rule. The penalty provisions were identical to the provisions of the USBC, except that the maximum penalty was less in the Code. The town manager had the power to enforce the Code. The provision permitting the town to terminate service to non-complying properties violated Dillon's Rule and could not be enforced.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that distinctions between governmental functions and proprietary functions did not apply to state government. Accordingly, the plea of sovereign immunity was sustained. Second, the comptroller's response was a disallowance of the researcher's claim as required by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-192 before suit could be filed, and on that ground it was overruled. Since there was no final payment or beginning of work by the researchers, the time for giving notice of their intention to file a claim commenced at the time of the occurrence. Moreover, it was not known when the first or final payment under the alleged contract was to be due. This was a question of fact that could not be determined on demurrer.

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-49.1(A) was an entirely different issue, as the statute only made &quot;clear and significant&quot; violations of court orders a criminal offense. The court found that vagueness could invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons. First, it could fail to provide adequate notice that would enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibited. Second, it could authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. If a statute did either one of these things, it was unconstitutional. The instant statute did both. &quot;Clear and significant&quot; violations of court orders was not defined with sufficient particularity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother claimed her son suffered neurological birth injuries and sued defendant doctor. The child's claim was referred to the Birth Related Neurological Injury Program and he qualified for compensation under the Birth Related Neurological Injury Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-5000 et seq. The mother claimed she sustained serious emotional distress from seeing her son's birth injuries. The doctor filed a demurrer and motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The exclusive remedy available to a child injured at birth and/or the parents, irrespective of the injury suffered, was compensation under the Birth Related Neurological Injury Act. The mother alleged that the exclusive remedy provision of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-5002(b) did not apply to her claim of emotional distress but the plain language of &sect; 38.2-5002(b) excluded recovery. While the mother challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 38.2-5002(b), it did not discriminate against women. A father was not precluded from witnessing injuries at birth simply because he was not physically connected to the infant. Section 38.2-5002(b), as applied, did not discriminate against a suspect class. Limiting remedies to those provided in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-5000 et seq. was reasonably related to the reduction of the cost of medical malpractice insurance and increasing the availability of medical care. The mother made no argument that the title of the relevant act given by the general assembly was misleading and unconstitutional, so the court did not discuss the constitutionality of the title assigned to the act by the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother moved to another state. After assuming physical custody of the mother's son, the grandmother sought assistance from the state child support enforcement unit. The grandmother was awarded public assistance for his care. Subsequently, the state child support enforcement unit issued an administrative support order, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 63.1-250.1 (Michie 1950), as amended, requiring the mother to pay a specified monthly amount in ongoing child support for the benefit of her son. Notice of the order was served on the mother by certified mail, as provided by statute. The return receipt bore the mother's signature. The mother did not contest the administrative support order. The state child support enforcement unit requested that the mother be held in contempt after she failed to pay the amount required. She contended the state child support enforcement unit did not have jurisdiction to enter the support order and that she did not receive appropriate service of process. The trial court found that the support order could be entered because that statute validly and constitutionally created personal jurisdiction over her, and that she was properly served with process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Various individuals alleged that legislative districts were gerrymandered on the basis of race, political affiliation, and gender, and that the districts were not comprised of contiguous and compact territory as mandated by Va.

The trial court found that certain legislative districts were not reasonably accessible to all other parts of the district without having to travel through one or more other districts. As such, the districts were neither contiguous nor compact as required by Va. Const. art. II, &sect; 6, and were therefore unconstitutional. Further, the majority-minority districts that were created were racially gerrymandered in violation of Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, as the Virginia General Assembly subordinated traditional redistricting principles to race in drawing district lines without achieving any compelling state interest or action that was narrowly tailored to fit a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a punitive damages award was a conclusion of law to be decided by the court rather than a factual determination to be made by a jury and, thus, plaintiff's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial was not violated by removing the issue of punitive damages from the jury. The court ruled that states possessed broad discretion with respect to punitive damages. This discretion was limited by the Fourteenth Amendment, which made the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the states. The Due Process Clause also prohibited states from imposing &quot;grossly excessive&quot; punishments on tortfeasors. Aside from these limitations, however, there was nothing barring jury awards of punitive damages. The Eighth Amendment was not violated by the fact that a jury, rather than the court, was allowed to consider punitive damages. The court also held that any evidence of insurance amounted to an inadmissible reference to insurance coverage and, that while defendant's net worth was relevant in determining punitive damages, insurance coverage was not an &quot;asset&quot; used in calculating net worth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and her spouse had petitioned the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission for benefits for their daughter pursuant to the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 38.2-5000 to -5021. The commissioner entered an order granting the parents' petition and directing the Virginia Birth-Related Compensation Fund to pay certain amounts allowable under the Act. The court held that, as the mother's emotional distress claim arose out of alleged medical malpractice during the labor and delivery of her baby, and was otherwise related to this alleged malpractice, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.02-5002(B) expressly precluded her claim. It rejected her argument that &sect; 38.02-5002(B) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution. Since the statute implicated neither a fundamental right nor a suspect classification, the court applied the rational basis level of scrutiny and found that the statute promoted a legitimate state purpose. It was enacted to remove the claims of neurologically injured infants from the tort system to decrease the cost of medical malpractice insurance premiums for all physicians.</SPAN></P>

The court found Virginia law, rather than that of the jurisdiction where he was encountered, governed his motion. He said his seizure violated the other jurisdiction's statutory laws against assault, stalking and kidnapping. Even if true, the statutes did not mandate the suppression of evidence seized during their violation. The temporary, consensual handcuffing did not make defendant's encounter a seizure. He was approached by one officer, in casual clothes, who displayed no weapon and used no threatening language. He was not seized, under U.S. Const. amend. IV, and his confession was not excludable as fruits of the poisonous tree. Defendant knew his Miranda rights, and his signature on a waiver form, albeit in the wrong place, expressly waived them. He was not coerced in any way, and was aware of what he was confessing to, so his confession was admissible under U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner argued that declaratory judgment did not lie because there was no actual controversy between the parties, as it was not a crime for the farmer to refuse entry under &sect; 3.1-399. The court held that the matter presented an adequate case or controversy that was ripe for declaratory judgment. While the farmer could not be prosecuted criminally for refusing future warrantless searches, the dismissal of the criminal charges did not completely remove the threat to the farmer of future warrantless searches. Nothing in &sect; 3.1-399 prevented the commissioner from conducting warrantless searches of the farmer's home in the future. The commissioner argued that because the farmer made goats' cheese in her home, she was subject to warrantless searches as she made and stored the cheese for sale. The court held that the manufacture and sale of goats' cheese was not a pervasively regulated industry and therefore, goats' cheese producer was not subject to a warrantless search. The farmer's industry did not meet the criteria for defining pervasive regulation where she was not required to obtain a license to make and sell goats' cheese or to keep detailed records of her business.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a demurrer to all claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to have land rezoned from agricultural/residential to residential. The court held that under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2285(F) (1997), a suit of this kind had to be brought against the &quot;governing body,&quot; which was the Board; all claims against the county failed. The Board's alleged failure to properly weigh and consider statutory concerns and its alleged discriminatory treatment would render its action arbitrary and capricious; therefore, the claim based on the alleged violation of Virginia law survived the demurrer. Plaintiffs' equal protection claim failed, as they did not allege facts showing that the Board's action was motivated, at least in part, by &quot;individually discriminatory&quot; intent. The claim that the Board unlawfully conditioned approval of the rezoning application upon &quot;impact fees&quot; for road improvement failed, as plaintiffs attached their proffers to their pleadings, and these proffers belied their argument as to the illegality and unconstitutional nature of the proffers. The substantive due process claim failed, as the complaint did not allege denial of rezoning was so unjustified as to be incapable of avoidance by procedural protections or state remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board contended that the owners of the property were precluded from being joined as parties, as the 30-day deadline for filing appeals under Va.

Section 15.2-2285(F) did not constitute either a statute of limitations or of repose and did not prohibit the joinder of additional necessary parties after the 30-day period for the filing of an appeal passed. The purchaser's claim for an arbitrary and capricious exercise of the Board's power to zone alleged sufficient facts to withstand a demurrer. The Board's demurrer to the other claims was sustained. The purchaser failed to allege an invidiously discriminatory intent by the Board to support its equal protection claim. The substantive due process claims failed, as the purchaser failed to allege that it had a property interest or that it was subjected to unjustifiable discrimination. The purchaser's claims for illegal exaction failed to state a basis upon which the purchaser had standing to assert the rights of others to attack the general transportation policies of the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer decided to build on an unusual site since the land at the center fell greatly as it reached the site's edges. Even so, the developer built the first phase to conform with existing zoning. The developer found the second phase required a variance for the 72-foot high structures being built to avoid having to build outward and cut down several trees. After the second phase work began, the developer also learned costly excavation problems would require revised plans. The developer asked city officials whether, within the existing variance, it could rotate its structures. The officials approved the change. However, a zoning administrator issued a stop-work order when the area residents protested. Because the first height variance was in question, the developer got a second height variance. After the zoning appeals board reversed the stop-work order and approved the second variance request, the trial court, on review, found the area residents did not meet their burden of showing the zoning appeals board applied erroneous principles of law or was plainly wrong in its decisions. It also found developers should be able to rely on city officials' approval of their plans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue for resolution was whether the operation of a day care center within a church was permitted in a zoning district authorizing churches but not day care centers. The decision of the BZA was presumed to be correct on appeal, and the church bore the burden of showing that the BZA applied erroneous principles of law or that its decision was plainly wrong and in violation of the purpose and intent of a zoning ordinance. The BZA argued that day care centers were not authorized in R-1 districts, day care centers were prohibited accessory uses, and accordingly, the decision of the BZA was neither plainly wrong nor based upon erroneous principles of law. The church argued that a day care facility was part of a church. &quot;Church&quot; was not defined in the King George County, Va., Zoning Ordinance. The court held that the day care center was not simply a baby-sitter; rather it was clear the facility was used for the instruction and education of the children who attended. The day care facility was viewed as an extension of the ministry of the church, and the church was entitled to enjoy the benefits of the property.</SPAN></P>

Very soon afterward the description was relayed to an officer in a nearby car who saw a matching subject approaching. He tried to stop him. The subject stopped and shot at the officer. Within a day of the robberies, the employees picked defendants photo from a lineup. Defendant admitted his actions. The out-of-court identifications had independent sources and were admissible. As defendant had not known of the safe in the back of the store when moving the manager back there, and as he had demanded the security video and that the phone cord be ripped out, he was guilty of detention beyond that necessary to rob the manager. It was inferable from defendant's actions that he shot with intent to kill the officer rather than with intent to escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to aggravated sexual battery upon his daughter, he was put on probation. One of the conditions of probation required him to submit to polygraph testing. When his probation officer requested permission to administer such a test, defendant filed an objection with the court. He argued that absent a grant of immunity, his privilege against self-incrimination precluded the court from requiring him to answer any questions during a polygraph test. The court disagreed, and denied his objection. The requirement of polygraph testing was reasonable, and defendant had no right, as a convicted felon, to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege concerning matters that affected his probationary status. Defendant did have the right to invoke the privilege if questioned about other criminal activity, as long as the requested information was incriminating, and there was a sufficient possibility of criminal prosecution. An invocation of the privilege under those circumstances could not subject him to probation revocation or other penalties. It would be up to the court to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether defendant was entitled to invoke the privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General District Court (Virginia) convicted defendant of driving while under the influence (DUI), second offense. The State also charged defendant with refusing to submit to a breath or blood test. Defendant appealed. The circuit court tried the case de novo. An issue was whether defendant's arrest was lawful under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-81, permitting an officer to make a warrantless arrest for a crime committed in his presence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city's officer saw defendant's car being operated erratically and transmitted that sighting to another city's officer who arrested defendant for DUI when he was outside his car filling it with gas. The warrantless arrest for DUI was unlawful under &sect; 19.2-81 since the offense, a misdemeanor, was not committed in the arresting officer's presence. The arrest was supported by probable cause and so it was not unconstitutional. Thus, the exclusionary rule for an unconstitutional arrest did not apply, and the court affirmed the DUI conviction. The remedy for &sect; 19.2-81 violation was not suppression of the arrest itself, at least absent prejudice to defendant. However, defendant was improperly charged with Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-268, refusing to submit to a breath or blood test, since he was not legally under arrest for DUI, since his arrest was in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-81. Therefore, when defendant was read his implied consent rights under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-268 (requiring defendant to have been lawfully arrested in order to be subject to &sect; 18.2-268's mandate to submit) his refusal to submit did not constitute a violation of &sect; 18.2-268.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found sufficient evidence to show a violation of the DUI law, found defendant guilty of DUI, and dismissed the refusal charge.</SPAN></P>

He was later found guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon after he reached the age of 18. Defendant appealed the conviction, alleging Va. Code &sect; 18.2-308.2 violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, because it created a classification based on age with no rational relationship to any legitimate government purpose and the statute was inconsistent because it classified the crime as a Class 6 felony yet imposed a two year minimum sentence. The court held that the statute survived rational basis review because drawing the line at the age of 29 for when a convicted felon could again possess a firearm was a classification rationally related to the asserted purpose of a public safety interest and the state's interests in establishing reasonable laws. Additionally, the mandatory sentencing provision was not inconsistent with its classification as a Class 6 felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council could close a public street as long as this power was exercised for the public welfare and not for the benefit of private interests. The closure of a portion of a public street to allow for the development of new homes and an increase in the tax base benefitted the public welfare, and the fact that a private developer might also profit was irrelevant since the overall purpose was in the public interest. The owners did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the ordinance closing the street was arbitrary or unreasonable. Closing the street was not a taking or damaging of private property for a public purpose, but, rather, was the abandonment of a public right, and no incidental or consequential damages were recoverable. The procedure for the city to process an application for a street closing was governed solely by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2006. Any inconsistency between the street closing and the city's master plan was not actionable, as any action contrary to that plan was deemed to be a modification of it, and the plan was not binding on the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured purchased a life insurance policy and named the alleged beneficiary, his wife, the beneficiary and his minor son the contingent beneficiary. The policy provided beneficiary designations were revocable unless the insured signed a form making the designation irrevocable. Thereafter, the insured divorced the alleged beneficiary and died a few years later. The alleged beneficiary then made a demand for payment under the policy. The insurance company refused to pay the proceeds to the alleged beneficiary, reasoning the divorce and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-111.1 entitled the minor to the proceeds because the insured had not made his beneficiary designation irrevocable. The trial court initially noted the parties' divorce changed the relationship within the operative terms of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-111.1 such that, when the insured died, the contingent beneficiary, the minor child, then became entitled to the policy proceeds. The trial court concluded the alleged beneficiary's rights as primary beneficiary were never vested, thus Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-111.1 did not unconstitutionally change the nature of the insurance contract, rendering her argument unmeritorious.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs also sought attorney's fees, costs, and interest on any refunds awarded. The case was before the court on respondent's plea to the jurisdiction of the court, plea of sovereign immunity, plea of the statute of limitations, and demurrer.

Defendant told the officer he was driving the other vehicle. The officer noted a mild odor of alcohol about defendant. Witnesses told the officer defendant ran a red light and struck the other vehicle. A police department policy required the officer to request a member of the accident reconstruction unit and to conduct no further investigation until that person arrived. The officer initially had a reasonable suspicion for detaining defendant. However, the officer did not diligently seek to confirm or dispel his suspicions about defendant in as short a time as was reasonably possible. The policy requiring him to conduct no further investigation while awaiting an accident reconstruction expert was unconstitutional as applied and could not be the basis of a lawful continued detention of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for unlawfully soliciting passengers in violation of Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA) Reg. 5.23. They appealed, arguing the MWAA was unconstitutionally created, and thus, any regulations adopted by it were void. Further, they argued there were no penalties for the charge of solicitation, or that such penalties were unconstitutionally vague. The court initially noted the MWAA was the creature of a congressionally sanctioned compact between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of Columbia; therefore, its provisions enjoyed supremacy over inconsistent state and constitutional mandates. The court held in construing the compact, it was required to examine the express terms of the agreement to determine whether the legislative grant to the compact agency exceeded state constitutional limitations. The court affirmed, holding the enactment of regulations governing the use of the airport property was a reasonable and necessary exercise of the powers granted the MWAA by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant inherited 21 lots in a subdivision with no public sewer lines. Respondent, the board of supervisors, approved the expansion of sewer service to include portions of the subdivision. Because they were undeveloped, complainant's lots were not included. Complainant alleged he had a right to a public sewer connection under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-300 (repealed 1997). Having been deprived of that right, he appealed under &sect; 15.1-303. Complainant alleged that respondent's actions deprived him of his U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV substantive due process and equal protection rights, and that he was entitled to recover under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Because respondent's actions did not result in the establishment of a sewer, those actions were not final and were not appealable. Complainant did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the reservation of sewer connection. Also, complainant was not entitled to damages, because the decision to allow only lots with existing dwelling units to reserve connection did not violate his rights.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant association amended its by-laws to discontinue membership in the swim club and applied to plaintiff county to withdraw its membership at the swim club. Plaintiff county refused and defendant association quit paying dues to the swim club. Plaintiff county filed suit to compel defendant property owners to continue their memberships at the swim club and defendant association filed a cross-bill which asserted the zoning conditions were void. The court rejected defendant association's argument that the proffered zoning violated Virginia statutory law. Property owners in defendant association waived any constitutional attack on the zoning amendment because the property developers requested the conditions and as the successors-in-interest to those developers, they were bound by the developers' original consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had presented evidence that his proposed rezoning to a residential area was a reasonable use of the land, because property surrounding the owner's parcel was zoned similarly. The board presented evidence that the owner's property bordered two large parcels that were zoned agricultural. The circuit court held that since the underlying zoning and the new zoning were both appropriate for the lot in question a classic case of a fairly debatable issue was presented. Thus, the board's decision to deny the owner's rezoning application was fairly debatable. The owner claimed that the board required a cash proffer or a dedication of public facilities from him as a condition precedent to the board's approval of the new zoning. The circuit court found that the board did not require a cash proffer or a dedication where fifty percent of all zoning applications were approved without the maximum proffer and that any and all proffers from zoning applicants were made voluntarily. The circuit court further held that the board's action did not constitute a taking where the owner could build a residence by obtaining a variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff agency moved for judgment seeking a final order validating certain conduit revenue bonds and certain proceedings relating to their authorization and issuance. Defendant taxpayers challenged constitutionality of issuance of these bonds as violating the Establishment of Religion Clauses in the U.S. Const. amend. I and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Industrial Development Authority sought an order validating conduit revenue bonds and connected proceedings, for the benefit of an accredited, non-profit, non-denominational Christian day school, to finance projects authorized by the Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-4900 et seq. Defendant taxpayers challenged its constitutionality under the Establishment of Religion Clauses in the state and federal constitutions. The court found denial of the bonds based on the school's alleged pervasively religious viewpoint would infringe its free speech rights. There was no Establishment Clause violation. The evidence did not prove the school was &quot;pervasively sectarian,&quot; and the proposed financing was assumed to relate to buildings and facilities within a properly delimited project. Lacking a compelling government interest, it would be impermissible viewpoint discrimination to deny validation under a broad neutral government program in which other church-affiliated institutions had taken part, solely on the basis of religious viewpoint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion for judgment was granted and issuance of conduit bonds and related proceedings were validated pursuant to statute. There was no state or federal constitutional violation, as the institution to receive funding did not have a primary purpose of religious training, was not pervasively sectarian, and it was not substantially subsumed by a religious mission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants filed declaratory judgment action against defendants Commonwealth and state bar association, and sought summary judgment declaring Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6.1-2.19 - 6.1-2.29, the Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act or CRESPA, unconstitutional for allowing non-lawyers to practice real estate law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant attorney, who had a real estate practice, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant state bar association and Commonwealth, challenging the practice of allowing non-lawyers to handle real estate closings and paperwork. After a hearing, the court permitted intervention as party plaintiff by a real estate attorneys league. Complainants sought a judgment declaring Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6.1-2.19 - 6.1-2.29, the Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act (CRESPA), unconstitutional. They argued CRESPA violated the Special Legislation clause of the Virginia Constitution, due process and equal protection rights, and the state separation of powers doctrine, and cited the Unauthorized Practice of Law Opinion No. 183. The court found for defendants, holding the Unauthorized Practice of Law Advisory Opinion No. 183 approved by the state Supreme Court exempted CRESPA licensed persons from such charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment entered for the Commonwealth, despite finding challenged legislation authorized non-lawyers to handle some real estate law, as those persons were shielded by judicial exemption. Special Legislation clause was not implicated. Complainant's status as real estate attorney did not implicate constitutional protection of relevant fundamental right nor equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company filed a motion requesting a trial, arguing Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-2231 (1994) was unconstitutional in that it deprived it of the right to file lawsuits in the Commonwealth of Virginia, its constitutional right to trial by jury, and its right to appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance carrier was subrogated to its insured's property damage claim and sued defendant insurance carrier to recover the amount of its payment to its insured and to recover its insured's deductible. Defendant argued plaintiff did not have a right to sue for damages because Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-2231 (1994) mandated arbitration of disputed liability and damage claims between insurers. Plaintiff argued Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-2231 (1994) was unconstitutional as it deprived it of the right to file lawsuits in the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia, it denied it its constitutional right to trial by jury, and denied it its right to appellate review. The court held Va. Const., art. I, &sect; 11 provided a guarantee of a trial by jury only to those who had a right to a jury trial at common law and that corporations had such rights at common law. The court granted plaintiff's request holding Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-2231 (1994) was contrary to those preserved rights and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial granted, because at common law corporations had the right to sue and be sued and as that right was afforded in the Virginia Constitution, the statute at issue was contrary to those preserved rights and was therefore unconstitutional, void, and of no force or effect.</SPAN></P>
