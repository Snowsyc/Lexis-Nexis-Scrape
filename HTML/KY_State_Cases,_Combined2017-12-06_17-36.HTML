</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of decision of Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board that affirmed the administrative law judge's determination that appellant's disability benefits for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome would terminate on her 65th birthday as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.730(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For more than 39 years, appellant worked as billing clerk for appellee employer. After appellant had surgery on both wrists for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, she was unable to return to work. When she was 60 years old, she was awarded total and permanent vocation disability benefits that would terminate on her 65th birthday. Before the court, appellant argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.730(4) was unconstitutional because it took her property and deprived her of due process of law. Court declined appellant's invitation to criticize state supreme court's reasoning and held that statute was constitutional to extent it required an off-set of workers' compensation benefits with social security benefits. Court opined that automatic termination of workers' compensation benefits on an employee's 65th birthday would fail to support the statute's rational basis, prevention of double-dipping. Court thought that statutory interpretation violated an employee's equal protection and due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision affirmed and case remanded for determination of appropriate reduction or termination of appellant's workers' compensation benefits based on amount of old-age social security benefits to which she will be entitled on her 65th birthday. Statute's requirement of dollar-for-dollar set-off of workers' compensation with social security benefits was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
