Codified Laws ch. 11-2 was beyond the scope of the objectors' writ because, if the county did not, the board had no jurisdiction to grant a CUP, since an ordinance designating an entity authorized to approve a CUP had to be adopted pursuant to S.D.

Codified Laws &sect; 22-30A-17. After he violated conditions of the agreement, the State again charged defendant with grand theft. The Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Sully County, South Dakota, denied defendant's motion for a jury trial. Defendant pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the portion of the agreement requiring him to plead guilty to grand theft was unconstitutional because it forced him to plead guilty to grand theft at a later arraignment if he violated the conditions of the agreement. The court agreed that the portion of the agreement requiring defendant to plead guilty to grand theft, which encompassed his waiver of his right to a jury trial, was unenforceable. Although defendant agreed to plead guilty to grand theft if he failed to satisfy the conditions of the agreement, he should have been able to withdraw from the portion of the agreement related to the grand theft charge until he entered a guilty plea on that charge. Defendant never voluntarily, of his own choice, entered a plea of guilty to grand theft. The circuit court erred in determining defendant was bound by that portion of the agreement and in subsequently denying his motion to exercise his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and sentence and remanded to the trial court to allow defendant to plead not guilty and invoke his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant's vehicle because he did not see the temporary license permit on the rear window. As he approached the driver, he shined his flashlight into the open rear passenger window and saw an open beer container. A DUI investigation ensued, and defendant was arrested. It was not until later during the stop that the officer noticed an unexpired temporary license permit in the lower right-hand corner of the vehicle's rear window. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the stop. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err when it ruled that the initial stop of the vehicle was based on reasonable and articulable suspicion that the vehicle was without a license. However, the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence gathered as a result of the stop. Because the officer observed the open beer bottle in the backseat area of the vehicle as he approached defendant, the officer had facts independent of the initial stop to justify a continued detention to investigate the new suspicion of criminal activity. His continued detention of defendant was neither unreasonably long nor unlawful in scope.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed what he believed was a failure to dim violation by defendant. The officer stopped the vehicle. Defendant stated that the lights were on their low-beam setting. Defendant demonstrated the lights by flashing them against a wall. The officer asked to see his driver's license. He informed the officer that he did not have a valid license. He was arrested for driving with a revoked license. A magistrate court denied his motion to suppress and found him guilty. The circuit court upheld the judgment. On review, the court found that when the officer requested defendant's driver's license, the officer had not yet completed his investigation of the failure to dim offense and, therefore, his request for the license was within the scope of the investigation attendant to the traffic stop. Defendant's admission that he did not have a driver's license provided reasonable suspicion that he was driving without a valid license. That provided additional reasonable suspicion to further extend the investigation in order to resolve the license issue. Thus, further reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, emerged during the stop making the duration of the stop reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree rape of a minor and possessing, manufacturing, or distributing child pornography. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court violated his right to a public trial because it excluded the public from the courtroom when the victim testified about the sexual abuse. The court found that the trial court's ruling primarily relied on the language of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-24-6, and it did not make specific findings as required by Waller and Delaney. The trial judge did not make specific findings on whether there was an overriding interest or substantial reason to justify total or partial closure. He also did not make specific findings about the breadth of the closure or the alternatives he considered in closing the courtroom. He did not address the factors supporting closure or partial closure for child sexual abuse victims. Defendant's rights could be fully protected by a remand. Defendant's email address and other personal information were obtained from an internet service provider via subpoenas issued by the State. Defendant provided his information to the provider and he had no legitimate expectation of privacy in that information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The essence of the accomplice's statement, that defendant shot the victim, remained consistent with his trial testimony, despite some inconsistent details. Even though a witness's testimony was inadmissible hearsay within hearsay that was offered to prove the truth of the statement, the trial court's error in admitting the testimony was harmless because numerous other witnesses testified that the victim was rumored to be a government informant. Another witness's testimony that a man, in the victim's presence, admitted killing an FBI agent, was not inadmissible hearsay under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 19-16-1(3) because the testimony was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to prove that the victim overheard the man make the highly self-incriminatory statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death by a trial court and did not appeal. The time to do so had expired. The state supreme court ordered that his execution be stayed and that a briefing schedule be established so it could fulfill the S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27A-12 requirement that it consider the propriety of that sentence, as contemplated by that statute's three inquiries. Defendant moved to vacate the stay and briefing orders. The state supreme court declined to do so. It found that S.D. Const. art. V, &sect; 5 granted the state supreme court appellate jurisdiction as provided for by the Legislature, which include review of death sentences pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27A-9. It also found that his request was not required by the plain language of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27A-21, barring judges from staying executions, since state supreme court members were justices and not judges, and it had the authority to stay appellate proceedings. Too, it found that without the authority to stay a death penalty case, that punishment could occur before the state supreme court had fulfilled its mandatory-review requirement, which would be absurd if it was found that relief was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court granted expungement for two misdemeanor offenses, the State filed an appeal. In reversing, the supreme court determined that, even though the South Dakota Legislature broadly defined &quot;expungement,&quot; the statutory scheme could not have been read to give courts broad jurisdiction to grant expungement. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-3-30 did not grant jurisdiction; rather, it provided the standard to be applied by the court in determining if expungement was appropriate. The standard was only reached if there was authority to act under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-3-27. The fact that the word &quot;conviction&quot; was removed in the legislative history of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-3-27 added further supported for the decision in this case. Subsequent legislative history did not override a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Moreover, the pardon power was not differentiated from the effect of an expungement. As a result, the expungement statutes did not apply to convictions, and the conviction pardoning power remained solely reserved for the Governor of South Dakota.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first faction and second faction of defendant nonprofit religious corporation engaged in a continuing struggle over which church group to join to provide them with church leadership. The second faction sought to excommunicate members of the first faction and disenroll them as members of the corporation. The ongoing disputes over corporate governance and leadership sparked two lawsuits. The first faction then sued to dissolve the religious corporation and requested the appointment of a receiver. The trial court denied the second faction's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and found that the dispute caused the religious corporation to be unable to fulfill its corporate purpose. Accordingly, it ordered S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 47-26-22 dissolution as well as appointment of a receiver to divide the corporate property among the corporate members. The state supreme court found that the case should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It determined that the underlying religious controversies over church leadership so pervaded the dissolution of the religious corporation that dissolution was beyond a secular court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court ruled that state law preempted the ordinance. The court observed that S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 25 specifically provided that gambling was to be regulated by the state. Pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-7A-2, lottery management and control rested solely with the state, and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-29-5 expressly stated that municipalities could not suppress lotteries owned and operated by the state. The regulatory objective set forth in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-7A-56, the state's consideration of proposed locations pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-7A-57, and the limited power given to municipalities by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-7A-64 all indicated that the Legislature left no room for supplementary regulation of video lottery by municipalities. Thus, the city's zoning authority under S.D. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-19-3 did not extend to regulating placement of video lottery machines.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiffs' evidence raised serious questions about whether the state aid formula was based on actual costs and whether local taxing procedures and caps might have constitutional implications. The plaintiffs showed that some groups of students were not achieving at desired levels and that some districts struggle to provide adequate facilities and qualified teachers.

A comprehensive reassessment plan that afforded the county a reasonable time within which to complete a reassessment did not violate the Constitution.  Property owners did not allege that the county made anything less than a good-faith effort to complete the reassessment as soon as was practicably possible. Although the reassessment plan created a temporary lack of uniform taxation within the county, it also eliminated it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that the City's administrative appeals process afforded the owner an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The supreme court disagreed. The City issued the owner four citations for the concrete extension to his driveway and was therefore required to carry the appropriate burden of proof. Yet the owner, in his first and only hearing on the factual basis of the citations, was charged with the difficult task of overcoming the initial determination of non-compliance. That difficulty was compounded by the fact that the owner was not afforded an opportunity to subpoena witnesses or documents or to otherwise investigate the basis for the citations. Because the hearing examiner did not hold the City to its burden of proof, the City's administrative appeals process deprived the owner of a protected property interest without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit Minnehaha County, South Dakota, found defendant guilty of two counts of loitering in a community safety zone, in violation of S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 22-24B-22 and 22-24B-24 were not unconstitutionally vague because 1) S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24B-24 only applied to persons required to register as sex offenders in South Dakota, a meticulously defined class of individuals; 2) by defining the term &quot;community safety zone,&quot; S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24B-22 described the precise area to which S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24B-24 applied, and did not use amorphous terms like &quot;neighborhood&quot; or &quot;locality,&quot; which were elastic and dependent upon the circumstances; and 3) S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24B-24 distinguished between innocent and harmful conduct. By requiring that the loitering be for the primary purpose of observing or contacting minors, the legislature limited S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24B-24's application to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect. Because S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 22-24B-22 and 22-24B-24 were sufficient to provide defendant with notice that his conduct was prohibited, and they did not authorize the law enforcement officers to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner, defendant failed to show that the statutes, as applied to him, were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his license application, the taxidermist agreed that he would keep records of his taxidermy activities and that he would make the records available for inspection by authorized state officers during normal business hours. When a state conservation officer visited his workshop during normal business hours and requested to see his taxidermy records, he refused. The court held that the requirement to produce business records did not violate the taxidermist's Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, right to be free from unreasonable searches because he had no actual subjective expectation of privacy in the records. Moreover, the records inspection authorized by &sect; 41-6-33 was objectively reasonable because the business of taxidermy was closely regulated and the statute satisfied the criteria set forth in the case law governing warrantless administrative inspections. Such inspections were necessary for effective enforcement of the regulatory scheme and protection of wildlife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court declared S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 25-5-29 and 25-5-30&nbsp;unconstitutional because they contained no requirement for a finding of parental unfitness prior to awarding custody to a non-parent. The supreme court disagreed. The circuit court did not enter findings of fact or consider whether the statutes at issue were capable of constitutional interpretation or application. The supreme court held that &sect;&sect; 25-5-29 and 25-5-30 could be interpreted and applied without offending the constitutional protections outlined in Troxel v. Granville. Section 25-5-29 required that it be presumed to be in the best interest of a child to be in the care, custody, and control of the child's parent. Only when parental unfitness or &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; were present could this presumption be rebutted. S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 25-5-29 and 25-5-30 could be construed constitutionally because these statutes required that &quot;special weight&quot; be given to a fit parent's decisions regarding her child. As a result, Mother has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that &sect;&sect; 25-5-29 and 25-5-30 &quot;clearly, palpably and plainly&quot; violated the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court accepted the conditional guilty plea. However, the court concluded that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to accept defendant's conditional plea.

At issue in this case was whether the Attorney General's ballot explanation complied with the requirements set forth in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12-13-9. The union contended that the Attorney General's explanation failed to provide an objective, clear, and simple summary to educate the voters of the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment. The court concluded that the trial court was correct in concluding that the Attorney General did not abuse his discretion in his drafting of the ballot explanation. The Attorney General's explanation offered an objective summary of the language of the proposed amendment that educated the voters of its purpose and effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County and the landowners could not agree on the value of the acreage condemned. The County filed a motion for partial summary judgment to preclude the landowners from introducing evidence and testimony regarding the effects of landing and takeoff height restrictions on the remainder of the adjacent land. The County did not enact landing and takeoff height restriction ordinances at the time the condemnation petition was filed but could have been required to do so by the Federal Aviation Administration. The landowners sought to introduce evidence of additional height restrictions that could be imposed if the airport were to expand to permit other types of aircraft operations. The trial court granted the County's motion. The court held that the landowners received just compensation because all that the trial court's order precluded was a claim for possible future airspace intrusion for which no plans, airport authority resolution, or condemnation petition currently exist. The trial court's decision was modified to acknowledge that if the County attempted to impose height restrictions that the landowners were not barred by res judicata from bringing a new takings claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his due process rights were violated, which rendered his plea involuntary, when the trial court failed to establish an adequate factual basis for his plea to intentional damage to property in the first degree. The court disagreed because the colloquy between defendant and the circuit judge confirmed defendant's design to damage a vehicle. He confirmed that he intentionally drove his van through an area closed by the police agent's car in his attempt to escape, which was the injurious act that caused the damage. The court found that the act was intentional. Additionally, the trial court produced an adequate factual basis for accepting the plea despite defendant's equivocations that made it difficult for the trial court to properly establish a factual basis for the crime. It was further determined that the trial court did not violate defendant's due process rights by sentencing him to one year longer on each count than he originally received prior to appealing the case. At the second sentencing the trial court set out in detail the reasons for the sentence and left no indication that the increased sentence was punishment for appealing the original conviction.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 25-4-52 was unconstitutional because the circuit court was not required to consider whether visitation would significantly interfere with their parent-child relationship. The supreme court agreed that the statute was unconstitutional as applied. The circuit court concluded that the parents' opposition was unreasonable and not in the best interests of the children, but did not investigate or apply the &quot;special weight&quot; and &quot;special factors&quot; analysis required by the United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville. Nothing in the circuit court's written findings or conclusions indicated that the circuit court gave any special weight to the parents' decision, although in its oral comments the court mentioned several times that the parents' decision merited deference and special weight. The circuit court's observations improperly placed the onus on the parents to show why their decision should be honored instead of allocating the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence to the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

Lacking any authority under which to detain defendant, his further detention under the citizen's arrest statute was an illegal arrest. The police officer who arrived likely had limits on his authority to arrest defendant without a warrant; specifically, S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an Oglala Sioux Tribe member and his oil and gas company, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County, South Dakota, which affirmed an order of appellee South Dakota Department of Revenue and Regulation denying the member's motion for leave to amend his tax refund claims to include his tribe member customers as a class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was the third appeal in the case. The original case determined that the South Dakota motor fuel taxes were illegally collected from the company and that the company's consumers who were enrolled members of the tribe were entitled to the bulk of the refund. Here, the member sought to certify the tribes' members as a class in order to collect the refunds. Because class actions were not expressly permitted under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-59-1, 10-59-17, and 10-47B-131.2, South Dakota had not waived its sovereign immunity for a class action refund lawsuit. The motor fuel tax refund statutes provided no authority for class action claims to recover illegal taxes; rather, those statutes specifically required that each individual taxpayer file a claim with the Secretary of the Department. Absent individual claims, the circuit court was without jurisdiction. For that reason, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-23 was not applicable via S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-26-32.1. Therefore, neither S.D. Codified Laws ch. 1-26 nor S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-59 authorized class action claims against the State and did not waive sovereign immunity to such an extent as to allow class actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telecommunications company sought a refund for an overpayment of tax from appellee South Dakota Department of Revenue and Regulation (Department), which was denied. On review, the Office of the Hearing Examiner (OHE) recommended that the company's appeal be denied, and the Department's Secretary dismissed the appeal. The Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Hughes County, South Dakota, affirmed and the company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department argued that because the payment-under-protest system in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-27-2 was the exclusive method of obtaining a tax refund it was without jurisdiction to hear the company's administrative appeal of the denial of its refund request filed under S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-59. The court disagreed. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-59-1 authorized several types of tax matters that might have been heard by the OHE as an administrative appeal and it used no language of exclusion or inclusion that served to indicate only those taxes specifically listed might have been appealed via its administrative appeals process. Therefore, &sect; 10-59-1 did not limit the S.D. Codified Laws ch. 1-26 administrative appeals process to those tax matters specifically listed. Nothing in &sect; 10-59-1 precluded the defining of a particular type of fee, tax, licensure, or registration requirement as a contested case in a specific statute while not including another in that same statute. Therefore, the lack of reference to the telecommunication gross receipts tax, S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-33A, in &sect; 10-59-1 did not preclude an administrative appeal of a refund request for an allegedly overpaid tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit Moody County (South Dakota), which denied his motion to dismiss the charges against him and found defendant guilty in a bench trial of simple assault in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-18-1(2). The charge arose from defendant's altercation with a woman at her house after the two had spent the night drinking together.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted self-defense, claiming that the woman attacked him. He was arrested without a warrant and jailed. He was not given an opportunity to have scratches, redness, and a bite mark on his body photographed. Defendant was held for 18 days without a judicial determination of probable cause, in violation of South Dakota law and the United States Constitution. The circuit court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges, but it gave him a presumption at trial that his evidence of self defense would have been beneficial to him. The court overturned the conviction. Although S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-4-1 only required persons arrested to be brought before a committing magistrate without unnecessary delay, those arrested without a warrant were constitutionally entitled to a judicial determination of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest. When this did not occur, the State bore the burden of proving that the delay was not unreasonable. Dismissal of criminal charges would be warranted in cases of egregious prosecutorial misconduct or on a showing of prejudice or a substantial threat thereof, or irremediable harm to the defendant's opportunity to obtain a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded the case for the circuit court to consider whether the State had a bona fide emergency or extraordinary circumstance justifying the unreasonable delay. If no adequate justification could be shown, the circuit court had to determine if defendant's opportunity to obtain a fair trial was prejudiced by the delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third Judicial Circuit, Lake County, South Dakota, ruled that defendant's no contest plea was voluntary, intelligent and knowing; that he received effective assistance of counsel; and that denial of a firearms expert did not violate his constitutional rights. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the prior advisement of rights did not relieve the sentencing court of its obligation to inquire into and determine that defendant's plea was voluntary. The sentencing court failed to make critical inquiries and determinations when the inquiries were most significant--when defendant changes his not guilty plea to a plea of no contest. The voluntariness of a plea was of the utmost importance when an accused entered a guilty or no contest plea. No inquiry was made by the sentencing court to determine if the plea was coerced or influenced by threats or promises. The record failed to establish that defendant voluntarily entered his plea of no contest, and that he waived his constitutional rights against self-incrimination, to confront witnesses, and to a jury trial as set forth in Boykin. The habeas court had no basis on a silent record from the sentencing court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the plea was voluntary and was a waiver of constitutional rights when it was entered. The habeas court erred in concluding that defendant voluntarily entered his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the habeas court with direction to void the plea and remand to the sentencing court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit Lawrence County, South Dakota, denying his application for writ of habeas corpus that, among other things, raised the issue of whether his waiver of his right to have a jury determine the death penalty was constitutionally valid. Defendant had pleaded guilty to first-degree felony murder, kidnapping, and other offenses, and was sentenced to death by a judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to have a jury make the death penalty determination. He specifically pointed to the judge's failure to clarify that a jury would have to unanimously sentence him to death, and that if one juror voted against the death penalty, he would receive a life sentence. After finding that the verbatim record of the judge's explanation supported defendant's claim, the court held that defendant did not validly waive his right to have a jury determine the death penalty. Even if defendant's lawyers had explained the unanimity requirement to him before he entered his plea, the judge's explanation, at least, would have been confusing and, at most, in direct contradiction. Consequently, without an adequate explanation by the judge that one juror could, in effect, choose life, defendant's waiver of a jury trial on the death penalty could not be considered knowing or voluntary. The court emphasized that it was not holding that the death penalty was unconstitutional. Rather, it determined that defendant's waiver of his right to jury trial was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's death sentence and remanded the matter for a new sentencing proceeding that afforded defendant the right to have a jury decide whether the death penalty should be imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ruled that the school districts did not have authority to finance the litigation. The court observed that the school districts' interest in discharging their constitutional duty was not simply based on their status as representatives of constituent students and taxpayers. In their constitutional challenge, the school districts were not mere creatures of statute. Instead, they were creations of the South Dakota Constitution via S.D. Const. art. VIII. Because of the constitutional provisions and the vital position school districts held as beneficiaries and recipients of public K-12 education funding, the court recognized that school districts had standing to challenge the constitutionality of K-12 public school funding in the limited context of a declaratory judgment action. Because the school districts had standing to sue the state officials at the current stage of the proceeding, it followed that the school districts also had authority to expend funds to support the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, foreign insurers, notified the South Dakota Department of Revenue and Regulation that they believed that certain provisions of the South Dakota Tax Code were unconstitutional and that they were paying taxes in protest. At an administrative hearing on the matter, the taxpayers' claims were found to be barred due to their failure to comply with procedural notice requirements in the &quot;protest and suit&quot; tax statutes. The trial court awarded summary judgment to defendants in the taxpayers' action. On appeal, the court found that as the exclusive methods for receiving a refund were not complied with, no refund was available to the taxpayers. The taxpayers had a meaningful opportunity to challenge the payments at the time they were made, but did not comply with the required procedures in S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 10-27-2, 10-55-3, and 10-55-4. Because no refund was available to the taxpayers, the declaratory judgment claim sought only the bare relief of having the tax statutes declared unconstitutional. As the tax statutes had been ineffective for nearly 30 years, there was no live or ongoing controversy. Thus, in the absence of a live controversy, the claims were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the county as a highway superintendent and, in that capacity, purchased new highway equipment without new tires or cutting edges. The employee claimed that he was saving money for the county by using the better quality tires and cutting blades off old machines. The supervisor reported the practice to a county commission, which determined that the employee had not complied with proper county bidding practices. The employee was asked to resign. The employee and other co-employees circulated a petition to have the supervisor removed. The supervisor wrote a letter to the editor regarding the matter. The court held that the trial court did not err in granting the summary judgment, under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-56(c). The employee was a public figure because he injected himself into a public controversy through the petition to oust the supervisor.

Appellant filed a habeas corpus action, contending he received ineffective assistance based on counsel's failure to adequately consult with him concerning his right to appeal. Appellant claimed he would have appealed if he had been adequately advised of that right. The Supreme Court of South Dakota held that counsel was constitutionally deficient in failing to adequately consult with appellant concerning an appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, Brookings County, South Dakota, that convicted him of disorderly conduct under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-18-35(2) for yelling profanities at a passing police car, arguing that his utterances were protected speech under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The State argued that the utterances fell under the fighting words exception to First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After city bars closed for the evening, bar patrons, including defendant, were gathered on the sidewalks outside of the bars when a patrol car drove by. Seeing the police, defendant spewed profanities at them. The officers stopped their vehicle, arrested defendant, and charged him with disorderly conduct. On review of defendant's conviction, the court held that defendant's speech was protected under the First Amendment. In order for speech to fall with the fighting words exception, the words, by their very utterance, must have a tendency to incite an immediate breach of the peace under the circumstances of the case. Defendant's words did not meet this exception. In fact, the crowd around defendant merely responded with facial expressions of disbelief. Merely because some may have been offended, annoyed, or even angered by defendant's words did not make them fighting words. As offensive or abusive as defendant's invective to the police may have been, his words, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, were not inherently likely to provoke a violent reaction. As such, the circuit court erred in concluding that defendant's utterances were unprotected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother appealed the circuit court's award of visitation to the nonparent and the supreme court affirmed, stating that the circuit court found extraordinary circumstances for an award of visitation to a nonparent. A birth certificate was issued reflecting the nonparent's surname after the mother and nonparent executed a sworn acknowledgment of paternity expressly indicating that the nonparent was the child's biological father. He commenced an action seeking legal and physical custody of the child, but a DNA test indicated that he was not the biological father. The mother had never supported or been the caretaker of her child. Thus, there was no substantial dispute with the finding that the nonparent served as the primary caretaker for the minor child since the time of her birth. That finding alone was sufficient to rebut the mother's presumptive rights as a parent under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 25-5-29(4) and 25-5-30(3). There was also no real dispute with the finding that the nonparent closely bonded as a parental figure with the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, who was 15, admitted to committing two first degree rapes. On appeal, the court noted that under &sect; 22-24B-2 the juvenile would remain on the sex offender registry for life. The court noted that adults who committed the same offense were able to have their names removed from the registry if they obtained a suspended imposition of the sentence. There was no equivalent for juvenile offenders. The court concluded that under the Equal Protection Clauses embodied in U.S. Const. amend. XIV and in S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18 the juvenile, and others similarly situated were denied equal protection. There was no legitimate legislative purpose rationally related to treating juvenile sex offenders convicted of the same crimes as adult sex offenders differently and more harshly than the adult sex offenders. In its examination of the sex offender registry scheme and its disparate treatment of juvenile offenders, the court could not conceive of any state of facts to suggest a rational basis for the harsher treatment of juveniles. Thus, to the extent that &sect; 22-24B-2 required the juvenile and other in the same situation to register, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The inmate asserted claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985. He also asserted numerous state law claims. The Circuit Court for Minnehaha County, South Dakota, dismissed for failure to state a claim. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All claims arose out of the contracts of the food supply corporation and food contractor with the State to provide food at the penitentiary. The inmate alleged that the food supply corporation and the food contractor both supplied bread that was not only non-certified as kosher, but was non-kosher. At issue was whether the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-8(a) required a showing that the pleader was entitled to relief. The supreme court concluded that the inmate's federal claims against the food supply corporation was untimely because they were filed more than four years after food services were provided. Also, the inmate failed to identify which provisions of federal or state constitutions were violated, rendering his complaint as to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was deficient. As to the inmate's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985, the inmate failed to allege any facts necessary to even infer a meeting of minds or mutual understanding. Nevertheless, the inmate did state a sufficient claim of deceit, under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 20-10-1, because the inmate's averments were specific.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's dismissal of the inmate's federal claims was affirmed.

He claimed that the kosher food provided by the contractor averaged fewer calories that the minimum required under the State's contract and that the food did not meet the dictates of his religious beliefs. The court held that the contract at issue was a public contract between the State and the contractor, and that the contract did not expressly indicate that it was intended for the inmate's direct benefit or enforcement. On the contrary the contract reflected that it was made for the express benefit of the State and the collective benefit that inmates could receive was only incidental to that of the State. Accordingly, under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 53-2-6, the inmate could not recover as a third-party beneficiary. The inmate's &sect; 1981 claim failed because the claim was based on religion, not on race. In addition, the inmate's &sect; 1985 claim failed because he failed to alleged that defendants directed themselves toward an unconstitutional action by virtue of a mutual understanding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a foreign insurance company, brought an action against defendant State in the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County, South Dakota, asserting that South Dakota's taxing method unconstitutionally favored domestic insurers. After a trial, the circuit court declared S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 10-44-2 and 10-44-4 through 10-44-6 unconstitutional from 1970 to the present. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">South Dakota's past tax scheme had different tax rates for domestic and foreign insurers. In 1981, the foreign insurer had filed for a refund, claiming that the different rates violated equal protection. The claim was denied because the insurer failed to comply with statutory requirements, but appeals were stayed as the U.S. Supreme Court considered the equal protection question. Such tax schemes were struck down in 1982, and the offending legislation was repealed. The court refused to consider the constitutionality of the former 1970-1981 statutes as there was no justiciable controversy. The insurer next challenged the requirements of S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 58-5-93 and 10-44-4, arguing that because a domestic company was required to locate its principal place of business in the state, a domestic company had to do nothing to receive a lower tax, but a foreign insurer was required to take the affirmative step of establishing a principal office in the state to receive the same tax. The court found that there was no disparate treatment when both types of insurers were required to do the same action, maintain an office in South Dakota, to obtain a credit on their tax obligation.</SPAN></P>

The United States District Court, District of South Dakota, Southern Division, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, certified one question to the South Dakota Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was arrested and charged with third offense driving under the influence. The deceased's physical condition deteriorated, and he was transported to a hospital where he later died. Defendants asserted that they were immune from claims of liability under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 3-21-8 and 3-21-9. Plaintiffs argued that defendants, who had liability coverage in effect at the time in question, waived their immunity to the extent of that coverage was provided under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-32A-1. The following certified question of the district court was accepted: does a county's purchase of liability insurance or participation in a risk sharing pool, pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-32A-1, waive the county's and its employees' immunity granted by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 3-21-8 and 3-21-9 to the extent of such insurance or participation in a risk sharing pool? The reviewing court held that because immunity in the specific area of the operation and maintenance of jails and correctional facilities, and administration of prisoner release was created through legislative enactment of S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 3-21-8 and 3-21-9, the general, common law waiver provisions did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that even though the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing one of two interpreters, because it entered no findings and made no statement for the record as to defendant's English competency, and the court found no independent evidentiary support justifying the dismissal, the error was not reversible because defendant did not show that he was unduly prejudiced. The trial court extended an offer to stop the proceedings at any time defendant or his counsel felt the need to confer, but neither made such a request. The trial court also erred by not having the interpreter translate the generic preliminary instructions at the time they were given to the jury, but defendant failed to show any prejudice conceivable affecting the outcome of the jury's verdict, and therefore there was no plain error. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that if defendant was permitted to elicit testimony from a police officer as to a witness's admissions that she was a drug dealer and would fail a urine test, the State would be permitted to elicit the officer's testimony as to the witness's remarks inculpating defendant in drug distribution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although divorced, the decedent did not change the beneficiary of her retirement plan. Neither the divorce decree nor the associated findings of fact and conclusions of law made any reference to the retirement plan. The circuit court concluded that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29A-2-804 automatically revoked the beneficiary designation, that &sect; 29A-2-804 did not violate the Contract Clause, S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 12, and that plaintiff was the lawful beneficiary of the decedent's retirement account. On appeal, the court found that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 29A-2-804 was a rule of construction that applied to the retirement plan. Defendant failed to show that the decedent's inaction was a clear indication of her intent to have defendant remain the beneficiary. The retroactive application of &sect; 29A-2-804 did not violate the Contract Clause. As a beneficiary, defendant merely has an expectation interest, not a vested interested. Furthermore, it did not impose a substantial restriction because the decedent could have still named defendant as the beneficiary, and it served significant and legitimate public purposes.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Hughes County, South Dakota denied the application. The newspaper appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED) was within the South Dakota Department of Tourism and State Development. The Department and GOED annually conducted an invitational hunt to showcase the state to businesses and entrepreneurs with the potential to locate new businesses or expand existing businesses within or into the state. At issue was a question of statutory construction. The newspaper claimed that the invitation list was a public record open to inspection under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-27-1 and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-26-2. Further, it argued that the agency's specific statutes,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-33-19.2 and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-52-3.4, did not give the Secretary discretion to refuse to allow public inspection. The newspaper also asserted that executive privilege did not apply to the invitation list. The supreme court concluded that the remedy sought by the newspaper was with the legislature to determine. There was no statutory provision which created a clear and unequivocal duty for the Secretary to make the invitation list available to the public. Absent such a duty, mandamus was not appropriate. The constitutional issue was not addressed.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of Minnehaha County, South Dakota, found there was no right to a jury trial in a forfeiture action and denied the request.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car was allegedly seized because it had been used to transport, possess, or conceal controlled drugs or substances. The owner was the registered owner of the car; however, the complaint alleged the true owner was her son. On appeal, the sole issue presented was whether S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 provided for a jury trial in civil forfeiture actions. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34-20B-88 was determined to be unconstitutional because a civil forfeiture proceeding was not an action in equity. Historically, civil forfeitures had been found to be proceedings at common law. As proceedings at law, the right to a jury trial existed at common law. The right to a jury trial pursuant to U.S. Const. VII was not applicable to the states, but the underlying rationale and analysis was helpful. Mere inconvenience for the State was an insufficient reason for denying a traditional and substantial constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the constitutionality of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-8-45(1), the statute making his conduct a criminal offense. Defendant contended the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague because the language could be construed to apply to a passenger's use of a boat, and no reasonable person would expect such conduct to constitute a crime. The supreme court disagreed, finding first that because the statute not only prohibited the use, but also the navigation of a boat, it could not be said that it was impermissibly vague in all applications. After all, no citation of authority was necessary to sustain the proposition that the State could validly prohibit the navigation or operation of boats and motor vehicles in public places while impaired. Therefore, defendant had no viable claim of facial unconstitutionality. This left him with the sole claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied. However, defendant's &quot;as applied&quot; claim was waived by the entry of his guilty plea. And even if defendant's &quot;as applied&quot; challenge had not been waived by his plea, he waived it by failing to present an adequate factual record of the conduct at issue.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners' proposal would circumvent the constitutional protection enacted in S.D. Codified Laws ch. 11-2. Because one of the basic limitations on the right of initiative was that the proposed ordinance or amendment had to be within the power of the county board to adopt, petitioners' proposed use of initiatives could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners purchased a residence. An anchor pole and guy wires on the property provided support for a pole located on the opposite side of the street. The anchor pole and guy wires were on the property at the time of property owners' purchase. The property owner objected to the placement of a wooden stake on their property for additional guy wires. The power company acknowledged that no easement or license had been filed with the register of deeds. Nevertheless, the power company argued that the property owners lacked standing. The property owners contended that Section 310 of the Rules and Regulations Covering Electric Service filed by the power company with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission was unconstitutional because it provided for a taking without compensation. The placement of the anchor pole on the property owners' property was indefinite and likely to continue indefinitely. Moreover, the anchor pole and guy wires were placed on the property before the property owners' purchase of the property. Any cause of action for inverse condemnation belonged to the prior owner and the property owners lacked standing to maintain an action for the taking.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to eight years for each of the five offenses charged. He was not sentenced to forty years for one felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The last of several measures undertaken to repeal the video lottery was the instant initiative at issue.

Codified Law ch. 10-33A Upon Wireless Telecommunications Services.&quot; The supreme court was called upon to reconsider that portion of its writing in an earlier opinion that suggested that an initiative could not be used to repeal an existing law. The attorney general advised the secretary of state that the initiated measures were not permissible uses of the constitutional power of initiative, under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The supreme court concluded, however, that the people's power to propose measures included the power to propose repeal of existing laws. There was no blurring of the distinction between the initiative and referendum or the ability to nullify pursuant to the referendum provision of article III, &sect; 1. The sponsors demonstrated that they had a clear legal right to have each initiated measure placed on the ballot. To that extent, the supreme court overruled its earlier opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that his Due Process rights were violated as the protection order issued against him under S.D. Codified Laws ch. 25-10 did not give notice that a violation of the order could subject him to penalties under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&nbsp;22-19A-2 for a Class 6 felony. The Supreme Court of South Dakota held that defendant was given notice by the language contained in the protection order that it was a criminal offense to violate the order by contacting his former girlfriend or her family in any manner. The protection order was clear on its face that any and all contact by defendant was a violation of the order and a criminal offense. Inter alia, defendant repeatedly contacted his girlfriend by telephone over a 12-hour time period on December 5 and 6, 2001. Twenty-six calls were placed from a cellular telephone owned by defendant's father and to which defendant had access. Despite the prohibition, defendant repeatedly contacted his former girlfriend&nbsp;by telephone and berated and threatened her for dating another man. The course of conduct he engaged in violated the protection order and met the definition of stalking as provided in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-19A-1(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion for paternity testing. The supreme court disagreed. The issue of paternity could have been raised in the prior proceeding for child support, but was not. Therefore, it was res judicata and the trial court did not err when it held as a matter of law that the husband's motion for paternity testing was barred. The husband also argued that the statute of limitations did not bar the paternity petition. However, the husband failed to contest paternity until almost three years after the child's birth, which was more than sixty days after the creation of the presumption. The language of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-59 was clear that the date of creation of a presumption of paternity when a child was born in wedlock was the earlier of two possible dates: the child's date of birth or the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child. Therefore, the statute of limitations barred the husband's request for paternity testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual knocked on the door of a residence where officers were executing a search warrant. Because he was on federal probation, he was required to submit to a search of his vehicle outside the residence. Methamphetamine was found therein, and he eventually entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanor. Thereafter, the State filed an action seeking forfeiture under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34-20B-70. The circuit court found that the seizure was grossly disproportionate, and the State sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the amount of the forfeiture was required to bear a relationship to the gravity of the offense it was designed to punish. The analysis should have been made between the value of the property and the severity of the offense as viewed by the legislature, not the actual sanction imposed. The circuit court should have considered the entire circumstances. The circuit court erred in limiting its analysis to the fine for the misdemeanor charge when assessing gross disproportionality. An assessment of all the relevant factors in this situation did not suggest that the forfeiture was grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The Department of Social Services (DSS) approved the proposed intervenors as an adoptive family along with two other families but ultimately recommended adoptive placement with a nonrelative family. The nonrelative foster family sought to adopt the grandniece. The issue on appeal was whether a relative approved by DSS for placement could intervene as a matter of right and challenge the agency's proposed adoptive placement with unrelated foster parents. The court decided that a relative did not have that right. It noted that the legislature had not amended the adoption laws to allow relatives the right to intervene until the year after the proposed intervenors' case was filed and decided. The court noted that the proposed intervenors could not rely on a policy espoused in an internal DSS manual to give them a legally protectable interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others kidnapped and killed the victim in order to steal from his home. The victim was beaten, stabbed, and tortured. Defendant failed to show prosecutorial misconduct based on a violation of an order requiring plea bargain disclosure because nothing indicated that the State negotiated an inmate witness's early release in exchange for his testimony. Aggravating factors of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27A-1(3), (6), and (9), were present where defendant and the others killed the victim in order to steal from him and to eliminate a police messenger. Depravity of mind was shown by the torture and defendant's laughing throughout the torture. Also, the death sentence was not disproportionate to other relevant cases, considering the nature of the criminal actions. The court rejected as unconstitutional any reading of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 23A-27A that would have prevented a capital defendant from having the opportunity to have a sentencing hearing before a jury. Defendant specifically asked to be sentenced by the circuit court, thereby waiving his constitutional right to have a jury determine whether the aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The evidence showed that defendant participated in taking the victim's property both during and after killing the victim. Defendant debated the relative methods of killing the victim in front of the conscious victim, including slitting his throat. Defendant made the victim drink a mixture of pills, beer, and hydrochloric acid, kicked him in the head numerous times with great force, forced the victim to lie naked in the snow and in an ice-cold creek for an extended period of time, and dropped numerous heavy stones on the victim's head before the victim died. In addition, the transporting of the victim to a remote area in order to accomplish his murder was a means of destroying or hiding evidence of the robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an automobile dealership and a finance company, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County, South Dakota, which dismissed plaintiffs' action for declaratory relief against defendant secretary of revenue requesting the circuit court to interpret statutes that imposed an excise tax on the sale of automobiles under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-5B-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ruled that plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The court reversed and held that there was no administrative decision to review, and both the department of revenue and the circuit court had jurisdiction to interpret the excise tax statutes. Plaintiffs did not seek a refund of taxes paid; rather they only sought prospective declaratory relief. Because S.D. Codified Laws ch. 21-24 and &sect; 15-6-57 authorized other means of review through declaratory relief in circuit court even when another adequate remedy existed, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 1-26-30 did not vest the department with primary jurisdiction to interpret the statutes. Because plaintiffs were not seeking a refund, declaratory relief relating to taxation matters was permitted. The court further held although the circuit court correctly ruled that State was an indispensable party, the suit against the secretary in his official capacity joined the State as a party defendant. The question at issue only required the circuit court to determine whether the secretary was acting without legal authority in imposing the tax, and such actions were not precluded by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In respondent Native American voters' federal action against petitioner state legislators, the United States District Court of the District of South Dakota certified a question, pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-24A-1, regarding whether the state legislature was authorized under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, to reapportion voting districts that were found to be apportioned in violation of &sect; 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to its mandate under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, the state legislature undertook redistricting after a federal census. The Native American voters brought a federal action, alleging the redistricting violated &sect;&sect; 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The federal court determined that the redistricting impermissibly diluted the Indian vote in violation of &sect; 2 of the Act. It gave the legislature 45 days to fashion a remedy. The legislators requested a certified question to the court as to whether the legislature had the authority to fashion a remedy, and the federal court certified the question. The court found that S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, transferred the duty of apportionment to the court only if the legislature failed to enact apportionment legislation. Where the legislature enacted valid apportionment legislation, it had no power to make another apportionment until after the next federal census. However, where the apportionment legislation was held to be invalid, it had the continuing duty to enact a valid plan. Therefore, the legislature had the authority and the duty to enact a valid apportionment plan after the federal court's decision invalidated the prior legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the question in the affirmative and held that the state constitution authorized the legislature to reapportion districts that were found to be in violation of &sect; 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was licensed to practice law in both Minnesota and Massachusetts. She applied for admission to the South Dakota Bar without examination using both bar memberships. The Board determined that the reciprocity rules for both jurisdictions were not substantially similar to South Dakota; therefore, her request was denied. The attorney then sought review. In reversing, the court determined that Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 3:01, &sect; 6.1 (2004), Minn. Admission to the Bar Rule 7 (2004), and Minn. Admission to the Bar Rule 4 (2004) were substantially similar to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 16-16-12.1, despite the differences related to the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE). The Board argued that the only rules that would be substantially similar would be those that did not required the MPRE. The language of S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 16-16-12.1, 16-16-12.2 did not required that all South Dakota attorneys be eligible for reciprocal admission in another jurisdiction in order for the admission without examination waiver to apply to that jurisdiction. Finally, the word &quot;examination&quot; in &sect; 16-16-12.1 meant the traditional bar examination, and it did not include the MPRE.</SPAN></P>

The trial court improperly placed upon the mother the burden of disproving that the grandmother's visitation was in the best interests of the child. Even if the trial court had not applied that erroneous presumption and the grandmother had been required to bear her burden of proof, she failed to establish that it was in the best interests of the child to require grandparent visitation. The grandmother's evidence did not establish any recent grandparent relationship. Although the child lived with the grandmother for four or five months when he was less than two years of age, at the time of the trial the grandmother had not seen the child in two years. There was also no showing by the grandmother that the mother was an unfit parent. Thus, the grandmother's proof established nothing other than the fact that the child had resided in the grandmother's house and that the grandmother had a relationship with the child when he was approximately two years of age.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought habeas relief from his first-degree burglary and second-degree rape convictions, contending that cumulative errors of his trial counsel amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted after he declined a plea bargain that would have avoided a mandatory life sentence. Petitioner lost his appeal and the habeas court denied relief. On appeal, petitioner claimed his counsel was ineffective because they mislead him into believing that he would not be convicted, that certain witnesses would testify, and that the habitual offender information filed against him was unconstitutional. The court found that his counsel testified that they never stated that a not guilty verdict was certain, that counsel had filed a post-conviction motion challenging the habitual offender sentencing scheme, and that their tactical decisions about which witnesses would be called reconciled with their strategy to show that the victim consented to sex and was later motivated to lie out of fear of her husband. The court noted that none of witness testimony would have produced a different outcome because much of it was inadmissible due to the rape shield laws, did not pertain to the victim's consent, or was privileged under S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant South Dakota Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a paternity action in the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, Brookings County, South Dakota, against appellee putative father seeking ton recoup public assistance paid to a child. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissing the action because it was brought after the 60-day limitations period of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-59 expired. DSS appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court had previously declared the 60-day statute of limitations to be unconstitutional. Thereafter, DSS sought a rehearing, asserting that the decision would have resulted in a loss or reduction of federal funds for child support enforcement because the portion of the statute declared unconstitutional was part of a federal mandate. DSS requested a remand so that it could proceed against the presumed father and the putative father. The appellate court held that all that could be garnered from the record was that DSS provided a child and her mother public assistance, that the presumed father was not involved in those proceedings, that the presumed father and the mother's divorce decree provided that the presumed father was not obligated to pay child support, that he had been ruled out as the child's biological father, and that the putative father had not been required to take a paternity test. The appellate court concluded that the trial would require the putative father to undergo a paternity test and that the appellate court would suspend the question whether S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-59 was unconstitutional until the facts were fully developed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County (South Dakota), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant revenue secretary in a declaratory action regarding the constitutionality of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-33A. The taxpayers also sought a refund of taxes paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers provided commercial mobile radio service in South Dakota. They filed a declaratory action seeking a judgment that S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-33A was unconstitutional. After summary judgment was granted in favor of the secretary, the taxpayers sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the action did not violate principals of sovereign immunity. Further, the court rejected the taxpayers' assertion that the licensing, bonding, and other provisions created a regulatory regime. As such, S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 was not violated as to these provisions. However, the appropriation sections of the tax, S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 10-33A-5, 10-33A-6, were unconstitutional because the title of the bill did not address the purpose of the tax. However, the rest of the provisions were constitutional because the requirements for separability were met. Next, the court held that the restrictions of 47 U.S.C.S. 253 did not apply due to the savings provision in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, &sect; 601(c)(2), 110 Stat. 56, 143-144. Finally, the court held that South Dakota had not attempted to regulate market entry, as prohibited by 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 332(c)(3)(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court's decision that held that the declaratory action violated sovereign immunity and the portion that found that the tax law did not violate the single subject rule. However, the court affirmed the determination that the tax law was not preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

The action was dismissed as to other defendants and as to other claims against the officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was in pursuit of a group of people, and upon seeing the mother's son walking in the same direction, the officer tackled the boy without warning. The boy's wrist was broken in the scuffle, and it was not until after he was handcuffed that the officer realized that the boy was not involved. The mother filed suit against several defendants, all of whom were dismissed except the officer. The officer filed a motion for summary judgment. He claimed that his physical contact with the boy was privileged, and that he was protected by qualified immunity from the alleged civil rights violations. The trial court denied summary judgment and the officer appealed. The court found that a factual issue was raised as to whether the officer's conduct was excessive, thereby removing any possible claim of privilege for the assault and battery. The court analyzed the civil rights issue under the two-part test used by federal courts for determining whether qualified immunity applied. It held that the force used was not objectively reasonable in the circumstances at a matter of law. Established law provided notice to the officer that his actions were excessive and constitutionally violative.</SPAN></P>

Defendant waived a jury trial and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County, South Dakota, found him guilty but mentally ill. Defendant appealed, claiming it was error to reject his insanity defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the court's finding of guilty but mentally ill, as some of defendant's actions could have been construed as knowledge on defendant's part, of the wrongfulness of his actions. For example, shortly after the crime defendant admitted to the officer that he had been the one who entered the apartment. Defendant also told the officer details of the break-in, including that he had broken glass and strewn it around the apartment. Defendant had taken off his shoes and cleaned up the cut on his hand. He wanted to know if the officer believed in God and if the officer wanted to hear his confessions. Although his behavior around the time of the crime revealed serious mental illness, he appeared to have some touch with reality. The circuit court also perceived problems with the medical expert's testimony on the insanity issue, pointing to the doctor's failure to do a drug screen on defendant, the weakness of his explanation of defendant's delusions, and the doctor's lack of knowledge about the victims of the crime and how that may have affected the doctor's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant were neighbors. They had obtained court orders restraining each other from harassing or stalking the other. Plaintiff later moved to continue his previous protection order or for a new order against defendant. Plaintiff asserted that defendant's harassment had taken a new form: harassment through third parties. The trial court issued an order of protection prohibiting defendant from harassing plaintiff and from filing any complaint against plaintiff with local, state, and federal government agencies, without first paying a fee to and obtaining permission from the trial court. On appeal, the court found that the order was a prior restraint on speech that abridged defendant's fundamental right to petition the government. Judicial censorship of defendant's complaints went well beyond what was necessary to accomplish a specific, constitutionally-permissible objective. The trial court abused its discretion in issuing the portion of the order limiting defendant's access to the government. The order fashioned by the trial court was an absolute prior restraint on protected speech, impermissible under the federal constitution, given the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found aggravating circumstances existed and concluded the Department of Social Services (DSS) was not required to provide reasonable efforts to reunify the mother and child. This bypass decision was authorized by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8A-21.1. The opportunity to litigate all dispositional issues was provided at the no reasonable efforts and permanency hearings.

They contended that their statements made to law enforcement subsequent to the search of their home had to be suppressed as fruit of an illegal search. The appellate court determined that there was no showing of any subjective expectation by defendants as to their claim of privacy in the trash. The trash was placed on the curb of a city street, an area readily accessible to the public. The police agent had articulable reasons for focusing on defendants' trash. The issuing judge could have determined that there was a fair probability that illegal drugs would be found at defendants' residence. The agent's affidavit described the discussion he had with a citizen informant, who identified defendants as potential drug dealers. The affidavit detailed the evidence obtained through two searches of defendants' trash, and the agent discovered a small amount of marijuana during the first trash pull.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurers questioned whether the South Dakota Department of Revenue and Regulation, Division of Insurance (department), correctly concluded that the insurers' claims for reimbursement against SIF were untimely filed. The insurers argued that equitable estoppel, equitable tolling, or both should apply to relieve them of the effects of the law and allow the presentation of the insurers' claims. For the doctrine of equitable tolling to apply, three things had to be shown: a timely notice, lack of prejudice to the defendant, and reasonable and good-faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff. The appellate court noted that the unique circumstances that were presented to the insurers after July 1, 1999, together with the reinstatement of subsequent injury fund filings by the 2001 legislation, required the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling to extend the filing period for their claims for 90 days beyond July 1, 2001.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Lincoln County (South Dakota), which denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus. After his first conviction for the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl was reversed on appeal and the cause remanded for a new trial, the inmate was again convicted and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that he was entitled to an adverse inference regarding the admission of scientific evidence destroyed before his second trial. He also contended that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The inmate would not have been entitled to an adverse inference, even if he had discovered the destruction of the evidence before his direct appeal, because the State had not acted in bad faith in the evidence's destruction and because the destruction did not impair the inmate's ability to examine comparable evidence. Accordingly, there was no error in the habeas court's conclusion that the destruction of the evidence did not amount to a violation of the inmate's constitutionally protected rights. Trial counsel's strategy to forego a vigorous defense against the admission of certain evidence in a Daubert hearing was not ineffective because the admission of such evidence was effectively challenged at trial. Finally, there was no illegitimate prosecutorial discretion involved in the decision whether to seek the death penalty. Because there was no illegitimate discretion, there could be no element of arbitrariness. The inmate's constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the habeas court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The vehicle searched was parked in the driveway, 10 feet from the house. The officer's affidavit was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable. The officer's good-faith reliance on the &quot;all vehicles&quot; provision in the warrant was objectively reasonable because the magistrate made a probable cause determination, the affidavit provided specific information about the objects of the search, the affiant helped to execute the warrant, and the courts were divided on whether a warrant authorizing the search of a home included all vehicles on the premises, including those not owned or controlled by the owner of the home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee owned and operated a bar. The suspension was the result of a violation that occurred on September 27, 2000, when a bar employee sold an alcoholic beverage to a minor. On appeal, the licensee maintained that the 2003 version of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 35-2- 10.1 should apply retroactively to his violation, and that it was impossible for him to comply with the statute at the time of the illegal sale, because no Department approved alcohol-training classes were available before October 4, 2000. The reviewing court held that the 2000 version of the statute applied, and the Department had the authority to suspend the licensee's alcoholic beverage licenses. The statute did not specifically allow for retroactive application, and the statute affected substantive rights rather than procedural rights. However, the appellate court was essentially faced with error per se, because there was simply nothing in the record upon which to make a finding that the licensee had notice concerning programs which were Department approved before they were offered prior to the October 4, 2000, class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother requested that the father be ordered to pay half the costs incurred by the child's premature birth and medical complications in the first years of his life. The trial court erred in applying S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-5 to deny her request because the statute applied only to mothers of children born out of wedlock who were pursuing child support payments, not medical expenses. The mother erroneously argued that, under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-9, she was entitled to bring proceedings to enforce the father's obligation for medical expenses any time before the child reached majority, thereby giving her an 18-year statute of limitation on the recovery of medical expenses. Although the trial court's reason for imposing a six-year statute of limitation was incorrect, the result was correct. The mother should have been permitted to recover 50 percent of the medical expenses that were not covered by insurance. The father did not establish laches or equitable estoppel. The mother argued that the trial court erred in refusing to consider a deviation in child support. The court's factual findings supporting its denial of the deviation were clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother lived in California, and the children had lived with her there for four years. The court found that, because a South Dakota court made the initial custody determination and the mother continued to reside in South Dakota, the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the grandmother's custody action under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-5A-14 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. The court found, however, that the trial court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-5A-7, as California was a more convenient forum. The children had closer connections with California, and evidence concerning their current or future well-being was more readily available in that state. They were involved in numerous activities in California, including basketball, soccer, dance, and church groups. The children had only received proper dental and medical care since their relocation to California, and one of the children had a heart valve problem. The court rejected the mother's challenge to the constitutionality of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-5-29 as moot and because the attorney general had not intervened under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-24(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor petitioned for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. At the time, she was 75 years old. Because she was over 70, she sought a homestead exemption for the entire equity of her home. The value of the claimed exemption surpassed $ 30,000. The bankruptcy trustee objected to this unlimited exemption on the ground that it violated the South Dakota Constitution. Because resolving these issues would have required a federal court to determine whether a South Dakota statute violated the South Dakota Constitution, the questions were certified to the instant court for consideration. The certified question were: (1) Whether the last sentence of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 43-45-3(2) violated S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18; and, (2) Whether the last sentence of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 43-45-3(2) violated S.D. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4. On the first question, the court ruled in the negative, but on the second question, the court held that because the last sentence of S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A media representative requested a list of individuals who were named in pardons during a seven-year period, however, all of the pardons indicated that they were sealed pursuant to S.D.

The Attorney General, in an opinion requested by the Secretary, indicated that the pardons could not be legally sealed because the South Dakota Governor had granted them outside of the Board's involvement under S.D. Codified Laws ch. 24-14. The applicants petitioned for a writ of prohibition against unsealing and allowing public inspection of the pardon records for those pardons made directly under S.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3 by the Governor. The trial court granted the writ, finding that the Governor had exclusive constitutional authority to pardon, including the power to seal pardons. On appeal, the court reviewed the history of S.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3, as well as the statutory history of accompanying legislation. The court concluded that while the South Dakota Constitution afforded the Governor the power to grant pardons, there was no authority for allowing those pardons to be sealed. Sealing under S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A paternity action was commenced by plaintiff Department of Social Services, seeking to have defendant putative father declared the child's father and requesting an order for child support. The Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, Brookings County, South Dakota, granted summary judgment dismissing the case because it had not been commenced within the 60-day statutory period allowed to contest paternity. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was pregnant at the time of the divorce from her husband. Because the husband's paternity was in doubt, the parties agreed that genetic testing would later resolve the issue. The genetic testing later established that the former husband was not the father. In the action against the putative father to establish his paternity, the circuit court dismissed the case because it had not been brought within the 60-day limitation period in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-59. On appeal, the court held that the limitation period violated the equal protection guarantees of the South Dakota and United States Constitutions. Thus, it was unconstitutional because it improperly discriminated between children with presumed fathers and children without presumed fathers. The court was left, therefore, with both the presumption of legitimacy under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-57 and the presumption of paternity from genetic testing under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-58, which created conflicting presumptions. The court reversed and remanded, stating that, whether the putative father could successfully assert the presumption of paternity had to be determined by gauging the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded to the circuit court to consider the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, Miner County, South Dakota, convicted defendants of numerous violations of South Dakota hunting law, following an undercover investigation by the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Commission (GF&amp;P) into the practices of a hunting guide service. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended the legislative criminalization of GF&amp;P regulations constituted an unlawful delegation of authority, the statutes and regulations were unconstitutionally vague, that their convictions rested on insufficient evidence, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury, and that their conditions of probation were unreasonable. The appellate court found that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 41-2-18 provided sufficient guidance for the GF&amp;P. It was the legislature that determined that violations of its regulations would be a Class 2 misdemeanor. Defendants' argument that they were presented with a cruel dilemma when faced with the decision to either leave behind a dead hen pheasant or take possession was meritless. Defendants' constitutionally protected rights were not denied where they had a method of illegally hunting that included radio communications. The regulation prohibited the pointing of a firearm at a rabbit from inside a motor vehicle, as a rabbit was not a rodent. The jury was free to determine from the evidence that the two groups of hunters were in reality acting as one. The trial court did not act unreasonably in setting the conditions for probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to unseasonably wet years, water on the landowners' property accumulated into large lakes, which the public began using for sporting and recreational opportunities. The trial court found that the land and the water were private property and it therefore enjoined public access to them. The State appealed, and the court found that all water in South Dakota belonged to the people pursuant to the public trust doctrine, judicial precedent, and statutes. It was noted that, in prior years, the land had been used for farming, some trapping of fur-bearing animals, and grazing activities, and that it was not covered by water. The court held that the lake beds were private, but that the water in the lakes was for public use. The court engaged in a thorough review of the public trust doctrine, noting that the federal navigability for title test was applicable to the lakebeds, which belonged to the landowners. Based on provisions of the Water Resources Act, S.D. Codified Laws ch. 46-1, and the public trust doctrine, the court held that water was for the benefit of the public, but that the ultimate determination as to how the water was to be beneficially used was for the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an oil and gas company owned by Indians, sought a refund of the state motor fuel tax it paid. Appellee South Dakota Department of Revenue denied the company's claims. On administrative appeal, the hearing examiner found that no claims were timely. Ultimately, the South Dakota Supreme Court reversed and remanded. Both the State and the company petitioned for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted the State's petition solely on the question of the proper limitations period for refund applications. In its prior opinion, the supreme court reasoned that because the State exceeded its authority in imposing the tax, the limitations periods imposed by the motor fuel taxation scheme were inapplicable. On further reconsideration, the supreme court held the limitations period applicable in the instant case was 15 months under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-47B-141 and that claims for times predating the Department's denial of the refund claims from which the company did not appeal were untimely. As the supreme court declared unconstitutional the State's collection of motor fuel tax from the company, consumers who timely sought and proved their entitlement to a refund could recover the taxes they paid under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-47B0-131.2. As the company's customers bore the legal and economic incidence of this tax, any person who was an enrolled member of the Indian tribe who paid the invalidly collected motor fuel tax could timely seek a refund for the taxes paid as part of their purchases made during the same period applicable to the company's timely claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the supreme court's decision holding that the limitations periods imposed by the motor fuel taxation scheme were inapplicable was vacated and replaced.

In affirming, the court determined that the possession of child pornography was not protected by the First Amendment. Section 22-22-23.1 was not overbroad because the word &quot;depiction&quot; applied to pornography involving actual children only. Section 22-22-23.1 was not required to meet the three-part test to identify obscenity because it involved child pornography. Further, &sect; 22-22-23.1 and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-22-22 (repealed) were not unconstitutionally vague because they provided adequate notice that the possession of child pornography for certain purposes was illegal. Defendant's convictions on multiple counts did not violate double jeopardy because each act of downloading and saving a pornographic picture involving children constituted a separate offense under S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court determined that legislative changes to S.D.

The legislative actions reflected legislative intent to change the permissible methods of taking appeals from boards of adjustment. The statutory method of appealing the decision of the board of adjustment in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 11-2-61 preempted the county commission review under Yankton County, S.D., Temporary Zoning Ordinance (TZO) &sect; 1903. Because the appeal taken to the county commission under the TZO was preempted, there was no permit decision before the county commission that could be appealed to the circuit court under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 7-8-28. Because the taxpayers did not take an appeal from the board of adjustment to the circuit court as directed by S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit, Codington County (South Dakota), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss three counts of stalking on the ground that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-19A-1(3) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of stalking after he violated a protective order by telephoning a victim. He filed a motion to dismiss the charges, alleging that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-19A-1(3) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. After the trial court granted his motion to dismiss, the State sought review. In reversing, the court determined that &sect; 22-19A-1(3) was not overbroad. The court noted that defendant had standing to challenge &sect; 22-19A-1 because the language of the statute could have caused others to refrain from constitutionally protected speech, despite the fact that defendant's speech might not have been constitutionally protected. Section 22-19A-1(3)'s application to protected speech was not &quot;real&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; in an absolute sense nor in relation to the scope of the law's plainly legitimate application. Further, &sect; 22-19A-1(3) was not void for vagueness. Section 22-19A-1 was defined with definiteness and certainty, despite the fact that it failed to include an objective standard. The criminal application was plain because the protective order clearly prohibited defendant from having any contact with the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the state trooper did not have a reasonable suspicion sufficient to stop his vehicle. The appellate court found that the trooper had a specific and articulable suspicion of a violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-15-6, to justify the initial stop of defendant's vehicle. The trooper articulated specific non-pretextual facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the traffic stop. There was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that the drug dog alerted to the odor of an illegal substance. The trial court reviewed the tape, watched the trooper testify, and listened to defense counsel's cross-examination and suppression arguments. The trial court judged four witnesses' credibility after listening to their live testimony. Based on the trial court's finding of a drug alert, the trooper had probable cause to search the vehicle. Double jeopardy did not bar successive prosecutions by dual sovereigns. South Dakota had no control over the prosecution of the federal case. Comity did not apply because the State was not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal court in the prior proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court failed to advise petitioner of the mandatory minimums for the crimes to which he pled guilty. Petitioner contended that failure rendered his pleas unconstitutional. In State v.

However, the appellate court held that, in a S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 2255 action, when a collateral attack was made for failure of the district court to literally comply with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-7-4 (Rule 11), petitioner had to show prejudice in order to qualify for relief. Secondly, it was reasonable for petitioner's counsel to concentrate her efforts on securing a plea agreement based on the circumstances, and her alleged failure to fully investigate the child victims' statements did not constitute ineffective assistance. Finally, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27-7 required disclosure of the presentence investigation report (PSI) to petitioner and counsel, but only counsel reviewed the report. However, re-sentencing was not required, where there was no showing of prejudice, and where the record showed counsel discussed the PSI with petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's driving privileges were revoked for an &quot;indefinite period of time.&quot; Defendant appealed, asserting his license revocation was unlawful and his penitentiary sentence was unconstitutional, on grounds of &quot;racial disparity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a lengthy criminal record, including 5 DUIs (with a sixth at the age of 17) and a conviction for involuntary manslaughter in federal court. In the instant action, under a plea agreement, several related misdemeanor charges were dismissed. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-4.6 provided the license revocation penalty for a DUI (fourth offense) or subsequent offenses. The words in &sect; 32-23-4.6, &quot;for such period of time as may be determined by the court,&quot; connoted a definite period, not an indeterminate one. Thus, the appellate court remanded the matter for the trial court to order revocation of defendant's driving privileges for a definite period. As to his 5-year sentence for DUI (fourth offense), and its proportionality, the appellate court rejected defendant's selective prosecution claim and his assertion of an equal protection violation based on race. There was no inference of gross disproportionality and no evidence of discriminatory intent. Most importantly, defendant submitted only statistics, and, in the absence of any evidence, much less proof, of discrimination in the record, that was insufficient to show an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, defendant's sentence on the license revocation was reversed, and that matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The jury awarded the employee $ 25,000 in compensatory damages and $ 500,000 in punitive damages. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer terminated the employee. Subsequently, the employee brought suit against the employer for age discrimination and invasion of privacy. The invasion of privacy claim was based on a current employee's opening of a letter that came to the employer's address after the employee's termination which was addressed to the employee. The current employee made copies of the contents and placed it in a new envelope to disguise that it had been opened. The appellate court found that the employer fraudulently concealed its act and that the employee acted with diligence in discovering his invasion of privacy claim and filed suit within the statute of limitations. Because the employee's mail was opened by the employer, photocopied, and disseminated to the current employee's superiors, there was competent and substantial evidence upon which a jury could find the employer liable for invading the employee's privacy. Additionally, the appellate court could not say that the compensatory damages award was excessive. However, the appellate court found that the punitive damages award was unreasonable and disproportionate to the harm caused and the wrong committed, and a new trial was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment regarding the jury's punitive damage award and remanded the case for a new trial on punitive damages.

The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the circuit erred in finding that the use tax was collectible. The company argued that no use tax was payable because it contracted for the printing of its bills by a third party, and as a result, the company did not generate, print, or mail the bills to in-state residents. The appellate court found that, under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-45-4.1, the Department was not seeking to tax the purchase and use of tangible personal property. The company used an out-of-state billing service to collect its fees from its South Dakota subscribers, and only those services attributable to South Dakota customers were subject to the tax. The use tax was fairly related to state-provided services because the company had the right and benefit of selling its services to South Dakota residents and did not discriminate against interstate commerce because the tax compensated the state for sales tax imposed on similar in-state transactions. The tax was fairly apportioned because the services taxed were only attributable to the billing of South Dakota subscribers and the law provided a credit against use tax for transactions in which a sales tax was paid in other states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit Clay County, South Dakota, defendant was convicted on two counts of possession of child pornography and for the possession of marijuana. On appeal, defendant raised the issues of whether exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry without a search warrant into his home to obtain weapons and whether videos and magazines found in the search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's neighbor was granted a protective order against him, which required defendant to surrender all of his firearms to the county sheriff. When the sheriff went to defendant's residence to obtain the guns, he and the officers saw marijuana, marijuana paraphernalia, and several weapons. The officers took the guns and applied for a search warrant for various drugs and paraphernalia. While the law enforcement officers were executing the warrant at defendant's residence, they came across a trunk that contained various videotapes and photographs that depicted nude female children. The officers obtained a search warrant to view the tapes. The state supreme court found that the officers' entry into defendant's home to retrieve the weapons, when the protection order provided for such action and when the officers reasonably believed that the weapons posed a serious threat to the safety of the public, did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Because the officers were lawfully inside defendant's residence to obtain the firearms, the marijuana and other incriminating evidence were within their &quot;plain view.&quot; Thus, the &quot;plain view&quot; exception to the warrant requirement applied.</SPAN></P>

After an adjudicatory hearing, the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court, Bennett County, South Dakota, adjudged the child abused and neglected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents testified that when the child was told to perform a household task, the child was contentious. A few days later, the child's sister noticed a large bruise on the child, and the bruise was reported to the authorities. On review, several issues were raised, including whether there was sufficient evidence, whether the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings were properly joined, and whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing expert testimony. The parents contended that spanking the child with a belt constituted reasonable force. The record, however, did not support the parents' assertion that the child was out of control. The appellate court also found that the disposition and adjudicatory hearings were properly bifurcated. Further, evidence about the child's life was permissible. Proper foundation was laid for the state's expert testimony, which the trial court was free to accept or reject. The parents' argument was unsupported that photos of the child should have been excluded. Finally, the child abuse statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state to amend its petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State initiated a quo warranto proceeding to determine whether defendant incumbent or the challenger was legally entitled to the office of road district trustee. The Fourth Judicial Circuit Court, Lawrence County, South Dakota, ruled that the incumbent legally held the office, holding that the incumbent's nominating petition was valid and that the challenger's petition was invalid. The State appealed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incumbent circulated his petition prior to January 1, in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12-6-4.1. The challenger filed her petition with the district secretary, instead of the district clerk. By the time the clerk received the petition, the deadline for filing under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 31-12A-17 had expired. The trial court concluded that the incumbent's petition was valid because S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12-6-4.1 did not apply to road district elections. However, the instant court observed that the plain language of former S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 31-12A-15 (amended 2002) required that road district elections be conducted under the municipal election procedures in S.D. Codified Laws ch. 9-13. Those statutes unambiguously directed application of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 12-6, which included S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12-6-4.1. Rules of statutory construction required application of the early circulation prohibition. The incumbent was not entitled to the office of district trustee. The clerk correctly determined that the challenger's petition was not timely. The State did not show that the challenger substantially complied with the requirements of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 31-12A-17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court reversed the ruling on the incumbent's petition, affirmed the ruling on the challenger's petition, and remanded for any remaining issues.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the homeowners argued that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim that fraudulent concealment on the part of engineers tolled the 10-year statutes of limitation contained in S.D.

VI, &sect; 20 were violated when the trial court, under the terms of &sect; 15-2A-3, dismissed the developer's cross-claim against FMG for indemnity or contribution. The appellate court rejected the arguments. The court agreed that the homeowners' fraudulent concealment claim did not toll the 10-year statutes of limitation. There was no confidential relationship between engineers and the homeowners; the statements by the engineers were expression of opinions, rather than affirmations of fact; and the engineers disclosed their reports and opinions with the members of the zoning committee. Further, the court found that &sect; 15-2A-3 did not abolish the right-to-sue design professionals. It simply limited that right to 10 years after substantial completion of construction. Therefore, &sect; 15-2A-3 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the fraternal order summary judgment, finding that the fraternal order acted in reliance on the prior circuit court order. The lottery company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fraternal order attempted to terminate the lease with the lottery company wherein video lottery machines were operated on the fraternal order's premises. The lottery company appealed the trial court's decision in favor of the fraternal order, and the fraternal order did not wait for the South Dakota Supreme Court's decision on appeal before it elected to remove the video lottery machines. The issue on appeal was whether a party who acted upon a court order, which was subsequently reversed on appeal, had to compensate the other party for losses sustained. The appellate court stated that, because a reversal left a case standing as if no judgment had been entered, the prevailing party at trial incurred liability for restitution to the opposing party, if the former party executed on a judgment that was reversed on appeal. To avoid liability in such a situation, the party prevailing at trial had to wait until after the time to appeal lapsed before acting on the judgment. Because the fraternal order was liable for its reliance on the declaratory judgment while the appeal was pending, it had to restore the benefits the lottery company lost when its machines were improperly removed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the matter was remanded to reinstate the lottery company's action for damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant South Dakota Department of Revenue denied a tax refund request made by plaintiff licensed fuel importer. On appeal to the circuit court, the case was remanded to the Department. The Department accepted the proposed decision of a hearing examiner, and the importer appealed to the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County, South Dakota. The trial court affirmed the Department's ruling, and the importer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The importer was a corporation operated on an Indian reservation and owned by a registered tribe member. The importer purchased fuel out-of-state and transported it for sale at its station on the reservation. Most of the customers were tribe members. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the Hayden-Cartwright Act of 1935, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 104, did not permit the taxation of motor fuel sales to tribal members by a native American corporation operating on an Indian reservation, as the Act's language did not evince a manifest unmistakable intent to abrogate tax immunity. The court further held that the importer was a tribal member for purposes of determining whether it was entitled to a refund of the illegally collected tax. However, the court held that the importer was so entitled only to the extent that it was a consumer, i.e. used the fuel for its own purposes on the reservation. The court found no due process violation, as the S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-47B-42 allowed for a refund of the illegally collected tax. Lastly, the court held that no statute of limitations applied, as the state was outside of its jurisdiction in imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to direct the Department to determine the correct amount of the invalid tax, determine, upon proper application, the correct amount of the invalid tax that applied to purchases by reservation Indian consumers, and determine related questions, such as prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

There was no tire weight exception available, and defendants were properly cited for gross weight violations. The civil penalties imposed under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-55 were not excessive. The vehicle overweight statutes did not violate defendants' rights to equal protection of the laws. The statutes did not set up arbitrary classifications among persons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant truck driver was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Fourth Judicial Circuit, Meade County (South Dakota), of violating South Dakota's overweight motor vehicle statutes and was assessed double civil penalties. He appealed on several issues, challenging the constitutionality and applicability of the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 32-22. He also appealed his conviction for violating S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-57.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck had a total gross weight of 166,400 pounds. Because it was traveling on the Interstate, &sect; 32-22-16 restricted its weight to 80,000 pounds. In calculating the total weight of a vehicle, all the axles were included. The Supreme Court of South Dakota concluded that a &quot;group&quot; of axles could encompass all the axles on a vehicle to calculate a gross weight violation or a &quot;group&quot; could encompass any &quot;two or more consecutive axles,&quot; which constituted a weight violation. Chapter 32-22 applied equally to all vehicle operators in similar circumstances. Any other persons who would have been driving the truck, regardless of their occupations, would have been subject to the same fines and penalties. The overweight statutes did not set up arbitrary classifications among persons similarly situated. The supreme court also concluded that ch. 32-22, as it related to permit and non-permit vehicles, was not unconstitutionally arbitrary and capricious and it did not violate the equal protection guarantees.

Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-4.1 provided for sentence enhancement, if prior DUI convictions occurred within the previous 5 years. Prior to his third DUI conviction, the statute was amended to extend the timeframe for enhancement purposes to the previous 10 years. On appeal, defendant argued his prior convictions were void for sentencing enhancement purposes, as their use violated his rights to due process and to know the nature and cause of the accusations against him. He further contended the application of the prior convictions to enhance his penalty violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. The appellate court initially noted it was not necessary for a trial court to inform a defendant of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea and that a defendant was not entitled, as a constitutional right, to information regarding the future use of his conviction for purposes of enhancement. The appellate court held S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-4.1 operated prospectively, as the punishment was for the then existing conviction and not the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The mother served notice on the social workers more than three years after the daughter's death and filed her complaint more than four years after the death. The South Dakota Supreme Court found that: (1) the mother failed to comply with the notice requirements of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 3-21-2 and the statute of limitations which barred her claims against the social workers because the date of death was the triggering event and there was no fraudulent concealment; (2) the social workers were entitled to good faith immunity under S.D.

The police asked defendant's friend to wear a wire. Defendant did not have a justifiable expectation of privacy in his conversation with the friend; thus, his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. Also, he failed to establish a violation of either his Fifth or Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Furthermore, he failed to establish that the trial judge had a personal bias or that his impartiality was questionable. Additionally, he failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial because evidence of &quot;other acts&quot; was either admissible or he did not show prejudice. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant and co-defendants planned the murder so that they could steal the victim's property and that they tortured him; thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses of manslaughter and second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 32-2-7, the stop was limited and applied only to motor carriers upon the state highways. If stops could not be made at any time, truck drivers would be free to violate the law and regulations with impunity. South Dakota statutes provided adequate limits on what was to be inspected, as well as when and where the inspections were to take place.

The Circuit Court of the Third Judicial District Circuit, Codington County, South Dakota, determined that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-4-52 (2002) was unconstitutional and terminated the grandparents' visitation rights. The grandparents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparent's son and the mother of their two grandchildren were divorced and the mother was given custody of both children.

When the mother decided to relocate, the grandparents petitioned to modify their visitation schedule, and the mother sought a declaration that &sect; 25-4-52 was unconstitutional and termination the grandparents' visitation rights. On appeal the grandparents argued that &sect; 25-4-52 was not unconstitutional, and alternatively that the issue was not determinative as their visitation rights arose by agreement and were approved by the court in the decree. The appellate court found that the mother failed to overcome the strong presumption in favor of constitutionality, noting inter alia that the statute did not unreasonably deprive her of the fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of the children. The court further found that the grandparents' visitation rights would not be affected by the unconstitutionality of the statute, as they arose by contract and were neither expressly prohibited nor contrary to an express provision of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff disposal company appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County, South Dakota, granting a new trial after the jury awarded the company damages against the State of South Dakota, in an inverse condemnation action resulting from the voters' disapproval in a referendum of a legislatively authorized waste disposal facility to be developed at the company's landfill site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant case was remanded to the circuit court for determination of the damages, if any, the company suffered as a result of the voter's action. The circuit court allowed the jury to choose between three different methods for measuring damages for the period of the taking. However, the circuit court concluded after trial that its instructions improperly allowed the jury to award consequential damages and ordered a new trial. On appeal, the company argued for the Nemmers model of measuring damages. The court characterized the taking as temporary, noting that, at most, the company had a right to no more than a five-year permit and that, while the company was forced to wait 43 months until a federal court determined the voter's action constituted a taking, the taking was only of a right to fill empty volume, a resource that still remained on the site. Under these facts, the court found the Nemmers model was too speculative to provide an appropriate damages measure. The court determined that, on remand, the company's damages should be measured by the difference between the interest on the present value of its cash flows, as they would have been with and without the 43 month delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order for a new trial and remanded with specific direction for computing damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pursued, in a vehicle driven by his brother, his former middle school principal, at a public business and repeatedly mouthed a profanity, with the accompanying middle finger gesture, in the presence of the principal's family. Defendant argued that: (1) his use of profanity, coupled with his offensive gestures and subsequent actions, was constitutionally protected speech; (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for disorderly conduct under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-13-1; and (3) the trial court's adjudication of defendant as a delinquent child amounted to an unconstitutional application of &sect; 22-13-1. The instant court observed that this was not merely the use of one profane word or one obscene gesture, but was an ongoing aggression that fell outside free speech protection. Defendant's act of retaliation against the principal for not letting him skip the eighth grade and advance to high school was not political speech. It was an unprovoked form of harassment, done but for no apparent purpose than to incite a violent reaction in the principal. The use of this language in light of the circumstances was sufficient to uphold defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff juvenile sued defendants, a juvenile services center, the center's administrator, a nursing services company, and individual nurses. The juvenile alleged, among other things, that the nurses negligently failed to follow the center's medical protocol. The Seventh Judicial Circuit Court, Pennington County, South Dakota, granted defendants' motion for summary judgment based on statutory immunity. The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, who was detained at the center for alleged theft and arrived at the center in good health, underwent two surgeries arising from his appendix having ruptured. The second surgery was necessary to clean out extensive infections that had developed from the appendix having ruptured before the juvenile was taken to see a doctor. The juvenile alleged that the nurses failed to follow the center's established medical protocol, which resulted in the two separate surgeries. The trial court granted summary judgment based on the statutory immunity provided in S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 3-21-8, 3-21-9(5). The juvenile argued that: (1) the statutes in question unconstitutionally denied him a remedy in violation of South Dakota's &quot;open courts&quot; provision in S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20; and (2) the statutes in question denied him equal protection of the law. The instant court held that the &quot;open courts&quot; provision did not abolish sovereign immunity. The juvenile could not use the &quot;open courts&quot; provision to override an otherwise valid act of the legislature. The statutory immunity provided by the statutes in question was essential to protect the public decision-making process.</SPAN></P>

There was evidence that defendant drove her cohorts and the victim to a secluded area in defendant's car; that defendant did nothing to get help from a nearby farm house or try to leave the scene. There was evidence that defendant may have actively participated in the killing by throwing a tire jack at the victim's body and by kicking the victim. After the victim's body was dragged into a ditch, defendant helped clean up the crime scene and offered her companions a bag in which to put the bloody clothes. The supreme court also found that S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board found that the physician knowingly testified falsely as an expert witness in another physician's (defendant) malpractice case. The board concluded that this constituted conduct unbecoming a person licensed to practice medicine in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 36-4-29 (2). The circuit court determined that the board should be bound by a criminal standard for perjury pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-29-1 when determining whether the physician, in fact, testified falsely. Furthermore, it found that the physician's statement that the review was a peer review rather than an investigation was an opinion, and not the product of false testimony. The appellate court held that the defendant in the malpractice case was allowed to use all of the information regarding the second opinion requirement to impeach the physician's credibility, which was appreciated by a jury who found in favor of defendant. Merely failing to agree 100 percent with defendant's interpretation did not equate false testimony. Based on the gravity of the result and the lack of evidence clearly demonstrating the physician testified falsely, the appellate court agreed with the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were married, owned an adult bookstore, and they wanted to sell drug paraphernalia to increase profits. Defendants spoke to several law enforcement agencies and were informed that they could not do so legally. The female defendant sold &quot;pipes&quot; to undercover officers, giving both of them free packages of screens, which were commonly used for smoking marijuana, when they purchased the &quot;pipes.&quot; The male defendant was involved in stocking the &quot;pipes&quot; for sale, and his statements to law enforcement were indicative of his knowledge that the &quot;pipes&quot; he wished to sell were legally questionable. The South Dakota Supreme Court found that: (1) S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-42A-4 was not unconstitutionally vague, and it did not encourage arbitrary enforcement, as it had objective standards for determining what constituted drug paraphernalia; and (2) the evidence was sufficient for a jury to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the &quot;pipes&quot; sold were drug paraphernalia and that both defendants knew or reasonably should have known of the pipes' drug related nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the circuit court abused its discretion when denying its motion to amend its complaint for declaratory judgment. The appellate court found that the company filed its motion to amend not only after the circuit court had entered its judgment, but also after it filed its appeal with the appellate court. After the appeal was filed, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear the company's motion. The company filed its claims prematurely the claims were not adjudicated or settlement approved until after as S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 62-4-34.1 was repealed. Repeal of &sect; 62-4-34.1 and promulgation of S.D.

The statute of limitations of &sect; 62-4-34.1 applied to the company's claims. The judgment was a final order addressing all of the issues raised before the circuit court and left no issues undetermined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff landfill filed suit against the defendant county in the Brule County Circuit Court (South Dakota) alleging that the county violated its due process rights by refusing to issue a landfill permit. Initially, the court found in favor of the landfill, but on remand, the court granted the county's motion for summary judgment. The landfill appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landfill's permit was postponed pending re-approval by the county. The county ultimately denied approval for the landfill. The landfill argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred because the landfill had a protected property interest in the first approved permit. The supreme court disagreed. In the landfill's prior appeal, the supreme court stated that, in order to demonstrate that it held a protected property interest, the landfill had to show that the county did not have the discretion to deny its permission, despite the landfill's failure to meet the six-month deadline requirement. The plain language of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34A-6-103 clearly indicated that any prior approval lapsed after the passage of six months. Accordingly, the landfill was expected to again seek the county's approval before receiving the permit. It followed that because the county had the discretion to approve or disapprove the project under &sect; 34A-6-103, even after prior approval had been given, the landfill had no clear entitlement to, or protected property interest in the permit. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting the county's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Those were declined, one due to conflicts with her other employment, and the other because it would have required moving to a different town. There was no showing that the employee refused to search for work or unreasonably declined employment offers. The employee was persistent in her efforts to find employment and her testimony was honest, forthright, and credible. The question of whether the employee made a reasonable job search was a question of fact. The employee's job search was sufficient and the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the record supported that decision. Therefore, the circuit court correctly determined that the employee made a prima facie case under the odd-lot doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an argument, defendant used a rifle against an unarmed man who may or may not have retreated from an altercation with defendant. Defendant fired 10 shots, 6 of which hit the victim. The defense attorneys hired an expert to evaluate defendant's mental state in preparation for trial, but did not use him as a witness or enter his report into evidence. On cross-examination, the State made use of the defense expert's report to impeach defendant's testimony, and defense counsel never objected. The State's expert testified that the physical evidence did not dispute the defense theory. On direct appeal, defense counsel failed to raise the issue that the cruel and unusual element of the crime was not sufficiently proved. The South Dakota Supreme Court found that defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, because he failed to show that counsel was ineffective or that any prejudice resulted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grandmother brought guardianship proceedings to gain custody of her daughter's minor children on grounds of abuse and neglect. The Circuit Court Of The Sixth Judicial Circuit, Tripp County (South Dakota), determined the children to be abused and neglected, determined appellant mother to be unfit, terminated the mother's custodial rights, and granted custody to the grandmother. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether a guardianship proceeding commenced by a non-parent and based upon allegations of abuse and neglect was a proper proceeding to terminate the custodial rights of a natural parent. The supreme court held that proceedings instituted under the South Dakota Guardianship Act, S.D. Codified Laws ch. 29A-5, were not the proper means of transferring custody from a parent to a non-parent without a prior determination of a parent's unfitness. Adjudication of abuse or neglect was required to be done in juvenile court, pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws ch. 26-7A and 26-8A, which provided numerous constitutional safeguards.  S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-7A-2 provided exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile court, as to dependant or neglected children. These chapters were enacted for the particular purpose of establishing an effective state and local system for the protection of children from abuse or neglect. Moreover, the department of social services could not be bypassed, and the State was the only party that could seek to involuntarily deprive a parent of custody and place the custody of the child with a non-parent when abuse and neglect was the contested issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed, as to the creation of a guardianship, but reversed and remanded, as to the determination of abuse and neglect and transfer of custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third Judicial Circuit Court, Brookings County, South Dakota, granted summary judgment to plaintiff taxpayer in his challenge to the legality of change orders executed by defendant city on a construction project, ruling that the change orders were void and ordering intervenor contractor to refund all amounts paid on the invalid change orders, resulting in a forfeiture of $ 548,001. The city and the contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state auditor concluded that the change orders were unlawful, the taxpayer sought to enjoin the city from paying the contractors until a judicial determination regarding the legality of the change orders could be obtained. In response, the city adopted an ordinance allowing the city to proceed even if the change orders were later judicially declared unlawful and void under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 5-18-19. Although the trial court denied the taxpayer's motion for an injunction, it ruled as a matter of law that two of the change orders violated &sect; 5-18-19 and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The instant court agreed that the ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid. However, whether the change orders were void depended on whether they were necessitated by circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time the underlying contract was let and were necessary to the completion of the project under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 5-18-18.3. If the change orders were found to violate &sect; 5-18-18.3, the instant court held that in the absence of fraud, collusion, or undue influence, the contractor could still retain those funds previously received on the two change orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for trial. The instant court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the city's ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid. However, whether the change orders violated state law was a question of fact, and the instant court reversed summary judgment for the taxpayer on that issue.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 42-7-71 and the Special Racing Revolving Fund, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 42-7-79.1, to the general appropriations bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed an amendment that mandated that the treasurer transfer money from the South Dakota Bred Racing Fund and the Special Racing Revolving Fund to a variety of other funds. The state legislators argued the appropriations were invalid. The state supreme court held that, as appropriations bills were administrative in nature, the legislature had the authority to transfer appropriations from special funds. While the court acknowledged an inconsistency, in that it took a two-thirds majority to establish the special funds and only a simple majority to transfer the money from the special funds to a variety of other funds, that practice had been approved by the court for over 55 years. The general appropriations bill that authorized the transfer of the funds did not require a two-thirds majority, as none of the transfers constituted an extraordinary expense. Finally, the court held that the amendment did not violate the single subject requirement, as the challenged appropriations did not substantively change or amend existing law on the use of funds in the Bred Racing Fund or the Special Racing Revolving Fund.</SPAN></P>

The attorneys appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband died after being allegedly misdiagnosed. The medical malpractice suit was first filed in federal court by the widow's first attorney within the statute of limitations period. An action was later filed in state court by the appellant attorneys. Subsequently, the federal court dismissed after determining that there was no diversity jurisdiction. The state court then dismissed due to the running of the statute of limitations. The attorneys argued that the trial court erred by holding that the three-year wrongful death statute of limitations, rather than the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations governed in the medical malpractice claim, and therefore, they were not proper parties to the instant suit. The supreme court agreed. After examining the language of the statutes, the legislative intent and policy, the rules of statutory construction and the precedent from South Dakota regarding statutes of limitations, the supreme court reversed the determination that the relevant statute of limitations was three years and that the attorneys were proper parties to the suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue at trial was the dog's dangerousness. The trial court concluded that an independent factual determination of the dog's disposition was not appropriate, and therefore merely reviewed the animal control officer's determination for its legality. The supreme court held the ordinances at issue advanced a legitimate public safety objective and were neither unreasonable or arbitrary on their face. But, the trial court's ruling under Pierre, S.D., City Ordinance &sect;&sect;10-3-111 and 10-3-117 operated to deprive defendant of a protected property interest in his dog and absent exigent circumstances, the City was required to provide him with notice, an opportunity to be heard and a proper criminal adjudication by a judicial officer. The requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard were not disputed. The requirement of a hearing by a disinterested judicial officer, however, was not satisfied. Because the City brought criminal as opposed to civil charges the defendant was entitled to a due process hearing on the issue of dangerousness and the City was required to prove, as an element of the crime, that the dog was dangerous beyond a reasonable doubt, which it had not done.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's family owned three dogs: one shepherd-collie mix and two golden retrievers. In 1999, the shepherd-collie weighed 75 pounds; the male golden retriever, 30 pounds; and the female golden retriever, 20 pounds. In February 2000, defendant was notified that by housing 3 dogs weighing over 25 pounds she was in violation of Marion, S.D., Ordinance 232, &sect; 2, which became effective in January 2000. The city ordered defendant to remove one dog. Defendant ignored the demand and was issued a citation. The trial court ruled that the weight restriction violated defendant's substantive due process rights under S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, and exceeded the city's authority conferred by the legislature. The instant court held that the weight limit in the ordinance, read together with the freedom to possess four dogs, two of which could be any size, was sufficiently related to the purpose of protecting public health and safety. Thus, the ordinance did not unreasonably exceed the city's regulatory authority. Furthermore, because there was a rational relationship between the ordinance and the problems caused by large dogs, the ordinance did not violate the South Dakota Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised three issues: (1) Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by granting the State's motion in limine to forbid the defense to question or comment on the decedent's apparent blood alcohol level at the time of the accident; (2) whether the circuit court erred by upholding the second search of defendant's dwelling; and (3) whether a second blood draw performed by the police was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The South Dakota Supreme Court held: (1) the circuit court abused its discretion by denying defense the opportunity to offer evidence of the decedent's blood alcohol level, thus, defendant deserved a new trial on this issue; (2) the search and seizure did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights; and (3) the second blood draw was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The conviction was reversed and remanded for a new trial as to the issue that the lower court abused its discretion by not allowing defendant to produce evidence about the decedent's blood alcohol level at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed, holding that (1) the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the action based on the supreme court's prior decisions in the case and because appellee was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies; (2) the supreme court's prior decisions did not bar the instant action, because the action previously before the court did not seek to redress the same wrong; (3) S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-28-16 was not unconstitutional, as the legislature had created a centrally assessed classification for railroad operating property for taxation purposes; (4) the valuation process had been fully litigated; (5) second appellant had a sufficient interest in the action to be allowed to intervene; and (6) appellee's motion to file a supplemental complaint was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Appellant submitted the claim to appellee, a risk-pooling entity of which appellant was a member. Appellee denied coverage because the policy excluded coverage for any wrongful act of any member in connection with any tax assessment, fine, fee, or adjustment, or the collection, refund, disbursement, or application of any taxes. Appellant brought a declaratory action against appellee, seeking a determination of insurance coverage under an errors and omissions policy. The circuit court granted summary judgment to appellee, finding that coverage was excluded. The supreme court affirmed. Because the property owners' lawsuit challenged the assessment, the claim fell within the tax exclusion. It was an act in connection with any tax assessment or adjustment, or the collection, refund, disbursement, or application of any taxes.

The Governor, Cement Plant Commission, and management began exploring the possibility of selling the plant. A sales agreement was concluded, and the agreement was made contingent on approval and ratification by the South Dakota Legislature. The Governor called the Legislature into a special session. During the course of that session, the Legislature passed a series of five bills and resolutions necessary to ratify the purchase agreement. Prior to the special session, plaintiff brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, the Governor and Legislators of the special session. She sought to prevent the sale. The trial court denied relief. Plaintiff appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The sale of the cement plant was not prohibited by the state Constitution. The Legislature was empowered to authorize the sale of the plant. Nor did the sale violate state law. Also, the manner in which the sale was conducted did not violate public policy. Further, the Legislature did not improperly attach emergency clauses to the three bills approving the plant's sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged the failure of appellant to refund payment to the county after collecting additional monies for funeral services from other sources constituted theft by deception. The Pennington County Burial Assistance Guidelines purported to prohibit appellant from collecting additional monies without reimbursing the county. However, these guidelines were never validly enacted. By failing to follow the proper procedure for enacting the indigent assistance guidelines, the county's actions were a legal nullity. The guidelines did not prohibit appellant from collecting the reasonable value of his services from the decedent's family or estate. The stipulated facts failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant created or reinforced a false impression as to the law to obtain property in an amount over $ 500, with intent to defraud.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiff argued that trial court erred in holding that the State and defendant officers were immune from suit for failure to supervise the guard.

In 1991 the legislature apportioned its membership by enacting &sect; 2-2-28, and there was no constitutional authority for another legislative apportionment until 2001. Once a valid apportionment law was enacted, no future act could be passed by the legislature until after the next regular apportionment period prescribed by the state constitution. The court disagreed with defendants' argument that the amendment was not an apportionment, but merely changed one voting district from two single-member districts into a dual-member district. The amendment effected an apportionment, as it abolished distribution of a legislative seat in Districts No. 28A and 28B, and distributed two seats to District No. 28. The legislature acted beyond its constitutional limits, and the amendment was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court was correct that the appellee was not limited by the factors found in Aurora County, S.D., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 515. Aurora County, S.D., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 515 established specific standards that one must meet either before the issuance of a permit or after, but it did not preclude other considerations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, chief executive officer of mental health center, petitioned for an order to force medicate appellant, an involuntarily committed mental health patient, based on appellant's incompetence. Appellant moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the forced medication statutes violated the due process clause of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because the statutes did not require the treatment to be the least restrictive alternative. The trial court denied the motion, and issued an order to force medicate. The court affirmed the forced medication order. While the statutes did not explicitly recite the least restrictive treatment alternative standard, the statutes required that appellant be advised of any appropriate and available alternative treatments. Additionally, in deciding whether or not to order forced medication, the trial court had to find by clear and convincing evidence that the treatment was medically beneficial, necessary, and essential. By requiring these considerations before psychotropic medication could be administered, the forced medication statutes comported with the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of the media sought a writ of prohibition alleging that a South Dakota circuit court judge exceeded his authority in entering a pretrial participant gag order claiming the order violated its U.S. Const. amend I right of freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court deemed deem it appropriate to review the trial court's gag order in this prohibition action, and concluded the media had standing to challenge the validity of the order. The restriction precluding interviewing and broadcasting from the courtroom but not restricting any other location or the subject matter that was broadcast was content neutral, protected a significant government interest in providing both parties with their U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a fair trial, and left open all other alternative locations for communication. The order comported with the trial court's duty to maintain order, dignity and decorum in the courtroom. The trial court was justified in concluding there was, and would likely continue to be, intense and pervasive pretrial publicity surrounding this case, and a reasonable likelihood existed that such publicity might impair the defendants' right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 22-11-16(2) was interpreted as being confined to conduct designed to influence specifically jurors and persons summoned or drawn as jurors, and did not include people intending to inform the public or express public opinions. Thus, the relevant question was whether defendant knowingly targeted prospective jurors in particular, with the specific intent to influence their verdict. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's teaching contract was not renewed after lengthy remedial efforts by appellee school district to improve her skills.

Appellant first scheduled the hearing, then went to court and obtained a preliminary injunction to stop the hearing. After the injunction was dissolved, the hearing proceeded. On appeal the court affirmed that the Board had jurisdiction to decide whether or not to renew a teacher's contract, despite the court action, of S.D. Codified Laws chs. 13-43, and the hearing process did not violate appellant's procedural due process rights, although she should have been allowed to attend the evidence taking hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, denied parole by the South Dakota Board of Pardons and Paroles (Board), appealed under the S.D.

Parole was purely discretionary; no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence existed, thus, parole hearings were not contested proceedings subject to appeal. Under state statutes, single board member parole hearings were permissible because the entire Board acted on each appellant's case and approved the single member's action. Recording parole hearings and written reasons for parole denial were not required. Requiring appellants sentenced before a newly enacted parole statute became effective to serve out their sentences under the system in place when they committed their crimes did not violate appellants' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 22-22-30, violated the ex post facto clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 12. Looking to the statutes themselves, the court found that they were intended to aid law enforcement in preventing future crimes, not to punish offenders anew. The court then found that the statutes were not punitive in effect. The court noted that registration was not historically viewed as punishment, that it was not excessive in light of the goal of protecting women and children from crime, that it did not promote deterrence, and that scienter was irrelevant. Noting that registration was not punishment, the court found that it was not cruel and unusual. The court also rejected appellant's ineffective assistance claim, noting that trial strategy was within counsel's discretion.</SPAN></P>
