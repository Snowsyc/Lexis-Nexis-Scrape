</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that former &sect; 123-1 prohibited any unreasonably loud or disturbing sound of such character, intensity, volume, carrying power or duration as to disturb the comfort, repose, health or safety of any individual. When used in this context, such adjectives were inherently vague because they required persons of average intelligence to guess at the meaning of the words. Noise that one person might consider loud and disturbing might not disturb the sensibilities of another listener. Thus, these phrases did not provide a degree of definiteness sufficient to save the ordinance from the vagueness challenge. The per se violations were defined as constituting, &quot;unreasonably loud or disturbing sound&quot; and could not be evaluated separately from the vague terms. Because &sect;&sect; 123-1 and 123-2 were not in conflict, they had to be read together. The unconstitutional language could not be severed to give the remaining per se provisions a definite and permissible construction because the vague language affected the content of the entire ordinance. The entire ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of willfully participating in a criminal act for the benefit of a criminal street gang of which he was a member, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-46.2. The Circuit Court of the City of Hampton (Virginia) sentenced defendant to five years, with four years three months suspended upon various conditions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he belonged to a gang whose members, individually and collectively, had engaged in the predicate criminal acts required by statute. Assuming without deciding that the trial court did not err in admitting plea agreements and related sentencing orders, the appellate court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant belonged to a &quot;criminal street gang&quot; as defined by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-46.1. Among other things, the Commonwealth's expert on area gangs testified that although the Bloods were a nationally known gang, there was also a homegrown set there merely affiliated with the Bloods, using the same ideologies, verbiage, and symbols. The evidence further established that the two people whose convictions the Commonwealth relied on as predicate criminal acts to establish the existence of a criminal street gang were not members of defendant's subset gang. Therefore, the crimes committed by those two people did not qualify as predicate criminal acts under &sect; 18.2-46.1(iii)'s definition of &quot;criminal street gang.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss was denied. Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County (Virginia) convicted defendant of possession of a controlled drug not obtained by a valid prescription, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-250. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-263 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to state a standard of proof required for him to prove he had a valid prescription, and it violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions by shifting the burden to defendant to prove his innocence. The appellate court first concluded that defendant waived the vagueness challenge by failing to argue the issue before the trial court. Next, the appellate court concluded that &sect; 18.2-263 did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to defendant. Requiring the Commonwealth to prove that defendant did not have a prescription for the drugs possessed would undermine the general prohibition intended by the legislature. The exception, a valid prescription, justified what would otherwise be criminal conduct and the presence of a valid prescription was peculiarly within the knowledge of defendant. Thus, the appellate court concluded that the presence of a valid prescription was an affirmative defense for which defendant had the burden of going forward with supporting evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg (Virginia) denied defendant's motion to suppress, a jury convicted defendant of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute pursuant to Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investigators saw defendant involved in a suspected drug transaction. Defendant drove away and then pulled over to the side of the road. The investigators pulled in behind defendant. At oral argument on appeal, defendant conceded the investigators had sufficient reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory detention and to perform a pat down. During the pat down, an investigator felt what he suspected to be drugs in defendant's pocket. The investigator then asked defendant if he intended to smoke the &quot;crack&quot; in his pocket and defendant admitted that was his plan. The appellate court found that this gave the investigator probable cause to arrest defendant for possession of cocaine, and authority to remove the bags from his pockets in a search incident to his arrest. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. Defendant was not able to show that the conviction for a lesser-included offense than that charged in the amended indictment prejudiced his defense, and the appellate court declined to invoke the ends of justice exception to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 to set aside defendant's conviction due to his asserted constructive amendment of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach (Virginia), which convicted him of harassment by computer in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-152.7:1. He argued that the Commonwealth failed to prove that venue was proper in Virginia Beach as provided by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-249.2 and that the evidence was insufficient to prove e-mails he sent to the victim were obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the Commonwealth established venue under &sect; 19.2-249.2(4) and (6). The evidence was sufficient to prove a strong presumption that the victim received the e-mails while she resided in Virginia Beach, on a computer located within Virginia Beach. Using the definition of obscene set forth in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-372, the court of appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the e-mails defendant sent were obscene. Although the e-mails contained vulgar, offensive, and sexually explicit language, defendant's use of those words, considered as a whole and in the context of the marital discord and the angry, offensive tone and purpose of the e-mails, did not establish or support a factual or legal determination that he intended an appeal to the prurient interest in sex. The e-mails were not in any way intended to arouse or appeal to sexual desire, either defendant's own or any other individual's to whom he sent the e-mails. Rather, the evidence showed that he wrote the e-mails solely to convey his anger and disgust and that he forwarded them to his family and friends to embarrass the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed defendant's conviction and dismissed the charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped for excessive window tint. The officer determined that the windshield violated the statute proscribing the degree of tinting allowable. Defendant had three outstanding arrest warrants for weapons related charges.

After two additional officers arrive, the three removed defendant and the passenger from the vehicle, took defendant into custody on the outstanding warrants, and searched defendant's person. The officers then exceeded the scope of U.S. Const. amend. IV when they conducted a search of a locked glove compartment because defendant had not access to the car at the time of the search. The Commonwealth failed to prove that defendant or his passenger had any real possibility of accessing the vehicle or the locked glove compartment at the time of the search. Further, the Commonwealth failed to prove it was reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might have been found in the vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it refused to allow him to present evidence of the victim's prior inconsistent statements. Defendant contended that he should have been allowed to present evidence that the victim told a Commonwealth's attorney that defendant &quot;touched but did not lick her chest,&quot; which was contrary to her testimony that he kissed her chest. The Commonwealth conceded that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to present evidence of the prior inconsistent statement; however, it argued that this was harmless error. The appellate court agreed that the error was harmless. Although the victim's testimony was the key to the Commonwealth's case, the record clearly demonstrated that every aspect of her testimony was corroborated by other witnesses. The testimony of the victim's sister corroborated the victim's testimony regarding the events leading up to the attack. An inmate housed with defendant corroborated the victim's testimony regarding events that occurred during the attack. Many witnesses testified to seeing the victim running naked and saying that defendant raped her. Given the other evidence, the challenged testimony was non-material.</SPAN></P>

During a search incident to arrest, officers also recovered a steak knife and a razor from defendant's pocket. The Commonwealth conceded that neither the knife nor the box cutter were weapons under &sect; 18.2-308(A). However, the trial court determined that the razor, which had a two inch long exposed blade, was a weapon within the meaning of the statute. First, defendant failed to preserve for review his argument that the term &quot;razor&quot; in &sect; 18.2-308(A) was unconstitutional vague or overbroad. Next, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant because &sect; 18.2-308(A) was clear on its face and defendant admitted that the object that he possessed was a razor. Any razor was explicitly included as a weapon in &sect; 18.2-308(A). The manner in which defendant used the razor was irrelevant to the analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg (Virginia) imposing a five-year sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.2.  The trial court denied his motion to sever the sentencing portion of &sect; 18.2-308.2 and sentence him under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-10(f). Defendant argued that the mandatory sentencing provision of  &sect; 18.2-308.2 violated Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Historically, the power of punishment was vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. The development of mandatory minimum sentences reflected the traditional legislative role in creating statewide uniformity for all sentences for the specified crimes. While the assessment of punishment was a responsibility of the judicial branch, that assessment had to be made within the bounds set by the legislature. Given the legislature's broad authority and its historical role in defining the scope of punishment available to the court, it was within the legislature's authority to prescribe a mandatory determinant sentence. Therefore, the five-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by &sect; 18.2-308.2 did not violate the constitutional provision of Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 requiring the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to sever the sentencing portion of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.2 and instead sentence him under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-10(f).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a violent felon, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Franklin County (Virginia), which imposed a term of post-release supervision pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2. On appeal, defendant argued that the imposition of a term of post-release supervision violated the separation of powers doctrine embodied in Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the mandatory post-release supervision under &sect; 19.2-295.2 violated the separation of powers doctrine because it empowered the Virginia Parole Board, an executive agency, to assess a punishment in excess of what a trial court was statutorily authorized to impose. According to defendant, the Board was not simply administering a sentence imposed by a court, but levying conditions on a judicially determined sentence in excess of what the court imposed. In rejecting this argument, the court found that the statutory scheme did not require the Board to usurp the judicial function of assessing punishment. A plain reading of &sect; 19.2-295.2 revealed that the Board did not act judicially, but acted as an administrative body to supervise a released defendant's conduct. The trial court retained the ability to assess punishment, while the Board's role was to give defendant standards for his conduct upon his release from incarceration. Defendant remained subject to the length of punishment imposed by the judiciary and not the Board. Accordingly, the court concluded that there was no unlawful violation of the constitutional provision of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg (Virginia) entered judgment, upon a jury's verdict and sentence, convicting defendant of aggravated malicious wounding, use of a firearm during a felony, and participating in a street gang, and sentencing him to a total sentence of 53 years in the penitentiary. Defendant appealed his sentence, arguing that Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.1-271, -272, did not allow jury sentencing because he was a juvenile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16 years old when he was initially charged via delinquency petitions in the juvenile court and was 17 years old at the time of his sentencing. Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-269.1(C), the juvenile court certified the felony charges to the grand jury for trial as an adult. Defendant claimed that because Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-271 did not specifically list jury sentencing, and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-272 specifically prohibited jury sentencing of juveniles, the trial court, rather than a jury, should have fixed his sentence. However, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-271, once a minor had been sentenced as an adult, which was allowed initially under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-272, that person was forever afterward treated as an adult for the purposes of criminal prosecution in Virginia. Thus, even if some degree of tension existed between the two statutes, any inconsistency was resolved by a literal reading of the statutes. Defendant had previously been tried and convicted as an adult on an unrelated charge. Therefore, &sect; 16.1-272 no longer applied to defendant. Further, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-271 permitted all adult sentencing procedures and dispositions, including jury sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer found defendant unconscious in the driver's seat of a parked vehicle. The vehicle's radio was on, but the engine was not running, and the gearshift was in park; to remove the key from the steering column, the officer had to rotate the key. Defendant's hair and clothing were disheveled, there was a strong odor of alcohol in the vehicle, a cup with clear liquid was in the center console, and an empty wine jug was in the back seat. The officer awoke defendant, who failed field sobriety tests; a certificate of analysis showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.40. On appeal, the court found no abuse of discretion from the denial of defendant's motion to bifurcate the determinations of guilt and recidivism because any potential prejudice was resolved by a limiting instruction. The court further found that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant was operating the vehicle under &sect;&sect; 18.2-266 and 18.2-270 because the key was in the ignition, it was turned so the vehicle's electrical system would work, and the vehicle's radio was turned on. The court declined to rule on defendant's constitutional claim because it was not included in his petition for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant objected to the admission of the laboratory certificate of analysis for the cocaine and marijuana that he was charged with possessing. He alleged that the admission of this certificate violated his due process and Confrontation Clause rights because he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the forensic analyst who performed the tests. Defendant neither subpoenaed the forensic analyst who prepared the laboratory certificate nor did he request that either the Commonwealth or the trial court subpoena the analyst under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-187.1. The court agreed that the laboratory certificate of drug analysis was testimonial, but found that defendant waived his right to confront the analyst by failing to subpoena the forensic analyst prior to trial or requesting that the trial court or Commonwealth do so. Therefore, the trial court correctly ruled that the laboratory certificate of drug analysis was admissible. Defendant failed to preserve his due process argument that the statutory scheme impermissibly shifted the burden of producing evidence by requiring him to call the forensic analyst.</SPAN></P>

A divided panel of the court reversed all of defendant's convictions. The Commonwealth petitioned the full court for rehearing en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress an affidavit made by the victim, which was submitted to the trial court in conjunction with her application for a preliminary protective order, and (2) failing to grant his motion to strike the charges of abduction with intent to defile and rape, as there was insufficient evidence to permit these issues to go to the jury. On appeal, the court held that the trial court incorrectly applied the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine because it did not consider whether defendant acted with the intent to prevent the victim from either testifying as a witness or seeking aid from the judicial process. However, because the court held that the statements contained in the affidavit were not testimonial, and thus, did not implicate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, the trial court's ultimate admission of the affidavit was not error. Finally, given defense counsel's concession that, with the affidavit, the evidence was sufficient to sustain his convictions for abduction with intent to defile and rape, the court held that defendant waived his argument with respect to this issue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the evidence failed to prove that his knife was a weapon within the scope of  &sect; 18.2-308.2(A). The court of appeals held that the knife defendant possessed was not a weapon. The evidence did not establish that the knife was one of the items enumerated in Va.

The knife defendant possessed was neither a &quot;switchblade&quot; knife nor a &quot;ballistic knife,&quot; and it did not match the description of a dirk or bowie knife. The record was devoid of any facts on which one could find that the knife was either designed for fighting purposes or commonly understood to be a weapon.

Although the words &quot;fucking&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot; could have sexual connotations when utilized in certain contexts, defendant's use of these words considered as a whole and in the context in which they were spoken, did not establish that the communication had as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex or went substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. Rather, defendant used the offensive words as vulgar curse or swear words to communicate his frustration, anger, contempt or disgust with the victim.

The record contained no evidence that the stop occurred late at night or even after dark. It also contained no evidence concerning the character of the neighborhood, beyond the fact that it was a Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority-owned property that sought to avoid problems with trespassers, as demonstrated by the employment of off-duty police officers to enforce trespassing restrictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond, Virginia, challenging his jury trial convictions for robbery, attempted robbery, using a firearm in the commission of a robbery or attempted robbery, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. On appeal, he contended, in part, that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to use its four peremptory strikes against African-American venirepersons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in ruling the admission of the firearms and ballistics examination certificate did not violate his right of confrontation, and that Virginia's statutory provision allowing him to call the forensics analyst--Va.

Affirming, the court held that defendant failed to present an adequate record from which the court might determine whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's challenge to the racial composition of the jury. The voir dire of the potential jurors was not transcribed. Defendant could not rely upon his unilateral assertions concerning what transpired. The court also held that, although the ballistics certificate contained testimonial hearsay, defendant waived his right to confront the preparer of the certificate. In the alternative, if defendant did not waive this right, any error in admitting the ballistics certificate was harmless on the facts of the case, in which the certificate was never actually marked as an exhibit or published to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with rape. He entered an Alford plea. The trial court accepted his plea and continued the case for five years. Under the conditions of his plea agreement, defendant was required to be on active probation during the five years. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding that he violated his probation by refusing to admit that he committed the crime during court-ordered sex offender treatment because he had entered his guilty plea while asserting his innocence and in denying his request for individual therapy. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant violated his probation. An Alford plea did not contain an implicit promise that defendant would never be required to admit his guilt. A defendant who entered an Alford plea was not an innocent person for the purposes of criminal sentencing and probation. To mitigate the possibility that an innocent person would so plead, a factual basis was required supporting the finding of guilt before an Alford plea cold be accepted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed an order by the Circuit Court of the City of Portsmouth (Virginia) that awarded custody of the parties' child to appellee mother; the father claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss a juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court) final custody order on the ground that the JDR court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father failed to appear at the initial custody hearing where the JDR court awarded temporary custody of the parties' child to the mother and supervised visitation to the father. Five days before the final custody hearing, the father filed an objection to the JDR court's jurisdiction. However, he failed to appear at the hearing. Thereafter, the father appealed the JDR court's custody determination for lack of jurisdiction. When the trial court denied the father's motion to declare the JDR court proceedings null and void, and advised him that it would hear his evidence pertaining to his appeal, the father refused to present any evidence and left the courtroom. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the father's appeal. The appellate court found, inter alia, that because the custody matter in the trial court was heard de novo, the JDR court's ruling was annulled and any issues regarding notice to the father of the initial JDR custody proceeding were rendered moot. Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the JDR court's final custody order on the grounds that the JDR court had no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Stafford County (Virginia) found defendant guilty of three counts of forcible sodomy under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.1(1), four counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor child under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-370.1, four counts of aggravated sexual battery under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.3, and one count of animate object sexual penetration under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.2. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial defendant unsuccessfully sought to present evidence of the victim's prior complaint of sexual abuse against another man. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred because the prior complaint could have provided an alternative source for the victim's apparent knowledge of sexually explicit activities. Defendant argued that, to the extent that the evidence of the prior complaint of sexual abuse was forbidden by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.7, the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him for infringing on his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the circumstances of the prior complaint were so different that the disputed evidence had no logical tendency to establish the prior incident as an alternate source of the child's sexual knowledge. The prior complaint was that when the victim was five years old, her grandmother's boyfriend placed her hand on his penis, over his clothing. This incident has no logical tendency to show the victim's prior knowledge of the physical appearance of a penis, or of the fellatio or object sexual penetration she described at trial.</SPAN></P>

During the stop, the officer handcuffed defendant, and during a pat-down search, discovered marijuana in defendant's pocket. On appeal, defendant argued that the marijuana was obtained during an illegal search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Defendant did not file a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence and did not object during the Commonwealth's case to the admissibility of the evidence seized. The appellate court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-266.2 required that an accused seeking to suppress evidence based on a Fourth Amendment violation was required to file a suppression motion no later than seven days before trial, absent good cause. Failure to follow this requirement resulted in a waiver of the constitutional challenge to the admissibility of the evidence. Thus, defendant waived his right to challenge the admissibility of the evidence. Further, defendant failed to object to the admissibility of the evidence at trial, and thus his claim was barred by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton (Virginia) convicted defendant of felonious violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-253.2. He appealed, contending that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he inflicted &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; upon the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the definition of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-283(E) was inapplicable to this case. By its terms, it applied only to &sect; 16.1-283(E), which provided for termination of the highly protected parent-child relationship. Likewise, the specifications of &quot;serious injury&quot; in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-371.1 related to the protection of children in custodial relationships. Furthermore, the statute expressly provided that the term &quot;serious injury&quot; was not limited to the enumerated specifications. Here, the victim was bruised and lacerated, bore marks on her body, and bled. She missed several days of work and suffered pain, requiring medication for an extended period of time. She had unquestionably suffered bodily injury. Using dictionaries, the court concluded that &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; as proscribed by &sect; 16.1-253.2 was one that could fairly and reasonably be deemed not trifling, grave, giving rise to apprehension, giving rise to considerable care, and attended with danger. The injuries inflicted upon the victim satisfied this definition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Albemarle County, Virginia, ruled that a &quot;trust fund tax&quot; debt due the federal government for payroll taxes, including penalty and interest, was a marital debt, subject to apportionment between appellant wife and appellee husband under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-107.3(E). The wife appealed this ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was solely responsible for the operation of a business. His wife knew he was not paying the payroll taxes due the federal government. He testified that the wife's &quot;reckless spending&quot; prevented him from paying the taxes; she denied this. The trial court held that the payroll tax liability was a marital debt because it benefited both parties; it allocated the debt between them. The appellate court noted that marital property was equated with marital debt for purposes of equitable distribution under &sect; 20-107.3. Any debt incurred by either party during a marriage was presumptively a marital debt; thus, the wife had the burden to prove the payroll taxes were the husband's separate debt. Whether a debt was marital or separate depended on who benefited from the debt, not from the failure to pay it. The trial court erred in not determining the purpose of the original debt to the IRS. Further, the trial court did not consider that the husband's failure to pay the debt exposed him to criminal liability under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7202. The trial court's ruling allowed the husband to benefit from his violation of a federal law that had potential criminal implications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling as to the wife's burden of proof was affirmed. The judgment classifying the debt as marital was reversed and the case was remand for the trial court to consider the purpose of the trust fund tax debt, as well as who benefited from it, in order to classify the debt as marital or separate.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the police had probable cause to seize the firearm and reasonable suspicion to detain defendant. The firearm, which was under the armrest of defendant's car, was sufficiently hidden to give police officers probable cause to believe the object was evidence that defendant had committed the crime of concealing a weapon. Defendant had been sitting alone in the car. Thus, the circumstances were sufficient to provide a reasonable officer with probable cause to believe that defendant had a firearm &quot;about his person.&quot; However, the police did violate defendant's rights when they asked him questions while they were handcuffing him without first informing him of his Miranda rights. The officers made it clear that defendant was not free to leave and was in custody, even before putting the handcuffs on. Therefore, defendant should have been Mirandized before he was asked potentially incriminating questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case-in-chief, defendant moved to strike the evidence on the instant DUI charge, asserting for the first time that his 1998 DUI conviction was invalid to support the offense charged because the local code section at issue, Newport News, Va., City Code &sect; 26-72, was invalid. Defendant argued that, although he failed to give the required &sect; 19.2-266.2 notice of his intent to challenge the local code section's constitutionality, the ends of justice required consideration of that issue. The appellate court disagreed. In the trial court and on appeal, defendant made no claim that he had good cause for his failure to comply with &sect; 19.2-266.2. The record did not reflect good cause. Defendant's &quot;interests of justice&quot; argument also failed. Each warrant, the one charging the instant DUI offense, and the one charging the prior DUI offense, described the offense charged and cited both the state and local code sections. Accordingly, in each instance defendant was properly informed of the nature and character of the charge against him. He was convicted and sentenced for DUI in violation of &sect; 18.2-266, the state statute, which he did not challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles held that appellant automobile distributor had violated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to ship newly introduced models to appellee dealer. The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) affirmed the Commissioner's decision. The distributor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that as directed by the Virginia Supreme Court on an earlier appeal, the Commissioner had properly focused on the actual number of vehicles the distributor allocated to the dealer, rather than on the distributor's vehicle allocation methodology. Next, because the remand of this case did not constitute the provision of new information indicating a possible statutory violation and because the Commissioner already had a legitimate basis to believe that the distributor had violated &sect; 46.2-1569(7), he was under no obligation to investigate the merits of the dealer's complaint on remand under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1573(C). Section 46.2-1569(7) did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. It did not interfere with regulatory procedures or schemes in other states, and any incidental impact on interstate commerce was not clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. Finally, &sect; 46.2-1569(7) did not violate the federal or Virginia Due Process Clauses based on vagueness. It specified a standard of conduct that was sufficiently definite to give the distributor fair warning that its conduct in not supplying the dealer with popular new models was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly communicated with two girls, who were 16-years-old or less, through use of a simultaneous text message program via computer. One of the girls contacted police, who had a detective pretend to be the second girl when communicating by computer with the defendant. After several suggestions by way of computer, defendant used the computer to arrange a meeting between him and the two girls at a hotel. Police met defendant at the hotel at the time the meeting was supposed to occur. Defendant was charged with using a communications system to solicit a person he knew, or had reason to believe, was a minor, for certain sexual offenses in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-374.3(B). After he was convicted of that charge, he questioned whether that statute was facially overbroad based on his contention that the statute prohibited free speech in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The appellate court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-374.3(B) did not prohibit speech protected by the First Amendment. It so concluded because it found the Commonwealth was permitted to prohibit the solicitation of a crime without violating the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had a child during the parties' relationship. The relationship ended, and the girlfriend filed a petition for visitation, arguing that she was a de facto parent. The court of appeals found that no appellate court in Virginia ever applied the de facto parent doctrine, and it declined to do so. The rights of third parties were protected under the &quot;person with legitimate interest&quot; provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124.2. Therefore, there was a legal framework for the protection of the interests of a child who could suffer actual harm when separated from a person with a legitimate interest, and a mechanism to litigate the concerns of the person seeking visitation. The girlfriend cited no authority that would support a principle of &quot;partial relinquishment,&quot; by which a non-parent permitted to perform child-rearing functions could assert the rights of a parent for purposes of visitation. The trial court did not plainly err when it failed to find special facts and circumstances sufficient to justify an application of the best interests standard, and it did not abuse its discretion when it found insufficient evidence to conclude that the child would suffer harm without visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been drinking, drove her pickup truck out of her employer's parking lot, &quot;shot across&quot; the road, and &quot;slammed&quot; into a stopped car. Instead of pulling over, defendant rapidly drove away. She then drove onto a curb and swerved across three lanes of traffic. As she made an abrupt right turn, she drove over another curb and struck and killed a pedestrian. The appellate court held the statutory offenses of felony homicide and aggravated involuntary manslaughter were separate statutory offenses under Blockburger, and authorized the imposition of cumulative punishments for a single course of conduct that violated each statute. The jury determined that defendant engaged in a felony hit-and-run, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-33, when she fatally struck the pedestrian and that she was driving while intoxicated and in a manner so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-36.1(B) when she struck and killed the pedestrian. While the separate criminal offenses each resulted in the death of a single victim, the convictions and punishments imposed did not violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nursing homes appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County (Virginia), which dismissed consolidated appeals of a decision of appellee Virginia Department of Health that granted a request by appellee competitor to relocate beds from one of its facilities to two others pursuant to 2005 Va. Acts 99 (Relocation Act), the uncodified predecessor of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 32.1-102.3:5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relocation requests were not subjected to the same administrative process governing other certificates of need. The Department refused to allow appellants to challenge the relocation request because they lacked standing. The circuit court accepted the standing decision and also found that no other statutory basis, either in the basic law or the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.2-4000 et seq., granted appellants standing to seek judicial review of the relocation approval. The appellate court affirmed. The Relocation Act provided a simplified process for dealing with bed relocations between nursing homes under common ownership or control. Further, it negated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 32.1-102.3, the statute under which appellants would otherwise be able to challenge the Department's actions, and gave the Department discretion to decide relocation issues unfettered by the &quot;public need&quot; factors in &sect; 32.1-102.3. Thus, appellants lacked standing to challenge the competitor's relocation request, and without that standing, appellants could not be aggrieved for purposes of judicial review under VAPA. Finally, the Relocation Act was not an unconstitutional special law.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that the facts in the affidavit sufficiently established the informant's reliability. The informant had personal contact with defendant, was present in the home no more than 72 hours before the warrant was issued, and personally observed narcotics on defendant and in the home. The trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to consolidate or dismiss the indictments.

Defendant moved to suppress the certificate of blood alcohol analysis, arguing that its admission violated his right of confrontation. The motion was denied. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in admitting the certificate into evidence. Because the breath test result was not a statement made by a witness, the Confrontation Clause did not place any restrictions on its admission. The test was not a witness capable of making statements. The result of the test was merely data produced by a machine. The trooper's opinion testimony that he complied with the approved methods of the Department of Forensic Science did not implicate the Confrontation Clause. The maintenance log for the machine was not accusatory and was essentially a business record. Section 18.2-270 did not contain an unconstitutional presumption.

Defendant argued that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based upon prosecutorial misconduct involving the investigation of the special grand jury. The court of appeals held that Va. Sup. Ct. R.3A:9(b)(1) barred defendant's argument. Because the claim concerned allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in the procedures leading up to the indictment, defendant was required to file his motion at least seven days before trial under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:9(c). However, he did not raise his motion until the day of trial. That resulted in a waiver of any objection under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:9(b)(1).

After defendant tried to flee, he was arrested. When questioned, defendant acknowledged he possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute it. He also told the officer that there was a shotgun in the trunk of the car. As a result of defendant possessing the cocaine and the shotgun, defendant was charged with violating Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4(C). Eventually, he entered a conditional guilty plea to that charge and was convicted of if after the trial court declined to dismiss the relevant indictment against him on the ground that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4(C) was void for vagueness as applied to him. The appellate court rejected his argument that the statute violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights because the statute allowed a person to be convicted of possessing firearms and controlled substances without having to prove a nexus between the firearm and controlled substance. It found that the plain language of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4(C) did not require the Commonwealth to prove such a nexus and, thus, defendant did not show that a Fourteenth Amendment violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 19.2-295.2 violated the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch because it permitted the executive branch, through the Parole Board, to impose a sentence that was previously suspended by the trial court pursuant to &sect; 19.2-295.2. The Commonwealth argued that defendant failed to make that specific argument to the trial court and that Va. Sup Ct. R. 5A:18 barred consideration of it on appeal. The court reviewed defendant's argument to the trial court and agreed. Accordingly, Rule 5A:18 barred consideration of his argument on appeal. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the ends of justice exception of Rule 5A:18 applied because defendant had ample opportunity to present his argument to the trial court, but failed to do so, and he failed to affirmatively demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over a one-year period, defendant allegedly sexually assaulted his teenage stepdaughter on three different occasions. The victim's mother did not learn about the alleged assaults until 11 years after the last alleged assault occurred. Police had the mother engage defendant in a conversation near a hidden tape recorder. The recorder captured several incriminating statements. After the tape recording was made, but before defendant was tried on charges of rape and forcible sodomy, amendments to the marital communications privilege statutes,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.2-271.2 and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-398, became effective and allowed admission of the mother's testimony and the tape recordings. After defendant was convicted in a bench trial, he argued on appeal that the trial court's retroactive application of the amended statutes violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The appellate court found that no such violation occurred because the quantum of evidence needed for a conviction had not changed and, instead, only the evidence that could be admitted had changed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because his &quot;verbal utterances&quot; were expressly excluded from the scope of the ordinance and his disorderly conduct, if any, occurred during a recess of the city council proceedings. Defendant argued that the ordinance proscribed only disorderly conduct, not disorderly speech, and that his only conduct consisted of twice refusing to leave the council chamber when asked to do so by an officer during a recess. The appellate court held that the evidence of defendant's behavior excluding the content of his utterances was sufficient to support his conviction under the ordinance. Defendant was not removed from council chamber for the utterance of any words, but rather based on the time, manner, and place in which he spoke - yelling repeatedly with his hands cupped to magnify his voice, while the mayor was attempting to speak, and after defendant had already had his turn at the podium. Such behavior was in clear violation of the restrictions set out by the mayor. The appellate court also noted that defendant only left after the officer applied pressure through a wristlock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction. The appellate court concluded that a rational jury could have found her guilty under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266(i) and (ii). Among other things, the jury could have discounted the Commonwealth's evidence of a .20 blood alcohol concentration (BAC), while also discounting the toxicologist's low-ball BAC as naively reliant on defendant's self-serving claim that she had no more than five beers that night. Therefore, defendant's challenge to a per se conviction under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266(i) failed. In addition, evidence of defendant's erratic driving, the smell of alcohol on her breath, her glassy eyes, her slurred speech, and her failure of three field sobriety tests eliminated any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting guilt under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266(ii). Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the rebuttable presumptions&quot; employed by Va. Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 18.2-269 failed because the jury was not instructed on them and the presumptions clearly did not apply to the per se violations defendant claimed to have been convicted under.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in construing &sect; 18.2-94 to include a plastic bag as a larcenous &quot;implement.&quot; The appeals court concluded that in context, the legislature intended the term &quot;implement&quot; to refer specifically to items associated with devices, instruments, equipment, or machinery as they related to an occupation or profession, but which were used to facilitate the commission of a burglary, robbery, or larceny. Based on this definition, an ordinary plastic bag, such as the one at issue, was not an &quot;implement&quot; as proscribed by &sect; 18.2-94 because it served no particular purpose in furtherance of a trade, occupation, profession, or work. The appeals court was obligated by principles of statutory construction to limit the meaning of &quot;implement&quot; according to the specific words contained in the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After her third drunk driving conviction in 1996, defendant was civilly declared an habitual offender, and her driver's license was revoked indefinitely. Undeterred, defendant continued to drive illegally and was twice convicted for driving as an habitual offender. The Commonwealth indicted defendant for driving after having been declared an habitual offender (second or subsequent offense) triggering the mandatory minimum sentence of one-year incarceration under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-357(B)(3). Defendant argued that the 1999 partial repeal created an unconstitutional anomaly by dividing recidivist drivers into two categories that violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the special laws prohibitions of Va.

The appeals court agreed, first finding that the Va. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;18.2-415(A) conduct could not be, as the statute put it, &quot;deemed to include&quot; defendant's assault on his one witness, because that action could be punishable under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-57. Second, defendant's subsection A conduct likewise could not include cursing at the off-duty police officer, because that could only be punished, if at all, as fighting words under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-416. Finally, defendant's refusal to obey said officer's lawful order to move away from the sidewalk so others could come and go from the club in an unobstructed manner could have been punished under Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found it undisputed that the police officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for public intoxication after seeing him in an inebriated condition inside the house, and learning that he intended to continue drinking and leave the residence as soon as they departed. Consequently, defendant was not entitled to suppress evidence establishing that he resisted the arrest. Because evidence of defendant's post-entry assaults on the officers were outside the scope of the exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment was not relevant to determining the lawfulness of the subsequent arrest for purposes of assessing defendant's right to resist. Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-81, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for public intoxication after seeing him in an inebriated condition and learning that he planned to leave the residence as soon as they departed. Because the arrest was lawful and defendant established no right to resist, he was properly convicted assault and battery on a police officer and obstruction of justice.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth's motion to nolle prosse the charge so a direct indictment could be brought was granted. Prior to trial on the indictment, defendant filed a motion in limine asking the court to dismiss the charge. The motion was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-266 and 18.2-269 created mandatory presumptions that offended the Due Process Clause by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof to defendant. The appellate court disagreed, holding that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266 did not establish a mandatory presumption but allowed only a permissive inference that the fact finder was free to reject. The appellate court found that the trial court properly treated &sect;&nbsp;18.2-266(i) as a permissive inference, explicitly stating so. Defendant also argued that the plain language of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;18.2-269 referencing &quot;rebuttable presumptions&quot; rendered the statute unconstitutional because it unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The appellate court disagreed, finding that &sect; 18.2-269 did not create a mandatory presumption, but allowed a permissive inference that the fact finder was free to reject. Section 18.2-269 simply shifted the burden of producing evidence, while the burden of proof remained with the Commonwealth. The trial court analyzed the statute as a permissive inference, noting that it must be read to contain permissive inferences in order to satisfy due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

It also found that his rights were not otherwise violated because he had conceded that he had been driving under the influence of alcohol and stipulated that his blood alcohol level was 0.25.</SPAN></P>

While negotiating with defendant on a telephone, defendant also told the officer that he was &quot;heavily armed.&quot; After several hours of negotiation, defendant surrendered, and the police did a protective search of the apartment where they found a gun in plain sight. The appellate court found that under the circumstances, the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by conducting a protective sweep of the apartment. The police could conclude that there was at least one loaded weapon in the area and that the gun was connected to defendant's criminal activity. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. defendant's argument that the Commonwealth must prove operability under Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother and a father appealed an order of the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria (Virginia) which, inter alia, granted them joint custody of their children, with primary custody to the mother; awarded the mother spousal support for eight years but failed to grant a reservation, awarded the mother child support of $1,999 per month, and prohibited the father from having a romantic companion stay overnight while the children were with him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended that the trial judge erred by not granting her sole custody and by not prohibiting the father from exposing the children to his homosexual lifestyle. The father challenged the imposition of visitation restrictions. The appellate court disagreed on both counts, finding that the record contained no evidence that the children suffered any harm from being in the presence of the father's companion or from the lack of stricter restraints, and that the restrictions imposed were not an abuse of discretion. Next, the appellate court concluded that the order limiting spousal support to eight years was supported by evidence that the mother had been a teacher prior the marriage and would be able to resume her career once the children were older and more self-sufficient. However, the failure to grant a reservation of the right to seek future support was an abuse of discretion, as such a grant was necessary under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-107.1(D). Finally, the appellate court concluded that, contrary to the mother's assertion, the child support awarded included additional money for the daughter's private school education and allocation of expenses based on income was not mandated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed to the extent that it failed to grant the mother a reservation of a right to seek future spousal support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had properly framed the issue with respect to the habitual offender conviction, i.e., the interpretation of the notice he received from the DMV. However, he improperly interpreted the DMV transcript to provide notice that the habitual offender determination process had begun. Properly interpreted, the transcript provided notice that he had been determined to be a habitual offender because he had already been determined to be an habitual offender years earlier. Moreover, the trial court properly exercised its factfinding discretion where it inferred that the notice defendant received was of his then-existing habitual offender status. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-460 was not unconstitutional in granting the prosecutor discretion to charge defendant's conduct as a either a misdemeanor under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-460(B) or as a felony under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-460(C).

Code &sect; 18.2-361(A), violated the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The appellate court disagreed with both contentions. Defendant lacked standing to assert that &sect; 18.2-361(A) was facially unconstitutional, and it was not unconstitutional as it applied to him. By soliciting oral sex from a minor, defendant willfully encouraged her to engage in a criminal act in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-29. As his solicitation was clearly designed to encourage her to commit that act, which would have rendered her delinquent under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-228, the evidence established that he contributed to the delinquency of a minor in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-371.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of aggravated sexual battery. Defendant was sentenced to four years imprisonment and an additional year of post-release supervision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the trial judge violated his right of due process by refusing to place his witness subpoenas under seal. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the Commonwealth proffered that its office had filed the returns for services for its witnesses in response to defendant's pretrial motion, thereby making the names of the Commonwealth's witnesses available to defendant. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by failing to set aside the verdict after an ex parte communication occurred between court personnel and the jury during deliberations. The subject communication occurred when a court employee, without informing the trial judge, denied the jury's request for an interpreter to translate a substantive piece of evidence. The appellate court held that the ex parte communication obligated the trial judge to set aside the jury verdict. The subject evidence, a recording of a police interview, was deemed important by both sides, as defendant's attorney relied on the theory that defendant's confession was false because he had been questioned before the taping began and the Commonwealth relied on the recording because it contained the confession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in admitting a certificate of analysis without requiring the testimony of the person who performed the analysis, in violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth filed certificates of analysis confirming that several of the items seized were cocaine or contained cocaine or heroin residue in a timely manner under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-187. At trial, defendant sought to exclude the certificates based on a denial of his confrontation rights. On review, the court upheld the conviction. The trial court properly denied defendant's objection to the admission of the analysis. The court held that the procedure set forth in Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1 adequately protected defendant's Confrontation Clause rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The right of defendant to confront and cross-examine was not absolute and could bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. Thus, defendant's failure to timely notify the Commonwealth of his desire to confront the analyst at trial constituted a waiver of his confrontation rights under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter and fixed his punishment at three years of imprisonment. The Circuit Court of the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, sentenced him to the three years and added a three-year term of post-release supervision pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the addition of post-release supervision violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The appellate court disagreed. As the trial court did not make any factual determinations beyond those implicit in the jury's conviction, and a statute, such as &sect; 19.2-295.2, could provide for additional components to a sentence without violating the right to a jury trial, the trial court did not violate Blakely in adding three years of post-release supervision. The legislature, in enacting &sect; 19.2-295.2, did not cede its authority to set the maximum penalty for a crime to the trial court. The mandate of &sect; 19.2-295.2, not the trial court, increased the range of punishment set by the legislature. As the sentence, including the term of post-release supervision, was within the 10-year range set by the legislature for voluntary manslaughter in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-10, it was not illegal. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2 did not, as defendant argued, direct the trial court to suspend a part of the traditional sentence, but instead directed it to add a period of post-release supervision when less than six months of the traditional sentence was suspended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions, contending that his prosecution violated his constitutional right to be free from ex post facto punishment. The appeals court disagreed. Defendant contended that the material he was found guilty of possessing was either created or last accessed in December 2000, at a time when possession of child pornography was a Class 1 misdemeanor. But, he was indicted for possession of child pornography on September 9, 2003, two months after possession of child pornography became a felony under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-374.1:1. Second, the Commonwealth met its burden of establishing that on September 9, 2003, defendant was aware of and knowingly possessed child pornographic materials on his computer and accessories, and this finding was earlier affirmed. The mere fact that some of defendant's acts proving his possession in September, 2003 occurred before the change in the law did not preclude application of the new law. The trial court found that defendant continued to possess the child pornographic images at the time of his arrest, notwithstanding the date the images were originally downloaded.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361(A) as applied to defendant's conduct. Defendant then maintained that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361(A) was unconstitutional as applied to him because Virginia had established 15 as the age of majority for consensual sexual acts and that, therefore, his oral sodomy with 16 and 17 year-old female participants was consenting behavior between adults entitled to due process protection. On appeal, the court found that Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a father, appealed judgments of the Circuit Court of Spotsylvania County (Virginia), which denied his petition for custody of his biological daughter and denied his motion for visitation with the daughter's half-brother, to whom the father had no biological ties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and defendant, the mother, were involved in a relationship for approximately four years but never married. The father served as the primary father figure for the mother's son by another man. The trial court found that the father lacked standing to seek visitation with the boy because he was not a person with a legitimate interest under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124.2. The trial court also granted the mother's petition to relocate to Florida with the daughter. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in finding that the father was not a person with a legitimate interest because the father's relationship with the boy was the functional equivalent of a former stepparent. However, the appellate court found that the error was harmless as the father failed to show that the boy would suffer actual harm if visitation were not granted. The appellate court further held that the trial court properly allowed the mother to relocate. Separating the daughter from her half-brother would have adversely affected the children's relationship. Thus, the move to Florida was in the daughter's best interest pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124.3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of petty direct summary contempt in the juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court) in Henry County and appealed to the Henry County Circuit Court (Virginia) (reviewing court).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the admission of a certificate from the JDR court setting forth the circumstances of the conviction violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The reviewing court held that defendant appealed under a statutory right to appeal, where the certificate from the JDR court was allowed into evidence and the JDR judge was prohibited from being called as a witness. The appeal was a unique statutory hearing requiring a de novo determination, rather than a trial de novo. JDR court proceedings were not criminal prosecutions within the scope of the Sixth Amendment and there was no constitutional right to trial at the JDR court and no constitutional right of appeal. As a statutory right of appeal from a petty direct summary contempt conviction was provided with the caveat that a certificate from the JDR court could be used in that appeal, the Virginia legislature could not have intended to give birth to a constitutional right to cross-examine the JDR judge at the appeal. Thus, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-459 did not implicate defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause.</SPAN></P>

The girlfriend and her young child left the apartment; defendant, who remained behind, told police by telephone that he was heavily armed and would shoot any officer who entered the premises. After he finally surrendered, officers entered the apartment without a warrant and found a firearm in plain view. The trial court held that exigent circumstances permitted police to do a protective sweep to make sure there was no one else in the apartment and to recover the firearm to protect themselves, as well as the girlfriend and her child, who would be returning to the premises. The appellate court agreed. The police had reason to believe defendant had a handgun, and they also had information indicating others were inside the apartment. The protective sweep was a quick and limited minimal intrusion that did not violate the Fourth Amendment. As the officers were lawfully in the apartment, they were entitled to seize the gun because it was in plain view. As the prosecution was not obliged under &sect; 18.2-308.2 to prove that the gun was operable, the evidence was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety guaranteed the performance of the original contracting party when that party contracted with the state transportation department to complete two construction projects. When the original contracting party defaulted on the projects, the state transportation department required the surety to complete the unfinished work.

After the construction was completed, the surety submitted a payment request for its completion of work that had been defectively done. The state transportation department denied the claim. Following an administrative hearing authorized by statute, the deputy commissioner denied the surety's claims. The trial court dismissed the surety's motions for judgment on the surety's claims for equitable subrogation due to sovereign immunity and denied the surety's motion for leave to amend. On appeal, the appellate court found that sovereign immunity barred the equitable subrogation claim but that the surety should have been allowed leave to amend to claim entitlement to recovery under the takeover agreements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants operated a small farm, raised goats and other livestock, and sold their goat cheese at a farmer's market. A food safety specialist employed by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services attempted to conduct a sanitary inspection of defendants' facilities but was refused. The inspector eventually was permitted to conduct an inspection wherein he found several objectionable conditions. Upon a return visit, defendants refused to permit any further inspection and demanded a warrant. The trial court found defendants guilty after a jury trial and fined each $ 100. The court upheld defendants' convictions upon determining that because of the state's significant interest in protecting the public health by inspecting facilities that manufacture and store food, warrantless inspections were essential to promote the specific enforcement needs of the Virginia Food Act. The court also held that the location of defendants' goat cheese manufacturing facility within the curtilage of their home did not create a Fourth Amendment protection against the administrative warrantless search since the food laws were a matter subject to close regulation.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed that the arrest violated &sect; 19.2-74.

The court held that the application of &sect; 18.2-361 to public acts of sodomy did not render it void for vagueness because the term &quot;in public&quot; was an ordinary expression with a plain meaning and that &sect; 18.2-361 was sufficiently clear to inform both citizens and law enforcement officers of what acts constituted carnal knowledge &quot;by or with the mouth.&quot; The court rejected defendant's equal protection claims because &sect; 18.2-361, on its face, did not draw distinctions between homosexual and heterosexual individuals; rather, &sect; 18.2-361 applied equally to all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went into a men's restroom located in a department store. The restroom was freely accessible to the public, including children. Defendant entered the handicapped stall. He then left it, approached a stall occupied by an undercover police officer, and peered into it. The undercover police officer asked what he wanted. Defendant then told the undercover police officer that he wanted an act of oral sodomy. The undercover police officer asked again to confirm what defendant had said and defendant repeated his request. Defendant was charged with violations of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-29, regarding solicitation, and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361, regarding crimes against nature. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and reasoned that Lawrence, which protected private consensual sodomy, did not apply because defendant's conduct was in a public place. Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea. On appeal, the appellate court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361 was not facially unconstitutional and was not unconstitutionally overbroad. It also found that defendant's Eighth Amendment challenge to his claim was waived since he had not raised it in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach (Virginia) found defendant guilty of third-offense petit larceny.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to the evidence of prior convictions under the UCMJ, arguing that the criminal convictions were not convictions under the laws of the United States for purposes of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.1. The appeals court found that the provisions of the UCMJ constituted laws of the United States and that defendant did not raise on appeal any constitutional objections in contest of his UCMJ convictions. Nor did he assert at trial any collateral attack of any kind against the presumed validity of the special courts-martial conviction orders introduced in his case. There being no such challenge, the appeals court presumed military courts understood that they, like the state courts, had the same responsibilities as did the federal courts to protect a person from a violation of his constitutional rights. The trial court did not violate &sect; 19.2-295.1 by admitting criminal convictions defendant received from special courts-martial under the UCMJ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Hanover County, Virginia, convicted defendant of possession of marijuana in a correctional facility under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53.1-203(6). Defendant appealed and contested the evidence was insufficient to prove he knowingly and intentionally possessed marijuana in a correctional facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy arrested defendant for driving under the influence and found marijuana in the vehicle. The deputy repeatedly warned defendant about the increased penalty for possession of narcotics inside the jail walls. Defendant resisted such that the deputy could not search him until they reached the jail. Officers entered defendant's cell. The pocket of the shirt that he was wearing when he was arrested contained a bag of marijuana. No one else was in the cell with defendant and the shirt had not been in the cell earlier that night. Defendant had accepted the shirt as his property. The facts permitted the trial court to find reasonably that the defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed the marijuana outside the jail, was warned against bringing it into the jail, deliberately chose to ignore the warning, and brought it into the jail. From those findings, the trial court could reasonably infer that the defendant intentionally took the marijuana into the jail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Charlottesville (Virginia), defendant was convicted of failing to re-register with the Department of State Police for inclusion in the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry in violation of Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that statutory amendments which increased both the frequency of re-registration and the penalty for failing to do so violated prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The appellate court found that defendant failed to file a transcript or statement of facts regarding the proceedings in the trial court, and it was unable to detect any error operating to defendant's detriment. While defendant sought a ruling that the amendments to the registration scheme could not have been constitutionally be applied to him, the trial court in fact convicted him of only misdemeanor failure to re-register. The evidence supported that conviction under the statutory scheme that existed at the time of defendant's 1997 sexual abuse conviction, and nothing in the record compelled the conclusion that the trial court rejected the ex post facto argument defendant advanced on appeal. Thus, defendant failed to establish a factual or legal error from which he was entitled to relief. The mere fact of his conviction for failure to re-register did not compel the conclusion that it was for failing to do so under the amended version of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On de novo appeal from the juvenile and domestic relations district court, the Circuit Court of Stafford County (Virginia) convicted defendant, a juvenile, of aggravated sexual battery of an eight-year-old boy in violation of former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.3(A)(1). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 14-year-old boy, had sexual contact with an 8-year-old boy, but no evidence suggested that defendant used violence or compulsion to overcome the victim's will. Defendant argued that former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.3(A)(1) required force, and cited former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.10(6)(b), which defined &quot;sexual abuse&quot; generally to include cases where the accused forced the complaining witness to touch the accused's genitals. The appellate court held that seemingly incongruent statutes capable of coexistence were read harmoniously so that each retained meaning and neither was rendered illusory. If such harmony was not achieved, the more specific statute took precedence over the more general one. Defendant's interpretation violated both maxims by rendering the specific distinction between Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.3(A)(1) and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.3(A)(2) meaningless through the use of one word in a general definitional provision. Former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.10(6)(b) and former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.3(A)(1) were harmonious, neither negated the other, and both retained a substantive meaning consistent with established caselaw.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, modified a prior child custody award and awarded primary physical custody of appellee father's minor daughter to him. The trial court ordered that the father and appellant grandfather were to continue to have joint legal custody (JLC) of the daughter as previously ordered. The grandfather appealed. The father cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother had not been married. The JLC was established under a consent order after the mother died. That order was based upon an agreement between the father and the grandfather. One goal of that agreement was for the father-daughter relationship to develop such that he could obtain physical custody. The father was agreed to be a fit father and so would have had a constitutional right not to consent to child custody arrangements. The constitution presumed a fit father would make a decision in the daughter's best interests. The father's consent to the JLC effectively waived that presumption for future custody arrangements. That consent distinguished Troxel. Since the grandfather had been awarded JLC, he had standing similar to that of the father to vocalize the daughter's best interests. The trial court modified the existing custodial arrangement. That modification was properly based upon the finding of a material change of circumstances and of the best interests of the daughter. Evidence indicated that the father-daughter relationship had developed and that the father was fit. Although the modification retained the JLC, it was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the sheriff was fully advised as to whether the charges against him were civil or criminal. The sheriff was also properly found to have violated Va.

The court upheld the trial court's refusal to allow the sheriff to admit evidence of impossibility in complying with the orders because impossibility was not a valid defense to his obligation to provide for courthouse security. The court also upheld the finding that the sheriff intentionally violated the orders. However, error was found with regard to permitting the trial court judge to testify.

Defendant moved to suppress inculpatory evidence found in his bedroom. The motion was denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that police unlawfully entered his mother's apartment and obtained incriminating evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The appellate court agreed that no warrant exception justified the police entry but concluded that the consent obtained thereafter was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint. The appellate court noted that the open door alone was not sufficient to justify an entry under the exigent circumstances or community caretaking exceptions. However, the appellate court also concluded that the mother's consent was voluntary. The mother was fully briefed by the police about what was going on and why they entered her apartment. At no time prior to the consent did the police recover any incriminating evidence, nor did the police detain the mother, place her in custody, threaten her with arrest, or restrict her freedom of movement. The mother's consent in no way depended upon the duration of the officers' presence in her apartment. The 10 minutes between being awakened and providing consent was not, of itself, sufficient to end the attenuation inquiry and was used by the mother to compose herself and listen to the officers.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court found the trial court properly continued defendant's trial beyond the five-month deadline in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-243 due to an investigator's inability to attend trial because of &quot;sickness.&quot; Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss. Because defendant's charged murder and conspiracy offenses each required proof of a fact that the other did not, the Blockburger test was satisfied, the charged offenses did not constitute the &quot;same offense&quot; for purposes of double jeopardy, and the imposition of consecutive sentences for defendant's convictions did not violate the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. Even though it did not allege malice, count one of the indictment informed defendant of the nature and character of the murder charge on which she was convicted and gave her adequate notice of the offense to make her defense. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant access to mental health evidence as to the friend, as the Commonwealth would have had access to those documents if they had been released.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant limited liability company (LLC) appealed the order of the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach (Virginia) affirming the suspension of its wine and beer on and off premises and mixed beverage restaurant licenses by appellee Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LLC was the holder of ABC licenses permitting wine and beer on and off the premises and allowing the sale of mixed beverages. A hearing officer found it allowed noisy or disorderly conduct upon the licensed premises, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 4.1-225(1)(h). The appeals court found that as applied to the LLC, &sect; 4.1-225(1)(h) was constitutional. The terms used in the statute described particularized acts, the occurrence of which, when measured by common practice and understanding, were deemed to violate the statute. The statute was sufficiently definite to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and not unconstitutionally vague. Whether the LLC violated the local noise ordinance was not an issue decided by the hearing officer or the lower court, so its constitutionality did not need to be addressed. There was no error in the court's finding that the city attorney representing ABC at the initial hearing acted within her authority by &quot;prosecuting&quot; the case. The record revealed no inherent bias or conflict of interest on her part. The LLC also failed to proffer any material evidence to support its requests for a rehearing and that the ABC members recuse themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied. Defendant was convicted under Va.

The Circuit Court of the City of Portsmouth (Virginia) sentenced him to five years in prison, one year and six months suspended. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Defendant's motion to suppress was based on the failure of police to issue a summons instead of effecting an arrest, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-74(A)(1), when they stopped his car and determined he was driving on a suspended license. The appellate court noted that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-74 required the detectives to issue defendant a summons and release him from custody upon securing his promise to appear unless: (1) defendant's offense was drunk driving or a specifically exempted offense, (2) defendant failed or refused to discontinue the unlawful act, (3) the detectives believed defendant was likely to disregard the summons, or (4) the detectives reasonably believed defendant was likely to cause harm to himself or to another person. As there was not proof of facts supporting application of one of these exceptions, a full custodial arrest, necessary to justify a search of the individual incident to arrest, was not permitted under the statute, and only a citation was authorized. Thus, the evidence should have been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Circuit Court of King George County (Virginia) of a misdemeanor for occupying a structure without an occupancy permit in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 36-106. The trial judge imposed a fine, ordered defendant to abate the violation, and to bring the dwelling into compliance with the King George County Building Code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's zoning and building permits were issued based upon his representation to build an additional well as provided in his application. However, defendant did not build the additional well when he built a duplex. By connecting three dwellings to a single private well, defendant was deemed by the county to be in violation of the county zoning ordinances. After several civil penalties and contempt citations, defendant refused to abate the violations and continued to rent the dwelling. Defendant testified at trial and conceded that the duplex units were continuously occupied and that he never received a certificate of occupancy for the units, which shared a well with his home on an adjoining tract. On appeal, the court found that the trial judge's failure to sign the conviction order did not deny defendant his right to due process and his right to equal protection under the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, the county's ordinance restricting the number of service connections to each well unless an exemption was obtained was both constitutional and a valid exercise of the county's zoning authority pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.2-2200 to 15.2-2327.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of York County (Virginia), which convicted him of possessing cocaine and driving on a suspended license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's deputy stopped a car driven erratically by defendant. When the deputy approached the car, he saw that the passenger appeared to be having a seizure. The officer saw, in plain view on the passenger's side of the floorboard, a pipe used to smoke crack cocaine. The deputy and his partner advised defendant of his Miranda rights and, after a search, recovered crack cocaine from defendant's pocket. Because of the condition of the passenger, the deputy released defendant; however, defendant was informed that the police would be getting a warrant for him. Several weeks later, an indictment was returned against defendant, and defendant was subsequently convicted. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because, based on the totality of the circumstances, the deputy had probable cause to arrest defendant and was authorized to search him incident to an arrest. The court noted that the deputy could have reasonably inferred that a common enterprise existed between defendant and his passenger based upon the erratic driving, the presence of the pipe in plain view, and the furtive movements as if trying to conceal something.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After failing to reregister, as required by former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-298.1 (now Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9.1-900 to 9.1-920), defendant was indicted for violating his statutory duty to register as a sex offender. Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment was denied. He pled guilty before the Circuit Court of Loudoun County (Virginia), conditioned upon the right to assert a constitutional claim on appeal. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-298.1 (now Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9.1-900 to 9.1-920) was unconstitutional because it imposed different registration burdens on in-state and out-of-state sex offenders. Under his interpretation, the statute required in-state offenders to register only if convicted or released from confinement or supervision on or after July 1, 1997 -- while out-of-state offenders had to register when entering Virginia no matter the date of their conviction or release from confinement or supervision. The appellate court concluded that even if the disparate treatment that defendant complained of truly existed, he would have no standing to challenge it. As he conceded, defendant was still serving his sentence for aggravated rape on July 1, 1997, and was not released from prison until 1999. Thus, if the registration requirements for Virginia convicts were applied to him, defendant would have had exactly the same registration duties. The alleged disparity between in-state and out-of-state sex offenders, as far as defendant was concerned, was entirely hypothetical. Thus, defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of Danville (Virginia), which convicted him of obstructing justice under Danville, Va., City Code &sect; 23-1(b), and which imposed a 12-month sentence. Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient, the trial court improperly failed to suppress evidence, he was lawfully resisting an illegal arrest, and the trial court improperly considered suppressed evidence at sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant yelled and screamed at a woman so that it was impossible for her to speak to the police officers investigating a domestic disturbance. Defendant refused to allow the officers to separate him from the woman, refused to obey an officer's instructions to keep his hands on the police car while the officer patted him down, and struggled with the officer when the officer attempted to handcuff him pursuant to an arrest. As a result defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that defendant's struggle with the officer was sufficient evidence to show that defendant intended to prevent the officers from performing their duties. Although the trial court suppressed evidence of possible cocaine found on defendant's person, the trial court properly considered defendant's violence surrounding the unlawful search. Because defendant's screaming prior to the pat-down provided the officer's with probable cause to arrest defendant under Danville, Va., City Code &sect; 23-1(a), the arrest was lawful. Because the exclusionary rule did not apply to sentencing, the trial court properly considered the suppressed evidence at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of Waynesboro (Virginia) sentenced defendant to five years in prison for violating Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4, which prohibited the possession of certain controlled substances while simultaneously possessing a firearm. Defendant appealed the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his sentencing hearing, which was held on October 22, 2003, defendant moved to be sentenced under the version of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4 that became effective on July 1, 2003. The trial court denied his motion. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in imposing the version of the statute in effect at the time the crime was committed rather than the version in effect at the time of the conviction. The newer version of the statute, a shorter sentence could have been imposed. The general rule was that statutes were prospective in the absence of an express provision by the legislature. The amended version of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4 contained no language, much less &quot;clear, explicit, and unequivocal&quot; language, indicating that its provisions should be applied retroactively. Therefore, the legislature was presumed to have intended that the amendments would operate prospectively only. The appellate court further held that under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 1-13.39:3, the amendment constituted a reenactment of the statute which had to be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, contending that: (1) Va. Code Ann. &sect; 4.1-322 violated the Eighth Amendment by imposing criminal punishment for being an alcoholic; (2) the constitutionality of &sect; 4.1-322 was predicated on outdated medical knowledge; (3) his incarceration was disproportionate to the severity of the offense; and (4) &sect; 4.1-322 violated the Equal Protection Clause by treating homeless alcoholics disparately. The appeals court disagreed. First, &sect; 4.1-322 did not punish the status of being an alcoholic but prohibited specific behavior. Second, any suggestions for changes in societal views on the causes and effects of alcoholism and their impact on the laws were to be addressed to the legislature. Third, given defendant's long history of arrests and continued failure to abide by the interdiction order, his sentence was disproportionate to the crime he committed. Finally, the record did not establish that defendant was a homeless alcoholic, and the court refused to decide whether the homeless were a suspect class. Because defendant was not homeless, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute based on this classification.</SPAN></P>

The mother's claims that the foster care review orders were void and that the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to enter those orders were also improper collateral attacks on the foster care review orders, as was the mother's claim that the juvenile court violated the her agreement with the Department when it denied the foster care review goal of &quot;placement with relative.&quot; Finally, the Department went to extraordinary efforts to offer remedial services before and after the goal was changed to &quot;placement with relative.&quot; The mother refused to admit her drug dependency, refused to follow through with counseling, and continued her abusive relationship with her partner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1989, the parties executed a property settlement agreement that was incorporated into the final divorce decree that fixed the amount of spousal support and provided that it was to cease upon the death of the husband or wife or upon the remarriage of the wife. The agreement authorized either party to later request that a court modify support upon a showing of changed circumstances. The agreement predated cohabitation bar of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-109(A). In 2002, the husband moved to terminate his spousal support obligations pursuant to &sect; 20-109(A). The trial court properly found in favor of the wife. Because the parties' agreement predated the cohabitation bar of &sect; 20-109(A), the husband had no statutory right to terminate spousal support on cohabitation grounds. To apply &sect; 20-109(A) retroactively would have amounted to an unconstitutional impairment on the wife's vested contractual right.

The appellate court held that the trial court properly weighed the mother's efforts to correct the conditions that led to the abuse. The mother attended all weekly classes, attended &quot;one-on-one&quot; sessions with the community violence services director, although they were not required, participated in individual counseling, visited the child, and requested more frequent and longer visitation. The psychologist hired by DSS testified that the mother had learned a lot from the parenting classes. The mother testified that she did not physically discipline her son and that she would be better able to watch and control him. She also said that she could leave her significant other if he ever became physically abusive. DSS failed to prove that the mother had failed to make a substantial effort to remedy the conditions that led to her son's entry into foster care.

His references to excretory functions, though utterly tasteless and rude, merely served to emphasize his belief in the attorney's cowardice. The message, taken as a whole, did not have as its dominant theme an appeal to the prurient interest in sex; nor did defendant go substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters, as set forth in the definition of &quot;obscene&quot; in Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erroneously quashed her request for issuance of a subpoena duces tecum to the city employee who issued the summons against her. The appellate court found no error, as defendant made no claim that such evidence would have been exculpatory and material and defendant failed to establish that the evidence was not available from another source; thus, there was no Brady violation. Defendant also contended that the trial court erroneously ruled that the employee who issued the summons had the authority to do so. Based on the express language of Richmond, Va., City Code &sect; 19-55.1, the appellate court found no error. As for defendant's claim that the ordinance under which she was charged was unconstitutionally vague, the appellate court concluded that the ordinance had sufficient definiteness to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and thus was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the appellate court held that, from the evidence presented, the trial judge could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the bricks on defendant's property were demolition materials, the accumulation of which violated Richmond, Va., City Code &sect; 19-52.</SPAN></P>

The owners, as owners of the strip club where the dancer worked, were also convicted of aiding and abetting the dancer's violation. They appealed, claiming their misdemeanor convictions should be overturned on various theories, including that the ordinance violated First Amendment rights, that the ordinance was overbroad, that an exception in Henrico, Va. County Code &sect; 13-107(c) for artistic performances protected their behavior, and the county lacked authority to enact the ordinance. The court found: (1) the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment because it restricted the least amount of expressive nudity possible; (2) it was not void for vagueness because it was clear in the type of behavior it restricted; (3) the ordinance was a valid expression of the county's general police power; (4) it was not selectively enforced; and (5) the evidence supported the trial judge's findings that he strip club was not a theater, so the exception for artistic performances did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district court judge convicted defendant of operating a food manufacturing plant without inspection in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 3.1-398.1. Defendant appealed. Prior to trial of her appeal, defendant moved to dismiss the charge. The motion was denied. The Circuit Court of Gloucester County (Virginia) found defendant guilty and sentenced her to pay a fine of $ 100, and serve 30 days in jail, all of which was suspended. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other things, defendant contended that because the only notice she received alleged a refusal to permit entry for inspection, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) could not report a violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 3.1-398.1 without first providing her with yet another notice and opportunity to heard. Doing so, defendant argued, effectively deprived her of due process. As defendant failed to point to a liberty or property interest of which she was deprived by VDACS merely reporting an allegation of criminal activity, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's determination that there was no deprivation of due process. In addition, the appellate court concluded that defendant was given sufficient notice to notify her of her alleged violation. Defendant also contended that the Commonwealth failed to prove that she actually manufactured cheese, versus simply selling it. The appellate court found that the evidence clearly established that defendant sold cheese, that she told the VDACS agent that she made the product, and that the label bore an address for her farm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective was conducting surveillance of a Chesterfield County motel known for drug activity when he saw a driver (defendant) and a passenger exit a car, and enter and later leave a motel room. The detective followed the car to a gas station in Colonial Heights, where the passenger exited the car, and a third man got in. The detective saw defendant and the third man engage in an apparent hand-to-hand exchange. Officers approached the car, and one saw currency and crack cocaine in defendant's hands. He was arrested and Mirandized, and admitted throwing cocaine under the car and selling some at the motel. The appellate court held that the trial court erred by finding that the arrest was illegal. When the detective saw the hand-to-hand exchange, he had a reasonable suspicion to justify detaining defendant. When the detective's fellow officer told him he saw cocaine in defendant's hand, the detective had probable cause to arrest defendant. Assuming arguendo that the detective arrested defendant for his criminal activity in Colonial Heights--not for his activity in Chesterfield County--the arrest, though it violated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-250(A), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Their property settlement agreement stated that spousal support would terminate in the event of the parties' death or the wife's remarriage. The husband filed the petition to terminate support after statutory amendments authorized termination of support upon cohabitation. The wife conceded she cohabited with another. The trial court terminated support, because the parties merged their support contract into the final decree. It concluded the agreement ceased to exist as a separate contract immune from court interference. The wife contended merger did not nullify the contractual nature of her rights arising from the agreement. The court of appeals agreed with the wife. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-109(A) mandated termination of spousal support upon proof of habitual cohabitation, unless a stipulation or contract provided otherwise. In this case, the parties agreed spousal support only terminated on death or remarriage. Nothing suggested an intention to terminate support upon cohabitation.

The appellate court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to provide him access to the records because there was no reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different if the records had been given to him. Nothing in the documents would have provided defendant with material to impeach any witnesses or further avenues of investigation of which defendant was unaware. Further, the trial court did not err in refusing to investigate the allegation of potential juror bias. Nor was defendant prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to conduct a hearing. Defendant did not allege that the juror answered a voir dire question untruthfully. Rather, he claimed a potential bias because the victim's foster mother had worked with the juror two years earlier.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court's decision infringed his free exercise right to contribute to the religious instruction of his children. The appellate court held that the decision was exclusively based on the father's bitter denunciation of the mother to the children, his eschatological threats concerning the mother and the children, and his active undermining of the ability of the mother and the children to maintain a proper and wholesome relationship. The mere fact that the father's visitation was limited to telephone contact did not prevent his sharing his religious beliefs, or hinder him from practicing his religious beliefs. The termination of the father's in-person visitation was an appropriate remedy for the father's conduct. The trial court weighed the evidence and considered the Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124.3 factors. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that the father's conduct was causing serious psychological and emotional injury to the children. The father failed to show a material change in his circumstances to require a reduction in his child support obligation as it was based on his previous, lower salary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to suppress was denied, defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4(B), and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-248.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being detained for misdemeanor trespass, defendant was advised of his Miranda rights. A police officer then asked defendant, &quot;Before I search you is there anything I need to know about?&quot; Defendant responded by stating that he had a firearm. The officer recovered a revolver, cocaine, and cash. Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress, arguing that the officer was required to release him on a summons for misdemeanor trespass. In denying the motion, the trial court found that it was reasonable for the officer to assume that defendant was not going to do what he was told to do. In disagreeing, the appellate court found that the officer had no basis for frisking defendant or effecting a full custodial arrest. The officer's question and defendant's response effectively converted the lawful non-custodial arrest into an unlawful custodial arrest. When the officer asked his question, defendant was in handcuffs and under detention for trespassing. The circumstances surrounding defendant's admission established the requisite show of authority and submission as a matter of law. Without the firearm or the cocaine, the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's boyfriend returned from work and discovered the youngest child dead in the bathtub, covered with toys, food, and a laundry basket. Following defendant's first trial, the court reversed her convictions for felony murder and felony child neglect of the youngest child. The Commonwealth amended the original indictment prior to the second trial and charged defendant with involuntary manslaughter and sought an additional indictment for felony child neglect of the older child. Defendant was convicted of both counts of felony child neglect. The appellate court affirmed. The new indictment did not reflect prosecutorial vindictiveness. The Commonwealth decided not to add the additional felony neglect charge before the first trial to avoid delaying that trial and had not requested the additional charge before the second trial until plea negotiations failed. The evidence supported both felony child neglect convictions. Defendant had created a situation where a two-year-old child, with known aggressive tendencies toward her younger sibling, was left completely unsupervised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband and wife were married in 1996 and separated in 1997. While they were separated, the wife had sexual relations with her husband and another man, and she became pregnant. The wife told her husband that he was the child's father, and the husband believed her and established a relationship with the child. The wife and her son began living with the wife's mother in 1999, but the wife allowed the husband to visit her son until a paternity test showed that the husband was not the child's biological father. When the wife refused to allow her husband to visit her son, the husband filed an action seeking court-ordered visitation. The child's biological father did not object to the husband's request for visitation rights, but the wife opposed the request. The appellate court held that (1) absent a showing that the child would suffer actual harm if the court denied the husband's request, the wife's constitutional liberty interests in raising her son took precedence over the best interests of the child; and (2) the trial court erred by finding that it would be in the best interests of the child for the husband to have visitation rights and awarding visitation rights on that basis.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the ordinance gave defendants no reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited. A concession that some activity falling within the ordinance would not be prosecuted showed defendants could not know what violated it. The ordinance vested total discretion in those charged with enforcing it, and violated the requirement for minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement. The ordinance was selectively enforced against some dancers and not others. Its focus on the content of defendants' conduct rendered its application unconstitutional. As applied, the ordinance delineated expressive conduct permitted under limited circumstances and banned other expressive conduct within the First Amendment's protection. The legislative intent underlying the ordinance was to prevent public urination and similar problems, but it was not narrowly drawn so that its incidental restriction on expressive conduct was no greater than essential to accomplish its intended purpose. The ordinance allowed defendants' conduct to be performed in another, public, venue.</SPAN></P>

The trial court followed the statutory requirements and applied them correctly. Section 18.2-67.9 was valid as applied to defendant, as there was a finding of &quot;necessity&quot; and evidence before the trial court supported that finding. The trial court found that the victim was unable to testify in open court in the presence of defendant, the jury, the judge, and the public. The finding was based on expert testimony that there was a substantial likelihood that the child would suffer severe emotional trauma from testifying. Further, credible evidence supported the trial court's finding that the victim was unavailable to testify as it was based on the testimony of two experts, whose credibility was for the trier of fact to determine. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to find that defendant was guilty of the crimes as charged, as credible evidence supported the victim's account of the events and defendant did have an opportunity to commit the acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reversal of his previous convictions, defendant was retried and convicted in a bench trial of three counts of forcible sodomy, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.1, one count of rape, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-61, and one count of producing sexually explicit material, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-374.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the victims told the police that she kept a detailed account of defendant's abuse. Defendant sought to show that the victim's contemporaneous journal, while cataloguing numerous other sexual encounters, did not mention defendant's sexual contacts with her. Defendant argued that the journal was necessary to impeach her trial testimony with her prior inconsistent statements. The trial court excluded the statements under the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.7. The appellate court found that the exclusion was in error, as the purpose of the journals was to attack credibility, and they were proper impeachment. However, the error was harmless. In the bench trial, the trial court stated that it had reviewed the journals, and had they been considered, it would not have changed the trial court's mind. In addition, the appellate court found the evidence overwhelming. There was no vindictiveness shown upon retrial, in the imposition of a greater sentence, as there was a different judge on remand, and the record showed a non-vindictive reason for the sentence. There was credible, sufficient evidence supporting the convictions, even without physical or medical evidence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-460, the phrase, &quot;to intimidate or impede any law-enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in the discharge of his duty,&quot; was independent of the phrase, &quot;to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court relating to a violation of or conspiracy to violate&quot; the specified drug-related statutes or felony offenses. Each phrase specified a separate and distinct proscription that could constitute a violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-460(C). There was no error in the trial court's determination that the plain, obvious reading of Code &sect; 18.2-460(C) provided for two separate methods of violating the subsection: (1) a knowing attempt to intimidate or impede a law enforcement officer in the performance of his duties; and (2) a knowing attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court when the conduct at issue related in some manner to the specified offenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was 14-years-old, was quickly taken into custody and read his Miranda rights. Defendant was soon read his Miranda rights again in a small interview room. He was not in handcuffs or any other restraints. Although the second reading of his rights was conducted during the early morning hours, it occurred only about two hours after the stabbing. A detective twice asked him whether he wished to have a parent present during questioning, but he declined both offers. He then made statements confessing to the murder. A juvenile court later found, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-269.1(B), that he was 14-years-old or older at the time he was charged and that probable cause existed to believe he committed the murder. Without granting him a transfer hearing, it certified the charge to a grand jury, which indicted him for murder. His motion to suppress his confession was denied. After he was convicted, the appellate court found that application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-269.1(B) without a transfer hearing did not violate his constitutional rights. It also found his waiver of rights and confession were knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.</SPAN></P>

The stepdaughter was severely bruised. The stepfather talked with an investigator about the incident and participated in the administrative proceeding. He alleged a due process violation as his name was placed in a central registry for child abusers, and he was estranged from his stepdaughter and not permitted to coach his son. On appeal, the court found that the stepfather's behavior crossed the line from discipline to physical abuse when he hit the teenage child with the paddle repeatedly over several days and with sufficient force to cause such severe bruising through her clothing. Further, the stepfather was not denied due process as the Department did not deprive the stepfather of any liberty interests without due process of law. Additionally, substantial evidence, including photographs showing the teenage child's bruising, supported the hearing officer's finding. Moreover, the hearing officer used the correct preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. Finally, the regulations and policies involved were not so vague as to render them unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle without a license. Defendant argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-81 required the officer to obtain a warrant to charge a misdemeanor offense not committed in his presence. The trial court found that because of defendant's statement, such was not necessary. On appeal, the court found that because defendant did not comply with the notice provisions of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:9 and did not show good cause, he waived any defense or objection based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the written charge upon which he was tried, including any defense or objection pursuant to Va.

Appellee local official appealed; the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, reversed, holding the TRB lacked authority to modify the use group classifications of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC). Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The home housed eight Alzheimer patients and sought R-4 classification because it claimed I-2 fire safety standards were cost-prohibitive. The TRM granted the modification request, finding that certain safeguards the home proposed, including alarms and a sprinkler system, balanced the omission of the I-2 fire protection requirements, and noted that the home &quot;nearly qualified&quot; for the residential exception to the Use Group I-1 classification, Va. Unif. State. Bldg. Code &sect; 308.2. The circuit court reversed, as the home constituted an I-2 use, and the TRB had created a new use group without the authority to do so. The appellate court agreed; under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 36-105, the only modifications permitted to the USBC were those involving the manner of construction or materials. To the extent Va. Unif. State. Bldg. Code &sect; 107.2, 13 Va. Admin. Code 5-61-41, enacted by the Housing Board, purported to authorize the TRB to modify the USBC, it exceeded the Board's statutory authority. Modifications to the provisions of the USBC covering the manner of construction or materials used in the alteration of the home had to be the functional equivalent of those expressly required by the USBC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's holding that the TRB lacked authority to modify the USBC's use group classifications, and that the home constituted an I-2 use as a matter of law, was affirmed. However, the case was remanded to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the TRB to determine whether the alterations it approved were, in fact, the functional equivalent of those expressly required by the USBC.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-270 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed and noted that defendant asserted that the prosecutor had to prove that Virginia Beach, Va., Ordinance &sect; 21-336 was substantially similar to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266. The court held that the trial court had the authority under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-265.2(A) to judicially notice the city ordinance, and the trial court stated on the record that because it dealt with the ordinance on an almost daily basis, it was sufficiently familiar with it to take judicial notice. The court held that Va.

The appellate court held that the closing argument was essentially a motion to suppress the evidence. There was no dispute that defendant failed to file a timely pretrial motion addressing the validity of his consent. The trial court did not find a good cause or ends of justice exception for defendant's failure to follow the mandated procedure. Defendant's failure to comply with the statutory requirements of Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth challenged the judgment entered, contending that the trial court erred in finding that the language &quot;clear and significant violation&quot; rendered Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-49.1(A)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. The appeals court agreed. Here, defendant's actions in taking her daughter from the father's custody and absconding with her from the jurisdiction constituted a violation of prior court order. In violation of the court order, she subsequently refused to tell the father where the child was located and refused to return her to his custody. Defendant had more than fair notice that the conduct she intentionally undertook violated the terms of the custody order. Because the terms themselves were clear and certain, there was no significant opportunity for those who were charged with the enforcement of the particular court order to act in an arbitrary manner. Being a party to domestic court action, defendant clearly knew her conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for manufacturing marijuana not for personal use by a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke (Virginia), after the denial of his motion to suppress the marijuana plants, related evidence, and incriminating statements obtained during the execution of a search warrant obtained, inter alia, after the use of a thermal imaging device.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted error in the denial of his motion to suppress, as Kyllo, finding the use of thermal imagery unconstitutional, was decided after the suppression hearing and trial, but before sentencing. The appellate court held that the evidence was admissible under the good faith exception of Leon. The search warrant was obtained after two citizens observed the marijuana plants inside defendant's home. The police corroborated the reports with a power analysis, finding an unusual amount of power consumption, which correlated with the marijuana cultivation cycle. Even excluding the information derived from thermal imaging, the affidavit did not lack indicia of probable cause. Further, at the time the magistrate issued the warrant, Kyllo had not been decided, and the appellate courts had all found the use of thermal imagery constitutional. The magistrate and officers were entitled to rely on the results of that surveillance technique when determining probable cause for the search warrant. When the officers conducted their search, they acted under authority of an apparently valid warrant. Finally, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in not recusing himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles determined appellant car supplier violated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1569(7), since it failed to provide an equitable number of vehicles to appellee car dealer, and imposed a remedy ordering the supplier to implement a new allocation methodology. The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) affirmed the violation and remanded the remedy determinations. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner found the supplier's allocation methodology discriminated against the small-volume dealer because it was based (1) on weekly sales and rounded to the next lower whole number of cars; and (2) on the dealer's customers' satisfaction, which was skewed against a dealer by its customers' inability to get cars. The appeals court determined it had jurisdiction to consider only the interlocutory final order violation determination; the remedy determination, remanded to the Commissioner for him to redetermine a remedy, remained non-final. Section 46.2-1569(7)'s equitable allocation requirement was not unconstitutionally vague; a standard of conduct was specified and comprehensible even though it was imprecise. Section 46.2-1569(7), read naturally, put a supplier on notice (fair warning) that an allocation method inherently penalizing small dealers from acquiring cars in short supply was not fair, not without prejudice, and prohibited. Section 46.2-1569(7) did not violate the Commerce Clause; it had no practical effect of controlling commercial activity wholly beyond Virginia's borders or regulating the number of vehicles a supplier could allocate in another state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court (1) denied the Commissioner's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction as it related to the supplier's breach of the law and granted it as it related to the remedy to be imposed for that breach, (2) denied the supplier's appeal and affirmed the judgment that the supplier had breached the law, and (3) dismissed the dealer's cross-appeal, contending that the Commissioner's remedy had not exceeded his authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of Petersburg, Virginia, found appellant contemnor in civil contempt for disobedience of its orders to abate a nuisance, and imposed a 10 day jail sentence. The contemnor appealed, and moved for appellate counsel and transcripts at the Commonwealth's expense. The trial court denied these requests, and the appellate court granted the contemnor a hearing on this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced the contemnor to 10 days in jail, which it agreed to suspend if he complied with its orders within 90 days. At a hearing to review the contemnor's compliance, the trial court found he was indigent, but denied his request for court-appointed counsel. In light of evidence that the contemnor failed to comply with the orders, the trial court imposed the 10-day sentence. The appellate court noted that there was no statutory right in Virginia, in civil cases, to appointed counsel at all stages of judicial review. Though the contemnor had been given a determinate sentence, he had been found guilty of civil, not criminal, contempt, since he could have avoided jail by complying with the trial court's orders. The appellate court held that, in considering the interests at stake, and in applying the Mathews balancing test, there was neither an interest of a fundamental nature, nor a proceeding so complex as to implicate equal protection or due process concerns which entitled the contemnor to court-appointed counsel to pursue his appeal of the civil contempt order. For similar reasons, he was not entitled to a transcript at the Commonwealth's expense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) which convicted him for possession of cocaine in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-250.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress because the officers detained him without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and because the search which yielded the cocaine exceeded the scope of defendant's consent. The appellate court held the encounter became a seizure when the officer told defendant he had committed a criminal offense by possessing an open container of alcohol, and the justification for the seizure ended when defendant poured out the beer at the officer's request. However, the appellate court found a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have felt free to leave or to decline the officer's request to search, and thus the seizure continued. Further, no evidence established an independent source or inevitable discovery, or that the connection between the illegal seizure and the consent was so attenuated as to dissipate the taint. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded that because the search was not supported by probable cause and defendant's consent was tainted by the illegal seizure, the search was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained credit from a jeweler by submitting an identification card containing his picture but by supplying the name, address, phone number, and social security number of another actual person.

Defendant claimed that there was no cardholder since he accessed the account before the credit card was issued. The appellate court held that when defendant used the account access number, he employed a device issued to or for the benefit of someone else. An actual plastic card was not necessary. Because the indictments charged defendant with intent to defraud the jeweler or any other person, it included the bank that ultimately extended the credit.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient to prove the misdemeanor offense with which defendant was charged, which only required proof of interference, and did not require proof of the related felony, which contained the element of endangerment of the pilot or other person. Defendant argued the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not include examples of the types of prohibited behavior, but this argument was not properly presented to the trial court under Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the statute violated his rights to due process and equal protection by discriminating on the basis of age. The trial court found the statute had a rational basis related to the legitimate governmental purpose of keeping firearms out of the hands of felons and extending the prohibition to those who committed a felony as a juvenile. Defendant had been convicted of grand larceny as a juvenile at age 15. He was 18 years old on the day that a police officer lawfully removed a firearm from his person. The appellate court noted that the purpose of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.2 was to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons and to keep firearms out of the hands of young adults who were convicted of what would have been a felony if they had been tried as adults. The appellate court found that this was a permissible public safety concern and a legitimate governmental objective. Limiting this proscription to those under 29 years of age balanced the public safety concerns with the policy of giving preferential treatment to juvenile offenders. Lifting the prohibition after 10 years as an adult mitigated the penalty or accountability for youthful crimes.</SPAN></P>

The voice mail was relevant as it concerned a message that was left a mere three days before the subject bomb threat was made and was not, therefore, so far removed in time from the charged offense as to render it irrelevant.

A police officer told defendant that the items he was selling in his store were drug paraphernalia. Defendant stated the items were for tobacco use only. Defendant did sell some scented tobacco. The officer seized some of the items and they were presented at trial against defendant. A detective testified some of the items were used for smoking marijuana, weighing marijuana, and cleaning water pipes and that he had never seen any of the objects used with simple tobacco. Defendant admitted that some of his customers might use the items they purchased for marijuana. On appeal, the court found that from the evidence presented, the trial court could have concluded that defendant sold or possessed with the intent to sell drug paraphernalia, knowing the items were either designed for illegal drug use or were intended by the buyer for such use in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-265.3. Further, the trial court had sufficient evidence to find defendant intended to sell per se drug paraphernalia and to find he knew the items were drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

While the officer wore some insignia of his office, no show of force was used when officers approached defendant's group, no weapons were drawn, only one officer approached defendant, and nothing indicated the officer asked his questions with a commanding voice or tone. The encounter was consensual. The officer discovered a razor blade in defendant's pocket and asked defendant to walk toward his vehicle, after which defendant began running. He was caught and arrested for carrying a concealed weapon -- the razor blade. The definition of a weapon which could not legally be concealed, in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308(A), included a razor. There was no requirement that a handle be attached to a razor blade to bring it within the definition of &sect; 18.2-308(A). Therefore, defendant could be arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, even though the trial court eventually dismissed that charge, and searched incident to that arrest. That search revealed defendant's possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth introduced an order indicating he had previously been convicted and sentenced to 12 months in prison. Defendant filed an unsuccessful motion to strike, but the trial court directed the Commonwealth to research the matter to confirm the felony conviction. The Commonwealth submitted a photocopy of the law in effect at the time of defendant's prior arrest, which indicated the crime was a felony. On appeal, defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to prove his prior felony conviction and that the mandatory minimum punishment statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court initially noted courts were presumed to act in accordance with the law. The appellate court held the trial court did not err by relying on the information provided by the Commonwealth because had defendant's prior conviction been a misdemeanor, he could only have been sentenced to three months in prison. The appellate court concluded defendant's remaining argument was not preserved for review because he failed to raise the issue below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the offenses used to support the determination that the driver was a habitual offender occurred at the same time. In order to support such a determination, offenses had only to arise from separate acts, rather than separate acts of driving. Therefore, separate traffic offenses occurring at the same time could support a habitual offender determination. The provision of former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-351, providing that, for a first offender, traffic offenses occurring within a six-hour period would be treated as one offense, did not violate equal protection because it did not also apply to subsequent offenders. The provision was rationally related to a legitimate government interest in not adjudging someone a habitual offender based on one act of driving. The driver attempted to call a police officer to testify as to the nonexistence of an ordinance she had been convicted of violating, which served as a basis for the habitual offender determination. The driver did not use the mechanism provided by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-386 for a court to take judicial notice of a local ordinance, so the hearsay testimony of the officer was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was barred from raising a facial constitutional challenge. An individual could only challenge the constitutionality of a law as it applied to him or her. Defendant did not establish that his own rights were infringed, therefore he had no standing to challenge the statute. The evidence supported the trial court's finding of admissibility. The trial court believed the witness's version of events. The witness's testimony provided probable cause to believe that drugs were in the apartment, and that there might be others in the apartment with access to firearms and the ability to destroy the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband and the former wife entered a 1987 marital agreement which provided the former husband's payment of spousal support would only terminate upon the death of either party or upon the former wife's remarriage. In 1997, the state legislature modified Va. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-109(A). After modification, the trial court was permitted to terminate spousal support if it was presented with clear and convincing evidence that the spouse receiving the support had been habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to marriage for one year or more. The former husband alleged the former wife had been so cohabitating and requested that her spousal support be terminated. After the trial court declined to terminate the spousal support, the appellate court found the trial court could not have terminated the former wife's spousal support as the parties' 1987 agreement only provided for termination of support upon the death of either party or the former wife's remarriage, neither of which had occurred. It further found it could not use the statute to terminate the support as to do so would unconstitutionally impair a contract, the 1987 agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father repeatedly battered his child's mother, who moved into a battered spouse shelter and left the child in the couple's custody, where he remained for almost two years. Evidence showed that the child thrived in the couple's care. The father suffered from depression and anxiety and schizoid personality disorders, was unable to hold a job, and was violent. The grandparents could not set limits with the child, who was anxious when with them. The appellate court held that these facts supported the trial court's finding that the father was unfit, and that it was in the child's best interest to be placed in the couple's custody.  Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.1-241(A) was not unconstitutional for allowing non-parents to win child custody, since there was a compelling state interest in doing so where, as here, the parent was unfit. Visitation and placement of the child until the trial court ruled on the matter did not involve state action and was, therefore, not a violation of due process. The grandparents had no standing to complain of constitutional violations of father's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the front entrance to his apartment because it was an area observable by members of the public who could approach his residence, pass by, or lawfully be upon the property. Therefore, the officers were not prohibited from approaching the apartment and knocking on the front door for the purpose of investigating the allegation of drug activity. The appellate court also found that the officers' initial contact with defendant and his brother was consensual and that the brother invited the officers into the apartment. Based on the totality of the circumstances, at the time the officers detained defendant they had the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct an investigative detention. Because the officers lawfully searched the apartment, the search warrant obtained was valid and not based on evidence impermissibly acquired. Thus, the trial court did not err by refusing to suppress the evidence. The trial court did not err in sentencing defendant and its imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence did not violate defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was banned from a housing project site after being convicted of trespass and damaging property on the site. Later, defendant was again convicted of trespass at the site. He moved to dismiss on the ground that the city housing authority's trespass policy violated U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The Richmond Circuit Court, Virginia, denied the motion and found him guilty of trespass. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found the city was not permitted to transform the public streets and sidewalks into private, non-public property simply by passing an ordinance declaring them closed, conveying them to the hosing authority, and placing signs along the streets. Thus, the streets and sidewalks surrounding housing project did not lose their public forum status when the city deeded them to the housing authority. The appellate court also found that the barment-trespass procedure inhibited a person's constitutionally protected right to remove from one place to another according to inclination and the person's right to remain in a public place of his choice. It concluded that that the barment-trespass procedure, when strictly scrutinized, was not narrowly tailored to serve the government's compelling interest and that the housing authority's privatization effort unconstitutionally infringed upon a citizen's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to lawfully be present in a public place. Accordingly, the appellate court held that the city ordinance, as enforced through the barment-trespass procedure, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The father filed a petition to set aside the adoption order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that the father was unable to read English and that he reasonably relied on the grandmother's representations that the purpose of the consent to adoption form he signed was merely to allow the grandmother access to the child's medical records. Until the grandmother told the father of the adoption over two years later, the father had no reason to know that his parental rights had been terminated. The appellate court held that the grandmother's fraud in misrepresenting to the father the effect of the consent to adoption form and in misrepresenting to the trial court the parties' living arrangements prior to the adoption constituted extrinsic fraud sufficient to require the denial of the grandmother's demurrer. The application of the time limitation imposed in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 63.1-237 was unconstitutional; the father had a fundamental right not to have his already-established relationship with his child terminated without due process. The trial court did not err in refusing father's request for visitation and appointment of a guardian ad litem for the child because, unless and until the adoption order was set aside, the father lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

He was charged with a litany of sexual crimes, including forcible sodomy and rape. He was convicted of three counts of carnal knowledge as a lesser-included offense of forcible sodomy and aggravated sexual battery as a lesser-included offense of rape. He appealed, arguing the prohibition of consensual heterosexual sodomy under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361 abridged his constitutional rights. The court dispensed with his argument noting appellant sought to extend the right to privacy and freedom of religion to cover an individual who engaged in consensual heterosexual sodomy, but concluded the facts dd not show appellant's actions involved sexual relations between two consenting adults. The court reversed in part, holding aggravated sexual battery was not a lesser-included offense of rape under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-61.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant's 15-year old nephew went to Virginia to visit appellant. Appellant gave him beer and the nephew drank until he passed out. When the nephew awoke, appellant was touching the nephew's genitals and placing the nephew's penis in appellant's mouth. Appellant admitted he performed oral sodomy on the nephew on at least two occasions, but claimed it was with the nephew's consent. At trial, appellant tendered a jury instruction that provided in part that the Commonwealth had to prove that appellant did not know that the nephew did not consent to the oral sodomy. The trial court refused to give the instruction because it did not accurately state the law appellant was charged under, &sect; 18.2-361(A). After appellant was convicted, the appellate court found the statute did not violate the Virginia Constitution as the substantive due process provisions of the Virginia Constitution did not protect appellant's act of oral sodomy on his nephew as a liberty or pursuit of happiness interest. Also, the trial court did not err in refusing to give appellant's jury instruction as consent was not an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed and held that application of the presumption to claimant's virally induced heart disease, coupled with evidence that work-related stress made claimant more susceptible to the virus and resulting heart disease, was constitutional under the Newman standard. Further, it concluded that the evidence that claimant's heart disease resulted from a virus did not prove a non-work-related cause of the heart disease sufficient to rebut the presumption because the evidence supported a finding that claimant could have contracted the virus, and more probably than not did contract it, through work-related exposure and that claimant's job stress increased his susceptibility to the virus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue raised on appeal was whether the appellant could collaterally attack his conviction because the amended indictment failed to state an offense.

At trial, appellant did not object to the Commonwealth's motion to amend the indictment. Appellant pled guilty to making a false report to a law-enforcement officer. The trial court determined that appellant fully understood the nature and effect of said plea and of the penalties that could be imposed upon a conviction. While the indictment was not expertly drawn and its language did not mirror exactly the language in the statute, the language of the indictment was supported by the citation to the code section which incorporated the statutory definition.

Code Ann. &sect; 65.2-402(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that, for police officers, hypertension or heart disease were presumed to be occupational diseases under the statute. While claimants also had non-work-related causes that contributed to the disease, because of the statutory presumption, two doctors' opinions regarding the relationship between occupational stress and heart disease were of no probative value. The evidence merely rebutted generally the underlying premise of the statute. It was error to rely, in part, on the doctors' testimonies which did no more than refute the conclusion of the statute. Another doctor had stated all risk factors, including occupational stress, were correlative; it did not compel a finding that he used the term risk factor interchangeably with the term &quot;cause.&quot; As to one of the claimants, the conclusion that that doctor spoke only of risk factors, was wrong. He opined that claimant two's occupational stress was a risk factor that could be considered a contributing factor. On remand, the commission was to reconsider that opinion, together with all the remaining evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond (Virginia) of possession of heroin and possession of a firearm while in possession of heroin. He was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment, suspended for 10 years, on the possession offense and sentenced to the mandatory 5-year term of imprisonment for the firearm offense. Defendant's appeal challenged the mandatory five-year sentence imposed under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the statute under which he was sentenced failed to proscribe a punishment for possession of a firearm while in simple possession of narcotics and that the penalty provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4 were ambiguous. Defendant was approached by two police officers, who were on routine patrol. The officers approached defendant after they observed him urinating in public. The officers searched defendant and found a .22 caliber handgun and a folded dollar bill, which contained a tan, powdery substance that spilled when the bill was unfolded. The dollar bill tested positive for heroin residue. In 1999, the Virginia Legislature imposed a minimum mandatory sentence for a violation of either offense listed in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.4. By amending the statute to proscribe a mandatory minimum sentence for either violation of the statute, the legislature merely determined that it was removing from a trial court's discretion the power to sentence the defendant within a statutorily proscribed range of punishments. The statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. The appellate court upheld the punishment scheme. Statute that proscribed a minimum mandatory sentence was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-29, 18.2-361.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their motions to dismiss the indictments against them were denied, nine defendants pled guilty and a jury convicted one defendant of solicitation to commit oral sodomy. Defendants appealed. The instant court affirmed. Defendants lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361 facially, and that statute was not unconstitutional as applied. Defendant's public conduct did not implicate privacy interests protected by U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Section 18.2-361 did not violate prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment; the court found its consciences shocked neither by defendants' sentences nor by the five-year maximum sentence provided by statute. Although &sect; 18.2-361 may have had a basis in religious values, this alone was not dispositive of whether that section violated the prohibition against an &quot;Establishment of Religion&quot; contained in Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. amend. I. Defendants failed to prove that the primary effect of &sect; 18.2-361 was to advance or inhibit religion. Nor did they prove that &sect; 18.2-361 fostered excessive governmental entanglement with religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments of conviction affirmed. As applied, the statute that made criminal oral sodomy did not impinge on defendants' privacy rights and did not violate the prohibitions against the establishment of religion and the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Police officers were required to exercise a higher degree of restraint when confronted by language or conduct which would be offensive but would not have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the language or conduct was directed. As a matter of law, defendant's words did not have the necessary direct tendency to cause an immediate, forceful, and violent reaction by a reasonable person in the position of the police officers at whom the words were directed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his present conviction for trespassing, appellant had been convicted of trespassing on the same property twice before, and of damaging property there. &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs had been placed on the property's perimeter and the police had been authorized to enforce the applicable trespass statute. Appellant had been personally served with notice that he was banned from the property and that he would be subject to arrest if he were ever seen on the premises. Despite these warnings, appellant was subsequently arrested on the property. He claimed he was there to bring pampers for his baby. Appellant's conviction was affirmed. Even assuming the district judge's questioning of appellant during trial constituted error, the trial de novo in the circuit court provided an adequate remedy. Further, housing authority's trespass policies did not violate appellant's constitutional right to freedom of association, because to the extent appellant's barment from the property interfered with his right to &quot;intimate association&quot; with family who resided at the property, such interference was reasonable, limited, and justified. Trespass statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; district court judge's questions to appellant on witness stand did not demonstrate an inappropriate bias or prejudice. Housing authority's trespass policy served a reasonable purpose and was content neutral. Finally, appellant's &quot;intimate associations&quot; in the subject property were not infringed upon by the housing authority's policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants partially burned a cross on complainants yard, which resulted in the subject prosecutions for violations of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-423 and the attendant conspiracy. Defendants contended that the statute impermissibly infringed upon expressive conduct, speech protected by U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and, therefore, was plainly unconstitutional. Manifestly, the pernicious message of cross burning conduct constituted a true threat irrespective of racial, religious, ethnic, or like characteristics peculiar to the victim. Although defendants' expressive conduct doubtless constituted speech, the prohibition of which unavoidably implicated content, the message was beyond the protection of U.S. Const. amend. I and appropriately subject to proscription by government. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-423 targeted only expressive conduct undertaken with the intent to intimidate another, conduct clearly proscribable both as fighting words and a threat of violence. The statute did not discriminate in its prohibition and was neither overbroad nor underinclusive. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; Virginia's cross burning statute did not impermissibly infringe upon expressive conduct in violation of the First Amendment because the message was beyond the protection of the First Amendment as both fighting words and a threat of violence. Thus, defendants' constitutional challenge to the statute was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under appellee's contract with Virginia agency, it was required to provide records relating to its asbestos removal, but on advice of counsel appellee refused to do so. After a hearing, appellant Virginia Board for Asbestos and Lead of the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation imposed a fine and suspended appellee's license. The trial court reversed the board's action, on the grounds that no state standard required disclosure without a warrant. Reversing this ruling, the court noted that the trial court was bound to apply the court's prior finding that appellee was contractually obligated to produce the records on demand, and that its failure to do so violated a state standard. That appellee acted in good faith, on advice of counsel, did not negate a finding that it willfully violated the law, since &quot;willful&quot; conduct was intentional conduct and may have been consistent with good faith. That multiple agencies imposed fines on appellee for similar actions did not violate the excessive fine provisions of U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the denial of his petition to terminate his spousal support obligation to appellee ex-wife, appellant ex-husband argued that the trial court erroneously determined the obligation was contractual rather than statutory in nature. Appellant contended the support obligation was alimony, and thus subject to termination based on appellee's cohabitation. Reviewing the record, the court disagreed, holding that the language of the decree establishing appellant's obligation incorporated the terms of a contractual agreement between the parties. The court then upheld the trial court's finding that appellee's cohabitation with another individual did not warrant modification under the agreement's terms., nor was the trial court permitted to use equitable principles to modify the contract's provisions. Additionally, the court held that a state law which appellant contended barred appellee's right to spousal support did not apply retroactively to parties' agreement. Thus, the court upheld the denial of appellant's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying appellant ex-husband's petition to terminate his spousal support obligation to appellee ex-wife was affirmed, as appellee's actions had not fallen within the provisions of the agreement allowing for termination of the support obligation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Prince William County Circuit Court (Virginia), convicting him of felony murder in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-33, use of a firearm in the commission of felony murder in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-53.1, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for accidentally shooting his roommate. His felony murder conviction was premised on the theory that appellant was committing the felony of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon when he shot his roommate. The court reversed appellant's felony murder conviction, having determined that there was insufficient evidence establishing a causal connection between the underlying possession felony and the accidental killing. The evidence failed to show that the roommate's accident killing occurred in furtherance of appellant's crime of possession of a firearm; therefore the killing could not have been considered within the res gestae of the possession felony. The court affirmed appellant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon based upon appellant's juvenile adjudications despite appellant's contention that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-308 was an ex post facto law because it was amended in 1996, because it was in effect when appellant was tried in juvenile court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's felony murder conviction reversed because there was insufficient evidence establishing a causal connection between appellant's underlying crime of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and the accidental killing of his roommate. Appellant's possession of a firearm by a convicted felon conviction affirmed because application of firearm statute did not amount to an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband petitioned to terminate spousal support and maintenance after he determined appellee former wife had been habitually cohabiting with a man. Appellant alleged his payments were support, not part of a contractual obligation, and thus could have been terminated through legislation enacted after the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement. The agreement provided appellant would have paid appellee a monthly specified sum unless appellee remarried or either party died. Appellant demurred to the petition. The trial court granted her demurrer. Appellant challenged that holding. The court affirmed. The court held the parties contracted to have the marital settlement agreement incorporated, but not merged, into the divorce decree. The court also held appellant could not have used legislative amendments enacted after the marital settlement agreement was signed to terminate support because doing so would have unconstitutionally impaired a contract, especially because their agreement did not mention anything about terminating support because of cohabitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the marital settlement agreement appellant former husband and appellee former wife entered into did not provide for termination of support based on appellee's cohabitation and statutory amendments could not have been applied retroactively to terminate such support because doing so involved an unconstitutional impairment of a contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for trespassing and possessing a concealed weapon, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-119, 18.2-308.2, respectively. The court granted appellant's petition for rehearing to consider his contentions that the trial court erred in refusing to give his proposed jury instruction on the claim of right defense to trespass; that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the Commonwealth's evidence because a steak knife and box-cutter found in his possession were not weapons; and that appellant's constitutional rights were violated. The court reversed the conviction for trespass based on the trial court's erroneous denial of appellant's jury instruction. Notwithstanding the fact that the jury may well have discounted the probative value of appellant's evidence, to refuse appellant's proffered instruction was reversible error. The box-cutter possessed by appellant was a weapon within reach of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-308.2. The court affirmed appellant's conviction of possessing a concealed weapon. The court found that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that appellant was engaging in criminal activity, justifying investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-370.1. Appellant was a teacher. School officials discovered evidence appellant was engaged in improper sexual encounters with two students. Accordingly, police obtained a search warrant for appellant's apartment. The warrant specifically listed written materials, including letters and diaries. While searching for photographs in appellant's diaries, officers saw written descriptions of appellant's sexual encounters. Appellant's suppression motion was denied. Appellant was convicted on 14 counts. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the suppression motion was properly denied as neither appellant's Fifth Amendment nor Fourth Amendment rights were violated because appellant voluntarily wrote the descriptions, and any search and seizure violation was subject to the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The court also held the statute covered spanking of the buttocks and that the evidence supported the convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's decision, vacated the dismissal order, and remanded the case. The court held the statute, Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee sought workers' compensation benefits after being injured while at work. The Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission) affirmed the finding of the deputy commissioner that appellants, employer and insurance carrier, had made a de facto award to appellee by paying her disability benefits for a period of four months without filing a memorandum of agreement with the commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the lower court registering and enforcing a 1980 foreign child support decree pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-88.32-.82. Appellant made 10 arguments opposing the registration. He contended there was evidence that the order to be registered was modified later, but failed to produce any order subsequently entered to support his assertion. Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding the evidence insufficient to support that defense. He contended he had an absolute defense that his son reached emancipation at the age of 18, but, under applicable New Jersey law, his son was not emancipated until he was 24 years old. Appellant contended his right to equal protection was violated because the Virginia courts enforced a vague and undefined New Jersey order. However, the court found the order was a valid order of a sister state, entitled to recognition, and promoted a legitimate state interest. Consequently, the court summarily dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court summarily affirmed the registration and enforcement decision, finding appellant failed to produce evidence to support his claim, was not entitled to state statutory protection where the forum state's law was the controlling law, and that his right to equal protection was not violated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine a witness, who was a passenger in the car, about the witness's two prior DUI convictions. The court held the trial court erroneously refused to allow cross-examination. Evidence that the witness would receive a harsher sentence because of the other convictions was probative of the witness's bias in testifying defendant was behind the wheel at the time of the accident. However, the court held the error was harmless. Evidence that defendant attempted to drive the car out of the ditch was sufficient to support the DUI conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, robbery, and other charges and alleged that the statutory cap on fees permitted to be paid to counsel appointed by the court, as set out in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-163, created a conflict of interest for defendant's counsel and unconstitutionally denied defendant the effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court held that no pretrial inquiry into the alleged conflict of interest was required since defendant's concerns about such alleged conflict, stated to a psychologist, was insufficient to obligate the court to conduct such inquiry and, given counsel's extensive level of representation at trial, it was not reasonably apparent to the trial court that an actual conflict existed. Further, the structured fee schedule, properly based on the budgetary priorities of the legislature, was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling governmental interest in providing the indigent defendant with effective assistance of counsel, and the statute was thus not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by granting the Commonwealth's motion to join his trial with a codefendant and that his conviction violated his constitutional right to freedom of association under U.S. Const. amend I. At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the defendants worked together to prepare a script for telemarketers that was misleading, which the defendant claimed may have prejudiced him because it would not have been admissible were it not for the joint trial. The court held that the assertion of antagonistic defenses was unsupported by the record. Thus, the trial court did not err by joining the trial of both defendants pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-262.1. The court also held that there was no violation of defendant's right of freedom of association under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested after the vehicle he was driving ran over two individuals outside a party he was leaving. Appellant fled the scene immediately after bystanders lifted appellant's car off of the two victims. Witnesses stated that appellant's actions appeared to be intentional. In his defense, appellant testified he did not realize he had hit anyone when he left the scene. The trial court convicted appellant, and based on two unrelated manslaughter convictions, sentenced appellant to 70 years in prison. On appeal, appellant argued the malicious wounding statute was unconstitutionally vague because the wording of the statute was susceptible to various interpretations. The court found that appellant had no standing to make a broad and general facial statutory challenge. Commonwealth's evidence was competent and sufficient to support appellant's convictions. Finally, having agreed to trial court's use of the two prior convictions, appellant's improper enhanced punishment argument was barred on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; because appellant agreed that his victim's injuries qualified as both &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;permanent&quot; injuries, appellant had no standing to attack his aggravated malicious wounding conviction based solely upon a facial constitutional challenge.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the amendment did not constitute reversible error because it narrowed the scope of the indictment and did not change the nature or character of the offense charged. Further, the court held the evidence was sufficient to prove appellant willfully caused her child to be injured. The court noted no evidence established that anyone else had care or custody of the child before multiple fresh bruises on arms, back and legs were discovered when he arrived for pre-school.

Under the totality of the circumstances, because the vehicular stop was based solely on the absence of a front license plate, there were insufficient objective facts to justify a reasonable officer's conclusion that defendant was involved in criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 59.1-76, and thus, defendant's motion to dismiss was denied; [2]-Defendant was not entitled to dismissal on the ground that the operator failed to execute the summonses where the operator had followed the method prescribed in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33.2-503, and given that &sect; 33.2-503 prescribed the specific manner of executing summonses, the General Assembly did not intend for the instant cases to fall within the ambit of Va.

As such, the debtor's constitutional rights were not violated when the clerk of the district court did not forward to the circuit court the record in the district court case, after the debtor's request to waive the appeal bond on indigency grounds was denied following a review by the district court of the financial status of the debtor.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-61(A)(iii), (B)(2) was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, was denied because the mandatory life sentence imposed on defendant was not disproportionate to the gravity of the offense as they were not passive crimes, and they threatened to cause grave harm to society; courts were in general agreement that such offenses were deserving of serious punishment and had declined to intervene on Eighth Amendment grounds in cases involving life sentences; and defendant's heinous actions were consistent with the General Assembly's rationale for the establishment of a mandatory life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were no ministers or leaders in Sikhism. The court found that this type of religious structure could not have had individuals approved under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-23. However, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-26 applied here. The bond requirement under &sect; 20-26 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 20-26 impermissibly burdened the members' religion when compared with celebrants from other religions who qualified under &sect; 20-23, and thus it was not sufficiently tailored to the government's interest. Under the plain language of &sect; 20-26, at most one person from each of these temples could have been authorized to complete the certification of marriage. This created a regulatory structure for religions that ordained ministers under &sect; 20-23 that was different from religions that did not ordain ministers under &sect; 20-26, implicating the Equal Protection Clause. Without a closer relationship between the government's interest and the qualifications of the person completing the marriage certification, the one person requirement was insufficiently narrowly tailored as required by the Equal Protection Clause and thus &sect; 20-26&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against the members on the basis of their religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee sued the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and its Commissioner, claiming the DMV's revocation of his personalized license plates violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DMV revoked petitioner's vanity plates, which read &quot;ICUHAJI,&quot; after receiving a complaint from a motorist who claimed the plates were offensive. The Commissioner affirmed the revocation. The trial court held that the fact that petitioner raised a constitutional issue did not mean that his appeal was not governed by the standards of review set forth in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.2-4027. The Commissioner was a proper party to the appeal under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.2-4026 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:1. The speech at issue was private, and Virginia's vanity-plate program was a nonpublic forum. The DMV's guidelines for issuing vanity plates were not viewpoint neutral, as they prohibited letter combinations that a reasonable person could view as socially, racially, or ethnically offensive or disparaging. The DMV asserted that the term &quot;Haji&quot; disparaged people of Middle-Eastern descent. As the guidelines would allow petitioner to praise Middle Easterners, but prohibited him from denigrating them, the guidelines were unconstitutionally viewpoint discriminatory. The Commissioner exceeded his authority under the guidelines by relying on petitioner's bumper sticker when he affirmed the DMV's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DMV's decision was reversed. On remand, it could consider whether a different prohibition of the guidelines justified revocation of the plates; otherwise, the DMV could simply return the plates to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant consented to a search of his person, during which the officer felt a wallet in defendant's back pocket. The officer asked defendant to remove the wallet, but he refused. Believing he had probable cause, the officer searched the wallet and found two methamphetamine tablets. The court held that the search of defendant's wallet was not a search incident to his arrest, because the officer did not--and under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-74, could not--arrest him for the misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana. Rather, defendant's arrest on the felony charge of possession of methamphetamine was the result of a non-consensual search. Absent a warrant, consent, or an arrest, under the circumstances of the case, the search of defendant's wallet and subsequent retrieval of the methamphetamine tablets were unreasonable and in violation of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant for a traffic violation. Perceiving that he appeared nervous, the officer called for a canine unit. A second officer arrived with the dog and removed defendant from his car. The dog alerted to the presence of drugs in or about the car. Before searching the car, the first officer searched defendant's person and found drugs. The court held that as the car was lawfully detained, the officer's order that defendant exit the car was not an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. Though the dog's alert provided probable cause to search defendant's car, it did not provide probable cause to arrest him, as he was not in the car when the dog alerted to the possible presence of drugs in or on it. Therefore, the officer's search of his person was not incident to a lawful arrest. Because a properly trained officer would not reasonably conclude he had probable cause to arrest defendant, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply. As the arrest was predicated on the products of an unlawful search, all evidence obtained in that search, as well as any statements by defendant while under arrest, had to be excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six defendants each moved to dismiss the decisions of the Charlottesville General District Court, Virginia finding them guilty of speeding in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-875. Because the defendants' cases were substantially similar to one another and shared many common elements, the cases were consolidated for decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the defendants argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-878 created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption effectively relieving the Commonwealth of Virginia of the burden of proof as to an element of a crime, the court found that it was Charlottesville, Va. Code &sect; 15-99 which established the elements of the crime, not Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-878. Each defendant was charged with traveling 50 or more mph on the Bypass's 35 mph zone. According to the plain language of the city ordinance, those acts were violations of &sect; 15-99 and were unlawful. In the instant case, the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments required the Commonwealth to prove certain facts beyond a reasonable doubt such as the speed and location of the car. But due process did not require the Commonwealth to prove that the ordinance was itself properly established. In fact, those who challenged the establishment of the speed ordinance bore the burden of proof. That burden was made even clearer by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-878 which established a rebuttable presumption that the ordinance was lawfully passed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after her birth, the child was placed with petitioners pursuant to a foster care agreement. Eighteen months later, charges were filed against one of the petitioners arising from petitioner's use of corporal punishment on the other petitioner's 8-year-old son. The child was removed from the home and was eventually placed with another foster family. Petitioners moved the court to determine the legal and physical custody of the child. The court held that it was in the best interests of the child under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124.3 to remain in her current custodial arrangement as the evidence showed that the child had bonded well with her current foster family, and there was a substantial risk that removing the child again from an established home would exacerbate, rather than mitigate, any developmental damage. The court noted that there was an entrustment agreement with the current foster family and that the family indicated that they wished to proceed with the adoption process. Since there was currently a founded complaint of abuse against one of the petitioners, the department was not permitted to approve petitioners' home as a foster or adoptive home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of Virginia, the court sought to resolve declaratory judgment actions filed by plaintiffs, a hierarchical church and its diocese, against defendants, seven dissident local churches, the local churches' amended counterclaims, and a question described regarding one local church's endowment fund. The action was related to the local churches' separation from the hierarchical church and attempt to retain property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found plaintiffs had a contractual and proprietary interest in each of the local churches that a separate polity did not possess. When the court considered the applicable statutes, deeds, constitution and canons of the hierarchical church and the diocese, the course of dealings between the parties, and applied &quot;neutral principles of law&quot; analysis, it was clear that the hierarchical church and the diocese had contractual and proprietary interests in the real and personal property of each of the local churches. Through the direct involvement of the diocese, its bishop and its personnel, plaintiffs had pervasive and controlling involvement in the churches and their properties. There was no support in the evidence for the notion that they should reasonably have expected to repay the individual congregations. The facts were at least as compelling as the facts in Norfolk Presbytery and Green and required the court to reach a similar judgment. The amended counterclaims were found to be without merit. The court also found that the vestry entitled to elect the directors of the endowment fund was the congregation recognized by the diocese.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was granted for the church and the diocese in their declaratory judgment actions and, among other relief, all real property conveyed by 41 deeds, as well as all personal property acquired by the polity up to the filing date of the declaratory judgment actions (on or about January 31, 2007 or February 1, 2007) was to be promptly conveyed to the diocese. The congregations' amended counterclaims were denied in their entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State Senator filed an action seeking a declaration that defendant Lieutenant Governor was not entitled to vote to break a tie on certain matters during the upcoming session of the General Assembly. He filed a motion for a temporary injunction pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-620 et seq. to enjoin the Lieutenant Governor from casting any tie-breaking vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court held that the Senator was unlikely to be unsuccessful on the merits because of ripeness and separation of powers under Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. No action had been taken by the Lieutenant Governor or the General Assembly. For the circuit court to intervene before the legislative process had even begun would be tantamount to issuing an impermissible advisory opinion. It was  speculative that an evenly divided Senate would vote along party lines. The circuit court could not intervene in the normal operating procedures of the Senate and enjoin one of the highest officials of the Commonwealth from performing his constitutional duties. The power of an injunction or a declaratory judgment action could not be used to force parties in disagreement to negotiate a compromise. There was no showing of irreparable harm because the Senator could not show he would actually suffer any harm at all. The Senator was unable to show that a balance of the equities weighs in his favor. Both sides could potentially be injured. The public interest would not be served by having a deadlocked Senate that was unable to agree on organization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court denied the Senator's motion for temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
