</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted first defendant of murder and attempted murder and both defendants of assault, conspiracy to murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and unlawful wearing or carrying a handgun. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) imposed an aggregate sentence of 45 years for second defendant and life imprisonment plus 50 years for first defendant. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued the trial court erred when it received a jury note and never informed them, nor their counsel, of the note, or of what, if any, response the court would give, thereby denying defendants their rights to be present at a critical stage and to provide input for the response. Because defendants and their trial counsel were completely unaware that the note was submitted to the trial court, the appellate court concluded that defendants could not have made a knowing and intelligent waiver of their right to be present or to be represented by counsel during that critical stage. As the record was absolutely silent on how the note was handled by the trial court, it was clearly reversible error. The appellate court also found that defendants were not denied their right to a speedy trial, noting, inter alia, that despite the 20-month delay, much of which was attributable to the State, defendants failed to establish that the delay impaired their ability to present their defenses. The appellate court also held that the curative instruction given after a detective stated that marijuana was collected at one defendant's home was sufficient so as not to necessitate a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for multiple counts of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual assault, kidnapping, theft, and robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. He subsequently filed a petition for post conviction relief in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland). The court granted the petition and ordered that defendant be awarded a new trial on all counts of the indictments. The State of Maryland appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State assigned error to the grant of a new trial by the postconviction court upon consideration of defendant's postconviction petition filed pursuant to the Maryland Postconviction Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 7-102 et. seq. On appeal, the court noted that, at the time of defendant's trial, Maryland law barred his claim that the trial court's advisory only instruction violated his right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the decision that Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 23 violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was dictated by existing precedent when defendant's conviction became final. Thus, the court's instructions did not sufficiently inform the jury that its function as judges of the law was limited. Moreover, the consideration by the jury of an inapplicable venue statute in an improper instruction relieved the jury of the obligation to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged offenses occurred in Maryland rather than in Washington D.C. Finally, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the improper jury instruction and failing to timely file a motion for modification of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lobbyist appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County (Marlyand), affirming the finding of the State Ethics Commission that the lobbyist knowingly and willingly violated Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-713(1) (2004). Among other things, the Commission, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-405(e), prohibited the lobbyist from engaging in lobbying activity for 10 months and imposed a $ 5,000 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the lobbyist violated Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-713(1) (2004) by being engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation that was contingent upon executive or legislative action. In upholding the Commission's decision, the appellate court concluded that the legislative intent of &sect; 15-713(1) proscribed the contracting for lobbying services by regulated lobbyists for compensation contingent upon legislative or executive action. Therefore, violation of the statute was not dependent upon the actual performance of lobbying under the contract, it was being &quot;engaged for,&quot; rather than being &quot;engaged in,&quot; lobbying for a contingency fee that was precluded by &sect; 15-713(1). The appellate court further concluded that the Commission did not err in applying Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-405 to the lobbyist regarding a fee agreement that was entered into before the effective date of the legislation because the lobbyist was engaged under the agreement for lobbying purposes for compensation contingent upon the outcome of executive action after the effective date. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the missing witness instruction was properly given.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee/cross-appellant, a third party, sought custody and moved for visitation of a child adopted by appellant/cross-appellee, the child's legal parent. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, granted the legal parent's motion for judgment, Md. Rule 2-519(b), on the issue of custody. The circuit court also found that the third party was the child's de facto parent and granted her visitation. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were involved in a romantic relationship when the legal parent adopted the child from India. The child was with the third party every day of her life until the parties' relationship ended. The third party was not allowed to see the child only because her name was not on the adoption decree. However, she met the requirements of a de facto parent and thus was entitled to visitation with her de facto daughter. Consequently, there was no error or abuse of discretion in the conclusion that, because visitation with the third party was in the child's best interest, she was entitled to visitation with her de facto daughter. The evidence showed that both parties lived with the child from 1999 to September of 2004, when the third party left the parties' home. The parties then agreed that the legal parent would be the child's custodial parent, and that the third party would have liberal visitation. Under these circumstances, the there was no clear error in the finding that the third party's evidence was insufficient to establish that the custody dispute presented exceptional circumstances and that it was not in the child's best interest to be in her legal parent's custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the order granting the third party's request for visitation, and affirmed the judgment granting the legal parent's motion for judgment on the issue of custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol, driving under the influence of alcohol per se, and driving while impaired and proceeded immediately to sentencing. The trial court (Maryland) merged the latter two convictions into the former, and sentenced defendant to one year of incarceration, all but 60 days suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation, and a fine of $ 500. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-307 (2004 Cum. Supp.), established mandatory presumptions that violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellate court held that &sect;&nbsp;10-307 set forth a permissive inference that allowed, but did not require, the trier of fact to find that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol, and therefore did not offend due process. The appellate court further rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 21-902(a)(2) (2004), concluding that it did not embody an unconstitutional mandatory presumption. By making a blood alcohol concentration level an element of the offense of driving while under the influence, &sect;&nbsp;21-902 placed upon the State the burden of proving that element. Next, the appellate court upheld the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-303(a)(2), noting that the term &quot;apprehended,&quot; which had been defined by a prior court, was not vague. Finally, the appellate court upheld the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, noting that, inter alia, the officer lawfully stopped defendant's vehicle after it hit another car.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the client. The attorney and his law firm appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney filed a federal suit for employment discrimination on behalf of the client. After litigation resulted in judgments for the client's employer, the client filed for bankruptcy. In her bankruptcy schedules, she listed a debt to the attorney for legal services as an unsecured non-priority claim. After the bankruptcy trustee released to the client any interest she had in the litigation, the client obtained, without the attorney's representation, a favorable appeal and a favorable judgment at a second trial in federal court. The attorney contended that, despite the discharge of the client's debts, an attorney's lien was valid and enforceable against the judgment which the client obtained in the second trial. On appeal, the court found that, under Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect; 10-501 (1989, 2004 Repl. Vol.), the attorney had a lien or a right to a lien on the client's cause of action, subject to a later determination of whether the attorney produced the judgment under Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect; 10-501(b) (1989, 2004 Repl. Vol.), even though the attorney did not give the notice required under Md. R. 2-652 to assert the lien when the bankruptcy was filed.</SPAN></P>

The employee claimed that the chairman terminated his employment in violation of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. The circuit court granted the chairman's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that the Commission acted illegally when it terminated his employment without notice, hearing, impartiality, or recourse for the employee, who claimed lost wages, damage to his reputation, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. The chairman claimed that the Commission was never properly served. On appeal, the court found that the chairman waived service by responding to the complaint and that the circuit court applied the motion to both appellees. The employee did not have a property interest in continued employment under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-305(a)-(b) (1993, 2004 Repl. Vol.). An alleged state-law contract right to continued employment was not so fundamental as to require substantive due process. Thus, both his procedural and substantive due process claims under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 failed. The employee's complaint sufficiently stated a claim for a violation of Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-305(b)(1)-(2) (1993, 2004 Repl. Vol.), which required termination be decided by the full Commission. The circuit court abused its discretion when it refused to allow the employee to amend his complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the procedural and substantive due process claims but reversed the decision and remanded the action regarding the statutory violations and the refusal to amend the employee's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 1-213 (2005) was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and issued a declaratory judgment that the statute was constitutional on its face and as applied. The dentist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the dentist did not file tax returns or pay taxes for several years, his license to practice was not renewed, under Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 1-213 (2005), due to his non-payment, without a hearing. The appellate court held the statute only applied where tax liabilities were &quot;undisputed,&quot; and, as the dentist did not utilize his opportunity to dispute his tax obligation in the Maryland Tax Court, he was not deprived of procedural due process. The statute afforded him all the process he was due. He said the statute denied him substantive due process because it was not rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in assuring quality dental care, but the State also had a legitimate interest in collecting taxes, to which the statute was rationally related. The fact that it was not in effect when he did not pay his tax obligations did not mean it was a prohibited ex post facto law because that prohibition only applied to criminal penalties, and, while his failure to file an income tax return was a misdemeanor, he could avoid the statute's application by satisfying, in an acceptable manner, his tax liability that could not be disputed as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then imposed the maximum sentence of 30 years in prison upon defendant. Defendant appealed the legality of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became mad at his mother and struck her 20 or 30 times. When police arrived at the residence where the mother and defendant resided, they discovered defendant inside in an incoherent state of intoxication while his mother lay dead in her bedroom. Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to second degree murder, which carried a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. In imposing that sentence, the trial court found that defendant likely would not serve all of that time but would become eligible for parole at some point. That pronouncement recognized that under Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. &sect; 7-301(c) (Cum. Supp. 2005), defendant would have to serve at least one-half of his sentence for the violent crime he committed before he would be eligible for parole. Defendant did not object at sentencing to the trial court's consideration that at some point before the sentence was concluded, defendant would become eligible for parole. On appeal of the sentence, the intermediate appellate court found that defendant waived a challenge to the sentence by not objecting at trial, but, in any event, the trial court could consider parole eligibility and good conduct credits in imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Maryland State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners (SBVME) ruled that appellee veterinarian violated Md. Code Regs. 15.14.01.04. The Secretary of the Maryland Department of Agriculture affirmed this ruling, as did the Board of Review of the Maryland Department of Agriculture (Board). The veterinarian sought review under Md. Code Ann., Agric. &sect; 2-311(e); the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) reversed. The SBVME appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an evidentiary hearing, the SBVME found that the veterinarian touched his former employee's trachea without her consent, and that such conduct was offensive and violated Md. Code Regs. 15.14.01.04. The lower court found that the Board erred in affirming this ruling because it based its decision solely on a review of the record before the SBVME; it should have conducted a de novo reexamination and taken additional evidence. The appellate court disagreed. Under Md. Code Ann., Agric. &sect; 2-310, the SBVME, not the Board, conducted contested case hearings against persons charged with violating Maryland's Veterinary Practice Act. Under Md. Code Ann., Agric. &sect; 2-405(f) and Md. Code Ann., State Gov't 10-222(h) (2004), the Board's standard of review of the SBVME's rulings was judicial, not de novo. The Board properly refused to consider facts contained in an affidavit proffered by the veterinarian, as it could not substitute its judgment for the SBVME when the latter's findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. But by accepting the affidavit, the Board may have misled the veterinarian into believing it would be considered, which might have violated his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was reversed and the case was remanded to that court for further proceedings. The lower court had full authority to remand the case to the SBVME for a new evidentiary hearing if the court properly concluded that the law so required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Maryland Board of Physicians (the Board), appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which reversed a decision of the Board that denied the application for reinstatement of medical license submitted by appellee, a doctor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board denied the doctor's application based on allegations that the doctor had committed acts that would, had he been a licensee, have violated Md.

The court first addressed the propriety of the submission of the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings, finding that such delegation was permitted. The court also clarified that it reviewed the Board's decision, not the administrative law judge's decision. As such, the court found that there was substantial evidence to support the decision of the Board in that the doctor failed to answer truthfully to two questions of the application as to whether he was ever involved in any disciplinary hearing or malpractice actions. The court noted that the Board applied the right preponderance of the evidence burden of persuasion in reaching its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the ruling of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which granted defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence seized by the police via a search warrant as a result of failing to knock on the door of the premises to be searched. Defendant was indicted by a grand jury on 10 separate counts involving controlled dangerous substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police had obtained a search warrant of a house based on probable cause that the home was being used as a distribution center for contraband heroin. When the police arrived, the only person present at the house was defendant's ultimate co-defendant, who was standing on the front steps of the home, and the front door was open. The police announced to co-defendant that they had a warrant to search the house. Co-defendant was detained and the police entered the house through the open door. Before entering, the police announced, &quot;Police. Search Warrant.&quot; They did not knock on the door, however. There was no one inside the house. There was no dispute in the case that there was an announcement. The sole issue was whether there was a knock as required by law. The court held that knocking was but a modality of announcing and was not an independent requirement under the Fourth Amendment. Further, the lack of a knock was immaterial with regard to defendant, since he was not at the house being searched and, therefore, had no standing to assert an exclusion of the evidence seized on the ground that there was a Fourth Amendment violation based on the absence of a knock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the ruling suppressing the evidence and remanded the case to the trial court for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subcontractor appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland), which dismissed its petition for a mechanic's lien against defendant owners. The building at issue was the owners' residence, which was significantly damaged by fire. The subcontractor claimed an unpaid balance of $ 69,495.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon the owners' answer to the petition, the trial court dismissed the petition, concluding that the petition failed to include a description adequate to identify the building, as required by Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-105(a)(1)(iv) (1974, 2003 Repl. Vol.). Because the subcontractor was beyond that point allowed for filing a new lien claim, the trial court further concluded that the subcontractor could not supplement the building description by amending the petition. The court found error, concluding that the subcontractor included enough information describing the owners' renovated house. The subcontractor's petition included the street addresses with street numbers and the nine-digit zip code used by the postal service and by the owners themselves, in describing the location of their home. The addresses, combined with the information in the state tax assessment print-out and the 141 photographs included, were sufficient to enable interested parties to identify the land and the building that were the subject of the lien claim. As such, the subcontractor sufficiently pled a prima facie claim for a subcontractor's mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Montgomery County trial court (Maryland), which convicted defendant of indecent exposure; illegal possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence; illegal possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a disqualifying crime; and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged defendant with indecently exposing his person in a public place. The actions that gave rise to defendant's conviction involved his exposure of himself in his girlfriend's trailer to his girlfriend's minor daughter and two of her friends. Defendant contended on appeal that in Maryland, the offense of indecent exposure can only occur in a public place and that, because the exposure took place in the confines of a private home, the element of a public place was not met. The court disagreed and held that what constitutes a public place within the meaning of the offense depends on the circumstances of the case. Under the circumstances of the case at bar, in which defendant was a guest in the residence of another and, while in an area of the home not traditionally regarded as private, he intentionally exposed himself to others, such conduct constituted indecent exposure in a public place. The court refused to construe the definition of public place so narrowly as to apply solely to places that were physically located outdoors or open to the public at large, without any restriction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of first degree assault, second degree assault, and false imprisonment. After merging the two assault convictions, the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), sentenced defendant to 10 years in prison for first degree assault and a consecutive life sentence, with all but 10 years suspended, for the false imprisonment conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court's imposition of a life sentence for common-law false imprisonment was disproportional in a way that was violative of the Eighth Amendment and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 25. The appellate court disagreed, focusing instead on the actual sentence, ten years, and not the life sentence, a substantial portion of which was suspended. The appellate court held that the imposition of a 10-year sentence for false imprisonment was not so disproportionate as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in denying defense motions for judgment of acquittal for the first degree assault charge. Specifically, defendant contended that the State failed to produce evidence from which the jury could have found that the victim suffered serious injury as that term was defined by statute. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to allow the jury to infer that defendant attempted to cause serious physical injury to the victim as, among other things, it showed that defendant punched the victim repeatedly in her face while choking her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Anne Arundel County Circuit Court (Maryland) entered a judgment that reversed a finding by an administrative law judge that appellee mother engaged in an act of &quot;indicated child abuse&quot; when she decided to impose corporal punishment on her 13-year-old son and caused an injury to her son's eye when she tried to strike the back of her son's head and he suddenly turned his head. Appellant county social services department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled that the mother of a 13-year old boy committed an act of &quot;indicated child abuse&quot; based upon factual findings that the mother: (1) decided to impose corporal punishment on her son in response to his disrespectful behavior towards her, (2) intended to strike the back of her son's head with her knuckles, as she was looking at the back of his head when she moved her hand towards him, and (3) caused an injury to her son's eye when he suddenly turned his head and was therefore struck in the face. The mother petitioned for judicial review and the trial court reversed after making findings and conclusions that led it to decide that the mother's conduct on the occasion at issue did not constitute &quot;indicated child abuse.&quot; On further review, the intermediate appellate court agreed with the trial court and found the mother's intent to strike the child on the back of the head in an attempt to discipline him did not amount to &quot;indicated child abuse&quot; even though it did result in the unintended consequence of the child being struck around the eye when he suddenly turned his head during the attempt at disciplining him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which ordered visitation with appellee grandparents with regard to the parents' three minor children. The visitation was ordered pursuant to Maryland's Grandparent Visitation Statute (GVS), Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 9-102 (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents, particularly the father, had a falling out with the grandparents and declared they would never see their grandchildren again. Prior to the conflict, the grandparents had seen the children 31 times in 30 months, despite the grandparents living 150 miles away once the parents moved as a result of a job change. The parents contended on appeal that the GVS was facially unconstitutional or, in the alternative, was unconstitutionally applied to them in that they were fit parents in an intact family. The parents asserted that the GVS was overly broad because it failed to contain language that a fit parent was presumed to make decisions in the best interest of their child and that a court must give special weight to that presumption. The court disagreed with the parents and held that &sect; 9-102 was not facially unconstitutional for failure to articulate the presumption. The court found that the fundamental right of parents to raise their children, as applied to grandparent visitation, was honored by a presumption that the parents' decision was in the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 20 years old and was living with his parents and sister in a trailer in Maryland. A peace officer in the State of Texas entered a chat room specifically used for internet trading of child pornography news and received five images from a user known as &quot;DontTestMe197,&quot; which was later verified to have been one of defendant's user names. The five images received were of young females and males engaging in sexual conduct. A search warrant of the trailer was executed wherein the police seized a computer and two disks containing child pornography images upon which defendant's 47 counts of possession were based. The jury acquitted defendant of all charges concerning the images on the hard drive. The court found no error with regard to the trial court denying defendant's motion to suppress the incriminating statements he made to the officer executing the search warrant because defendant was not in custody when he told the officer that he had been in trouble with child pornography before and his usage of screen names. The court also found that defendant admitted at trial to leaving his personal belongings in the kitchen area of the trailer where the two disks were found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, police officers, sought a declaration that a labor code passed by defendant, a city, violated a city charter amendment by wrongfully prohibiting officers of their rank from participating in collective bargaining. The city filed an answer and a counter complaint for a contrary declaration. The Circuit Court for Worcester County (Maryland) entered a declaration for the police officers. The city appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment to the city's charter allowed employees of the city police department to engage in collective bargaining. The labor code adopted by the city precluded officers of the rank of lieutenant and higher from engaging in collective bargaining. The appellate court found that the charter amendment was ambiguous. The appellate court further held that reading the charter amendment as the police officers requested would be an unreasonable interpretation of the strictures of the amendment. Such a reading plainly offended the basic principles of collective bargaining, creating unresolvable conflicts of interest both between the city and its command staff and within the command staff itself. Not only did the officers have access to confidential information regarding all issues which were likely to be the subjects of collective bargaining, but they provided guidance to the department in such matters. To permit these officers to engage in collective bargaining themselves would have placed them in a hopeless conflict of interest. The appellate court noted that the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. 152(3), clearly excluded supervisory employees from collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for the entry of a declaration in favor of the city officials.</SPAN></P>

The action stemmed from the qualifications for instate tuition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students challenged the constitutionality of the university's methods of deciding a student's domicile for purposes of qualifying for lower, instate tuition. The students, who were enrolled in professional and postgraduate degree programs at the university, brought an action against the board seeking class certification and claiming that the board violated their constitutional rights when it refused to reclassify them as instate residents. The circuit court granted the board's motion for summary judgment, but the court vacated the determination. The court stated that the board's tuition charge differential policy violated the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the holding of prior case law. The absence of uniformity in the administrators' understanding of the current tuition policy, and the absence of standards or criteria for them to use in determining whether a student had successfully rebutted the financial dependence presumption, violated the students' rights to equal protection embodied in Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the summary judgment and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings, including, in part, the determinations of whether the students' request for class certification should be granted and whether injunctive relief was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants, individually and on behalf of their minor son, sued the vaccine makers, who had manufactured pediatric vaccines or ingredients used in those vaccines, and claimed that mercury in the vaccines caused the minor son's neurological injuries. Specifically, they asserted that the vaccines caused his autism. The trial court denied the claimants' motion to dismiss without prejudice pursuant to Md. R. 2-506(b) that they filed after the claimant's only expert witness on specific causation ended his participation in the case for personal reasons, namely, that his wife wanted the expert witness to spend more time with his family. On appeal, the claimants argued that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion to dismiss without prejudice pursuant to Md. R. 2-506(b). The appellate court agreed with the claimants and reversed. The appellate court found that application of a four-factor test regarding whether a trial court should grant a motion to dismiss without prejudice pursuant to Md. R. 2-506(b) warranted reversal of the trial court's denial of that motion under all of the circumstances, including the fact that a minor's legal rights were at stake.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then sentenced defendant, and ordered as a condition of probation that defendant pay a certain amount in restitution to the company that was victimized. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in a scheme that involved the purchase of automotive parts with stolen credit card information. As a result, defendant was charged with one count of theft of property with a value of $ 500 or more. Following a jury trial, he was found guilty of that offense. The court sentenced him to time in prison and probation. The trial court also ordered, as a condition of probation, that defendant pay restitution to the victimized company. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Maryland's &quot;statutory restitution scheme&quot; and argued that the relevant restitution statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 807, violated due process. Defendant also argued that the State had not provided competent evidence of the victimized company's loss and that the State made an improper closing argument. The appellate court that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 807, read as a whole did not relieve the State of its obligation at sentencing to prove a victim's entitlement to restitution and, thus, did not offend due process, the amount of restitution ordered was not supported by competent evidence, and the State's closing argument was not improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and prison sentence ordered were affirmed, the order of restitution was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new restitution hearing.</SPAN></P>

The radiation licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The radiation licensee held several licenses and conducted operations under them. In two complaints, the state environmental agency charged the radiation licensee with regulatory violations and violations of various license conditions. In all, there were 19 categories of violations totaling about 5,341 alleged violations. Following an administrative hearing, the radiation licensee was found to have committed about 3,626 violations of license conditions and regulations. The state environmental agency imposed the administrative law judge's (ALJ) proposed penalty of $40,700. The trial court affirmed, but remanded the case to the state environmental agency solely to verify that the penalty did not exceed Md. Code Ann., Envir. &sect; 8-510(b)'s maximum of $1,000 for a single violation. On further review, the appellate court found that the state environmental agency did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in not assigning a particular dollar amount to the individual violations, since it was not required to do so, the ALJ did not commit error in not allowing evidence of fines assessed to other licensees, and Md. Code Ann., Envir. &sect; 8-510(b) was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a consumer protection firm and a computer service provider, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which granted the motion to dismiss, which was treated as a motion for summary judgment, filed by appellees, an Internet marketing company and its president. Appellants asserted violation of the Maryland Commercial Electronic Mail Act (MCEMA), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 14-3001 et seq. (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants asserted that despite its efforts to discontinue receiving spam emails from appellees, 59 additional emails were sent to appellants in one month. Upon ruling on appellees' motion to dismiss, the trial court determined that appellees had not caused tortious injury in Maryland nor had regularly conducted business within the State to have allowed it to exercise personal jurisdiction over appellees. The court disagreed and held that jurisdiction was proper and the application of the MCEMA did not offend the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that but for appellees' alleged transmission of spam, appellants would not have suffered an injury. The court also found that appellees purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business in Maryland by directly causing the emails to be sent to Maryland as to other states. The MCEMA did not violate the Commerce Clause since it addressed the conduct of spammers in targeting Maryland consumers. The trial court erred in finding no personal liability on the part of the president since he did not produce an affidavit denying his participation in the mailings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which convicted defendant of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute after a bench trial. The trial court imposed a sentence of 25 years without parole, upon a finding of subsequent offender status under Md. Code Ann., Crim. &sect; 5-608 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue raised by defendant on appeal was whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the cocaine he was convicted of possessing. Defendant's arrest arose from the police responding to an armed robbery call and the description of two black males being broadcasted on the police radio. The description stated the black males were 16 years of age, five feet tall, 150 pounds, one dark and one medium complected, fleeing on foot, with the dark-complected suspect wearing a black jacket and having a light moustache. Defendant was found nearby on foot and was startled upon seeing the police. Upon being pat down heavily because of defendant wearing a black winter coat, the cocaine was found in defendant's pocket. The court upheld the stop of defendant because, based upon the totality of the circumstances, there was a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant had committed the armed robbery. The description of the suspects was particular and defendant was found in the area where the suspects had fled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a liquor license for a new crab and seafood restaurant. The licensee was president of the entity that owned the land on which the restaurant was located. The tenant, of which the licensee was also president, rented the property and was operator of the restaurant. The applicant, an employee of the tenant, was merely to manage the liquor license. The licensee was previously issued two liquor licenses in the county for two other restaurants. Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 9-301 (2001) prohibited the same person or entity from owning an interest in two or more liquor licenses in the county. The Board ignored uncontroverted testimony that the licensee was to have an interest in the license in violation of &sect; 9-301. There was no evidence that there was a separation between the sale of food and liquor at the restaurant. Furthermore, the licensee, as president of the entity that operated the restaurant and as the employer of the applicant, was to have the power to determine the amount of alcohol the restaurant purchased, the type of alcohol it purchased, and the sale price of that alcohol. Thus, the licensee had an interest in the sale of liquor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff bank to recover funds from defendant wife allegedly transferred to her by her insolvent husband in violation of the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (MUFCA), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect;&sect; 15-201 through 15-214 (2000), the wife appealed a grant of summary judgment by the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland) in favor of the bank and a denial of her own summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's business loan from the bank was already in default when the couple, who filed their taxes jointly, received large tax refund checks. The husband turned the checks over to the wife, who deposited them in a separate account. She later claimed to have used all the funds for family needs, including the support of the husband. The court held, first, that the couple's expressed intention to own all property as tenants by the entireties did not mean the refunds were held as such property, because that expression of intention occurred long before the property was actually acquired, and tenancy by the entireties required unity of time and other elements. Therefore, the husband, while insolvent, conveyed an interest to the wife to the extent the refunds related to his income. Furthermore, the wife could not claim that she gave fair consideration for the transfer in that the husband was discharging a duty to support the family or that a subsequent transfer of cash back to him discharged her duty to support him. Modern Maryland case law no longer recognized the doctrine of necessaries, in which such expenditures were presumed to be discharging a support duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted a proposed voir dire question asking whether any prospective jurors had strong feelings concerning the use of handguns that would not allow them to be fair and impartial. The trial court declined to ask this question. This did not constitute reversible error. Defendant was accused of robbing a bank with an accomplice who brandished a gun. No analysis or weighing of issues pertaining to the gun was required by the jurors other than accepting or rejecting the State's evidence demonstrating that the gun was used. A juror's strong feelings regarding handguns would not have necessarily precluded the juror from fairly weighing the evidence in the case where there was no question relating to the reasonableness or justifiability of the use of the gun. Sufficient evidence established defendant's use of a handgun where he was convicted of armed robbery, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and first degree assault. Although defendant argued that the State did not show that the alleged handgun was a real handgun, several witnesses testified that the handgun was a gun, and the gun appeared to be real on video surveillance tape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minority political party appealed from a grant of summary judgment by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), in favor of defendant Maryland State Board of Elections. After the state's highest court had sustained, on state constitutional grounds, the party's challenge to various statutes governing the petition process, the party had sought an award of attorneys' fees as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the party's candidates were kept off the ballot for failure to satisfy certain petition signature requirements, the party had challenged the operative statutory provisions as violative of Maryland voters' state and federal constitutional rights. The Board had argued that these were reasonable ways of administering election laws in a fair manner, but Maryland's highest court had determined, without reaching any federal constitutional issues, that the provisions in question did, as applied, violate Maryland constitutional guarantees. The party then sought an award of attorneys' fees, but the Board argued that since no federal rights had been implicated, an award under a federal statute was inappropriate. The court held that under the three-part test applied to determine whether an undecided federal claim qualified a party as a prevailing one, the party's claims qualified it as prevailing. It could not be penalized in such a situation for the highest court's reluctance to decide federal claims, where the state claims were sufficient to assure its complete success. That success did not carry over, however, to claims in other cases involving other parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the party was not eligible for awards of attorneys' fees in other cases, but reversed the summary judgment and vacated the decision in the primary case before it. It remanded the matter for determination of a reasonable fee award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) finding him guilty of violating Md. Code Ann., Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court found that neither Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-705(d), requiring written notice to the Department of an address change, nor Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-721 was unconstitutionally vague. Applying the fair-notice principle, persons of ordinary intelligence and experience were afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited by Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 11-705(d), 11-721. Even though a homeless person may not have a structural residence that the person permanently occupied, that person could still comply with Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-705(d) by sending the Department written notice that the registrant no longer lived at the last noted residence of record, and by keeping the Department informed of the registrant's whereabouts. Appellant's history of compliance with &sect; 11-705(d) supported the trial judge's conclusion that he knew of the statute's requirement that he keep the Department informed of any change in his whereabouts. Homeless registrants in Maryland were not required to know in advance where they would be moving. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to convict him of violating Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-721.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of sexual offenses against his wife's eight-year-old daughter. The victim did not testify at trial. The trial court played for the jury a videotape in which the victim told a social worker about defendant's sexual offenses. Defense counsel objected on grounds that the videotape did not meet the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness requirements of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-304(e) (2001). At no time did defendant object on the grounds that the videotape violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 21. Because defendant did not object on constitutional grounds, the issue was waived. Plain error was not established. Seven days after defendant was sentenced, the United States Supreme Court decided that unavailability and a prior opportunity to cross-examine were requirements under the Confrontation Clause in order for a testimonial hearsay statement to be offered into evidence. Although federal constitutional law changed after defendant's trial, the change in the law created no new right. As such, defendant was required to object on Confrontation Clause grounds.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was entitled to judicial review under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After years in a protected civil service position, the employee was promoted to an employee-at-will administrative position. Three months later, the interim director of his social services agency terminated him, not for misconduct, but as a matter of discretion, although, after the Human Resources Department had finalized the termination, the interim director had remarked to other agency personnel on the employee's inflexible management style. The court upheld the trial court's determination that judicial review was not available. The employee had received the informal discussion/review that was customary under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-113 (2004), but that was all the review to which an employee-at-will was entitled, except in cases involving terminations for alleged misconduct. Although the employee had not preserved his constitutional challenges to the failure to provide judicial review, the court reviewed them anyway to the extent of holding that an at-will government employee did not have a protected property interest in continued employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from an incident in which defendant stabbed her estranged husband twice in his left arm after an extended argument concerning health care issues involving the parties' daughter.

The appellate court held that the doctrine in dispute applied only in cases in which a killing had occurred or in the inchoate, shadow crimes of criminal homicide, such as attempted murder and conspiracy to murder. The court held that the crime of first degree assault did not fit into this category as first degree assault was not the functional equivalent of the former crime of assault with intent to murder. Therefore, the hot blooded response to mutual combat doctrine did not apply to the instant charge, and the trial court properly declined to give the disputed jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents originally objected to issuance of the license on standard quality of life in the neighborhood grounds, but they also attempted to show that the applicants were employed by, and the land on which the building in question was owned by, various entities, all controlled by the same person, who already held two liquor licenses in the county, despite a prohibition in Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&nbsp;36E (recodified at Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety &sect; 5-306 (2003)), plaintiff attorney applied for a permit to carry a handgun. The Secretary of Maryland State Police denied the application. The attorney appealed to defendant Handgun Permit Review Board, which affirmed the denial. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) affirmed the Board's decision. The attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was a law abiding citizen. The attorney had been a member of the National Guard and received an honorable discharge. The attorney, who had previously been a prosecutor, maintained a private practice in which approximately half of his work was in divorce law. The attorney's application for a permit was denied because he had not shown, based on the results of the police investigation, good and substantial reason to wear, carry, or transport a handgun. The appellate court agreed that the attorney failed to demonstrate a good and substantial reason why he should have been granted a permit. There was no evidence that the attorney had been threatened or faced a level of danger that was higher than the average person. In addition, the state's regulation of wearing, carrying, and transporting of handguns did not violate the Second Amendment, which was not applicable to the states. Nor was there any right under the Maryland Declaration of Rights for the attorney to bear arms. In both the Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the right to bear arms meant that the militia, not the state's citizens, had such a right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), convicting him of second-degree murder and carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure in a stabbing death of a fellow teen-aged victim. He challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court's articulation of required mens rea, and the failure to instruct on imperfect self-defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and other teenagers were already involved in a fight when defendant called out to others to join the fray, and the victim responded. Using a pocket knife with folding blades, defendant stabbed the victim more than once, and a deep cut to the groin was fatal. The court held, first, that the law in Maryland had always been that specific intent to injure could be inferred from circumstantial evidence and that there was no need to show that an accused had reason to believe death was a likely result. The evidence of the circumstances and seriousness of the wound was sufficient to support conviction. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on imperfect self-defense in the absence of any evidence that the aggressor was anyone but defendant or that he had made any effort to retreat. Although defendant had not challenged his conviction of openly carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure in violation of Md. Code Ann., Crim. &sect; 4-101 (2002), the court vacated that conviction sua sponte, holding that as a matter of law the knife used in the murder fell within the penknife exception of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction but, sua sponte, vacated the judgment convicting him on the weapons charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowners appealed a grant by the Circuit Court for Queen Anne's County (Maryland) of a motion by petitioner construction contractor to compel arbitration of their disputes and a stay of the contractor's proceeding under the Maryland Mechanic's Lien Law, Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-101 et seq. (2003), pending the arbitration's outcome. The landowners argued that by filing the lien proceeding, the contractor had waived arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' dispute with the contractor renovating their historic plantation house consumed several years and involved large sums of money. Their contract contained an arbitration clause, so the litigation began when the contractor moved to compel arbitration. The landowners' counterclaims raised many other issues, and the parties continued to negotiate. The contractor filed a mechanic's lien proceeding shortly before the deadline expired, to secure its claim for payment. Noting that Maryland case law had consistently held that a contractual right to arbitration could only be waived where a party's unequivocal behavior clearly showed an intent to waive the right, the court found no such demonstration of intent on the contractor's part. A lien proceeding was not a separate cause of action, seeking to resolve the merits of a dispute in litigation--it was simply one way of seeking to secure a right to payment. If anything, the proceeding had benefited the landowners because it allowed them to engage in discovery that they would not have been entitled to in arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a Circuit Court for Wicomico County (Maryland) judgment, which convicted him of causing a life-threatening injury by motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a violation of former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 388B (1996 &amp; 2000 Cum. Supp.), recodified as Md. Code Ann., Crim. &sect; 3-211 (2002 &amp; 2004 Cum. Supp.), defendant argued that &sect; 338B was vague and ambiguous and that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not challenge the finding that he was drunk when he hit another car head-on, but he challenged his conviction of violating &sect; 388B because the statute did not contain a definition of &quot;life-threatening injury.&quot; The court held that because this was a term that could be understood in an ordinary, everyday sense, the statute was not void for vagueness. The nature of the prohibition was clear and officers would have had no difficulty enforcing it, at least in the circumstances of defendant's case, nor was it ambiguous, nor was expert testimony needed to establish violation. The everyday meaning was sufficient because one of the occupants of the other car, a 12-year-old girl riding in back, suffered a serious head injury, requiring her transport from the local hospital to a famous teaching hospital for brain surgery and several subsequent brain and reconstructive surgeries. There was simply no question that, at least as to that victim, any rational finder of fact would have found the injury to have been life-threatening.</SPAN></P>

The inmate, with knowledge of the trial date, absconded from the jurisdiction before trial. The inmate was tried in absentia, convicted, and his convictions were affirmed on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel declined to actively participate in the inmate's trial because he believed that the inmate could not get a fair trial. In denying the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief, the post-conviction court concluded that the inmate's own conduct determined the strategy of his attorney, and due to the overwhelming nature of the State's evidence, the inmate suffered no prejudicial effects from the actions of his attorney. On appeal, the inmate contended that the post-conviction court erred by failing to presume prejudice because of counsel's lack of participation at trial. The appellate court held that prejudice should not have been presumed. Among other things, the appellate court noted that counsel did participate by arguing strenuously against trying the inmate in absentia, interposing objections, and responding to numerous inquiries regarding admission of the State's exhibits. The appellate court also concluded that application of the Strickland standard was proper, and that under that test the inmate failed to show that counsel's actions were unreasonable or that the inmate suffered prejudice in light of the overwhelming evidence against the inmate.</SPAN></P>

She told her supervisor that she did not get the job because she tested positive for using marijuana. The supervisor told her supervisor about the employee's drug test and, based on that report, the warden ordered the employee to take a drug test for the corrections agency, which test the employee failed. The corrections agency then terminated the employee for the use or possession of a drug on the job under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-105(3).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at defendant's trial established that on several occasions, he left notes on the windshield of a car belonging to the victim, the mother of his child, written to the victim and to the child, as the car was parked in the driveway of their home, and that he had also been seen driving by the house. The notes to the victim and the child contained threats of violence against the victim and her child by another man. The appellate court held, first, that construing the stalking statute in defendant's favor, the terms &quot;approaching and pursuing&quot; were words of limitation, not inclusion. Nonetheless, the plain language of those terms, as defined in dictionaries, as well as legislative history that differentiated the crimes of stalking and harassment, made it clear that a course of conduct involving approaching and pursuing could be shown without establishing a pattern of approaches to the victim's person, but could be found from the evidence of defendant's initial approach in the victim's physical presence, followed by the notes, left near her home, and the drive-bys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgments of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which convicted him on jury verdict of rape, attempted rape, and assault against the victim, his young niece. He challenged the admissibility of the evidence of the child's statements to a social worker and her mother, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the propriety of the prosecutor's closing remarks to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim described the incidents to her mother and to the social worker sent by a local agency to investigate. The appellate court held that the statement given to the social worker was admissible under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-304(c) (2001), even though the social worker was also gathering evidence for use in a prosecution, because she was also performing her basic function of assuring protection of children. The victim's statement to her mother, however, should not have been admissible under Md. R. 5-802.1 to prove rape or attempted rape because it contradicted the victim's statement at trial that no vaginal penetration occurred in one of the two incidents. There was no requirement in Maryland law that the victim's statements be corroborated, but the appellate court noted that the earlier generally consistent statements were generally helpful to the jury in performing its function of assessing reliability. Finally, there was no doubt that a final argument that referred to defendant's possible future dangerousness was inappropriate, but there was no plain error shown where the jury was properly admonished.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to five years, with all but time served suspended upon condition that he complete three years of probation; he was released that day. He appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers found 62 pounds of smokeless gunpowder in defendant's home, much of it stored improperly in antifreeze bottles. There were 16,000 rounds of live ammunition, 68,000 primer caps, 22 operable rifles and handguns, and numerous unassembled weapon components such as barrels, handles, stocks, receivers, and scopes. One box contained 81 rifle barrels. Defendant lived in an &quot;inside group&quot; rowhouse; the nearest rowhouses were 20 feet away. There was testimony that if half the gunpowder exploded, the nearest rowhouse would be leveled and its occupants killed. The court found that this evidence was sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no condition of release would reasonably assure the safety of the persons residing in the rowhouses adjacent to defendant's home. The circuit court did not err in concluding that defendant should be held without bail pending trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners filed a petition under Md. Code Ann. art. 66B, &sect;&nbsp;2.09 (1957) for judicial review of ordinances, which permitted advertising signs to be placed on an arena. The landowners sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which granted the motion to dismiss of appellees, a mayor of a city and the city council, on the ground that &sect; 2.09 did not provide for an administrative appeal in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time that the city enacted the ordinances in question, it had placed a general moratorium on the construction of billboards. The ordinances enacted permitted general advertising signs to be placed on a city arena as a conditional use under the city's zoning laws. The landowners filed a petition under &sect; 2.09 for judicial review of the ordinances; however, the trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court determined that &quot;zoning action,&quot; as used in &sect; 2.09, had the same meaning as the same phrase in Md. Code Ann. art. 66B, &sect; 4.08 (1957). According to the court, zoning action meant a reclassification by the local legislative body referring to piecemeal zoning, not to comprehensive zoning or rezoning. The court found that challenges in the courts to the adoption of zoning text amendments or the adoption of comprehensive plans had to come in proceedings other than administrative appeals. Since enactment of the ordinances in question did not constitute a zoning reclassification, the court held that the alleged illegality was not reviewable on administrative appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of second degree rape, second degree sex offense, two counts of third degree sex offense, and child abuse. The Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) sentenced him to 20 years for rape, with concurrent sentences of 30 years for second degree sex offense and 10 years for each third degree sex offense, and a sentence of 15 years for child abuse, to be served consecutive to the remaining sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it refused to allow him to elicit, under the doctrine, of verbal completeness, a second statement made to a prisoner. In his first statement, defendant told the prisoner that police found semen on his daughter's panties because he pulled them down while masturbating. In his second statement, defendant alleged that he told the prisoner, in an effort to explain the injuries to the child's genital area, that his mother reported having seen the child putting Barbie dolls into her vaginal area. The appellate court concluded that the second statement was properly excluded because it was made in a separate conversation, did not explain the first statement, and was unreliable because defendant had time to reflect between the two statements. The appellate court further found no error in the denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial, noting that the erroneous admission of hearsay evidence was cured by an instruction to the jury. Finally, the appellate court found no sentencing error, as multiple punishments for child abuse and any underlying sexual offenses were authorized by the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant consumer challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which ruled that the late fees that appellee retailer levied against the consumer under two car leasing agreements were not interest payments. The consumer had brought a class action suit, alleging that the late charges levied against her violated Md. Const. art. III, &sect;&nbsp;57 and sought compensatory, injunctive, and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the late fees charged against the consumer, as a result of her late payments on her lease, were not interest payments but rather were late fees statutorily authorized by Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 14-1315 (2004). The court noted that Md. Const. art. III, &sect;&nbsp;57 called for an interest rate of six percent per annum, unless otherwise authorized by statute. Because Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 14-2002 (2004) addressed the late payments, the constitutional provision did not apply to the lease contract between the retailer and the customer. Examining the legislative intent behind &sect; 14-2002, the court determined that the legislature authorized the retailer to charge late fees greater than six percent when it enacted &sect; 14-2002, which authorized lessors to include late charges as a condition of the lease contract. The court stated that if the legislature had intended the late charges of &sect; 14-2002 to be treated as interest, subject to the constitutional limit, it would have referred to those charges as interest, not as late or delinquency charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Cecil County, Md., Department of Social Services (DSS), sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland), remanding for further proceedings a decision by an administrative law judge (ALJ) that upheld a DSS determination that appellee accused, who had not been criminally prosecuted, had committed child sexual abuse, and that his name should be entered in a central registry of child abusers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-706 (1999 &amp; 2001 Supp.) encouraged joint investigations of cases of alleged child sexual abuse. Under a joint investigating agreement, the DSS and the local sheriff's department investigated allegations that the accused abused a friend of his daughter. A statement made to deputies was tape recorded, but it was not produced at the hearing before the ALJ. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the record in such a joint investigation had to, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-701(t) (1999 &amp; 2001 Supp.), include statements gathered by all cooperating agencies, despite a narrower description of the record in social services regulations. Despite their greater procedural flexibility, Maryland administrative proceedings were required to meet basic standards of procedural due process, and the accused had never had a chance to respond to audiotaped evidence that had been reviewed by his accusers. If the ALJ found, after remand, that any impropriety had been involved in the tape's reported destruction, the accused would be entitled to a presumption that it would have been favorable to him. Otherwise, he was entitled to at most an inference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of remand. It further directed that if, upon remand, the ALJ found that the evidence not produced at the earlier proceeding had still not been produced, the accused would be entitled to an adverse inference or an adverse presumption, depending on the degree of fault found with regard to the loss or destruction.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), after a jury trial, found for the employee and awarded him $ 1,500,000 for his osteoarthritic left knee. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the employer's motion for (1) summary judgment (under limitation statute's discovery rule application and federal railroad safety and boiler acts (FRSA) issue preclusion), and (2) directed verdict (FELA evidence sufficiency close calls went to the employee). The employee's two specialist physician (including the knee surgeon) and one ergonometric experts' opinions were admissible to prove (1) how walking miles daily on the ballast and getting on and off moving trains from an elevation stressed his knees, and (2) negligence (causation and breach of duty-employer's knowledge of dangers of large ballast). &quot;Large&quot; ballast was 1 to 2.5 inches in diameter stone or rock. The doctors' use of &quot;differential diagnosis&quot; to arrive at their opinions was accepted in the medical community. The ergonomic specialist's science was also recognized. A Frye-type analysis was not required. The opinions were based on fact and well-reasoned. The experts', employee's, and other employees' testimony (describing the employer's knowledge of the dangers of large ballast), provided evidence &quot;sufficiency.&quot; Compliance with FRSA, that did not cover walkways, did not preclude FELA liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in admitting the expert opinions and the other employees' statements, in part, to prove duty based on their knowledge of dangerous conditions for employees based on ballast complaints from the railroad's yards at other locations, affirmed denial of the employer's summary judgment and directed verdict motions, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) with driving under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by alcohol, driving on a suspended license, failure to display a driver's license on demand, and exceeding the speed limit. The circuit court granted defendant's motion to dismiss driving under the influence of alcohol and driving while impaired by alcohol charges. The State of Maryland appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police suspected that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. After taking defendant into custody, the police read him the standardized advice of rights form. Defendant refused to consent to a breath test. Defendant claimed that the police failed to advise him of his alleged right, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-304(e) (1992), to have his own physician conduct a test on him for blood alcohol content. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the alcohol related charges for violating that right. On appeal, the court found that defendant never qualified for any right relating to additional testing pursuant to &sect; 10-304(e), as no test was performed. There was no failure to advise him of a non-existent right. Alternatively, even if defendant possessed a right to have an additional chemical test by a physician of his own choosing, there was no statutory obligation on the police to advise defendant of that right. Further, even if defendant possessed a right to have an additional chemical test by a physician of his own choosing, there was no constitutional obligation on the police to advise him of that right. Finally, the sanction was too severe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland). The circuit court dismissed the petition. The inmate then filed a motion to alter or amend, pursuant to Md. R. 2-534, the earlier dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The circuit court denied the motion. The inmate appealed. Appellee warden moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Exactly 10 days after the trial court dismissed the inmate's petition for writ of habeas corpus, the inmate filed his motion to alter or amend the trial court's judgment. The warden moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was in actuality an impermissible appeal from the dismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus. The court found that the motion was a proper 10-day motion under Md. R. 2-534 and it caused the judgment to lose its finality. The judgment became final due to the entry of the order denying the motion to alter or amend. The inmate's notice of appeal was necessarily from the judgment dismissing the petition for writ of habeas corpus. Further, it was apparent from the issues that the inmate attempted to raise on appeal that the inmate's challenge was to the dismissal of the petition. None of the exceptions that would permit an appeal from the dismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus were applicable. The arguments went directly to the legality of the inmate's convictions. Accordingly, the inmate was not permitted to appeal from the judgment dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a mother and next friend of her son, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which dismissed the mother's medical malpractice case against appellees, a county and a doctor, to recover for injuries sustained by the son at the time of his birth. The mother filed suit pursuant to the Local Government Tort Claims Act (LGTCA), Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-301 et seq. (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the child was born in 1991, the mother did not file the notice of claim as required by Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-304 until April 2001. Appellees moved to dismiss the suit, and the trial court dismissed it, finding the mother lacked good cause in filing a belated notice of claim. The mother contended on appeal that the trial court erred in finding she had not shown good cause for waiving the requirement of timely notice under &sect; 5-304(c), because prior to consulting with her current attorney, she had no knowledge that the doctor was employed by the county when her son was delivered. The court held that even if the mother lacked actual knowledge that the clinic in which the child was delivered was a county facility, she had an affirmative duty to inquire as to the doctor's legal identity and employment status. The court noted that no impediment, other than the mother's inaction, shielded the doctor's legal identity. The court upheld the constitutionality of the notice requirement of &sect; 5-304(a) as a reasonable restriction. The court discerned no constitutional violation created by the effect of the notice requirement on a minor whose claim arose under the LGTCA.</SPAN></P>

Proc. &sect; 11-304 (2002) was unconstitutional and whether the trial court's admission under that statute of a social worker's hearsay statements to replace the testimony of children defendant allegedly abused violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Md. Const. art. 21. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court found that the introduction of testimonial hearsay by available witnesses who did not testify violated the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. Amend. VI and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The social worker admitted that the children's statements she would testify to were taken in preparation for testimony, so the children would have to be unavailable for the testimony to be admissible. The conviction was reversed and a new trial ordered. However, since the conviction was reversed on evidentiary error grounds and there was sufficient evidence for the convictions, the new trial could not be avoided on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's mother died from cancer after the father and she were divorced. Prior to the mother becoming physically incapacitated, she had primary residential custody of the children. The mother expressed, both prior to her death and through he last will and testament, a desire for the children to maintain a relationship with her family and to be raised with an understanding and the benefit of both their father's Jewish culture and her Japanese heritage. On appeal, the father argued that the trial court erred by ordering visitation over his objections, in derogation of his due process rights. The appellate court found no error as, inter alia, the trial court considered and applied the relevant factors and fashioned a visitation schedule that served the best interests of the children. The father also argued that the trial court erred in failing to apply a presumption in favor of his decision to limit the grandmother's visitation with the children. While the appellate court noted that there was such a presumption, the presumption was rebuttable and the best interests of the children superseded all other considerations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) that convicted him, after his second trial, of second-degree murder and a weapons offense. He argued speedy trial violations, that his motions for mistrial and suppression of evidence should have been granted, that a video of his testimony at the first trial should not have been played, and that his sentence had been illegally enhanced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first conviction in the murder of his mistress was reversed because his wife had unexpectedly disclosed admissions that should have been privileged. There was a 19-month gap between the reversal and the commencement of the second trial, but the appeals court held that although the delay was of constitutional dimensions, since the State's conduct had not been egregious and defendant had not suffered actual prejudice, there was no constitutional violation. Although it was unfortunate that witnesses occasionally mentioned the first trial, there was no reversible error in the absence of disclosure of a prior conviction. Police officers from the city could execute their search warrant at defendant's home outside the city because they were accompanied by federal marshals. Despite defendant's decision not to testify at the second trial, it was permissible to play the video of his testimony from the first trial. Finally, although the actual time to be served was shorter, the sentence imposed after the second conviction on the weapons offense was an illegal, unsupported upward modification because it ran consecutively instead of concurrently to the murder sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, but vacated the sentence for the weapons conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an insured was badly injured, his insurer paid the medical bills. The policy contained a subrogation clause, and when the insureds' attorney negotiated a settlement with the tortfeasor, the insurer recovered its medical expenditures, subject to adjustments negotiated by the attorney. Nine years later, Maryland's Riemer case found such subrogation clauses unconstitutional, and later legislation permitting such clauses did not apply retroactively. The insureds argued that under these circumstances, they were entitled to repayment of the subrogated amount, but the appellate court agreed that their action was barred by the three-year limitations period of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101 (1998). The insureds knew all the facts about the subrogation when they entered the agreement; the only thing they did not know was the legal effect, and this did not toll the running of the statute, especially in the absence of any showing of wrongful concealment on the part of the insurer. Once the insureds' claim was dismissed, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to exercise ancillary jurisdiction over the insurer's third-party claim against their attorney.</SPAN></P>

The State did not present any evidence of the existence of a standard inventory search policy. The officer testified that he performed an inventory, and made out an inventory slip. That evidence did not tend to prove the existence of an inventory search policy, that the officer was acting pursuant to such a policy, and the pertinent contents of any such policy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun and obliterating a manufacturer's identification mark on a handgun. Defendant appealed. His contentions on appeal included that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of necessity and by not explaining that a rebuttable presumption did not shift the burden of persuasion to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the jury on the defense of duress, but did not instruct separately on the defense of necessity. The appellate court found that the trial court gave an appropriate instruction. The instruction was sufficiently broad that, if the jury believed defendant, it could have found him not guilty of possessing a handgun. Therefore, there was no error in the failure to give a separate necessity instruction that defendant sought. However, there was error in the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that a presumption was rebuttable and did not shift the burden of persuasion to defendant. The prosecutor, in closing argument, told the jury that under Maryland law, a person in possession of a handgun with an obliterated serial number was presumed to be the person who obliterated the serial number. The trial court subsequently instructed the jury on the presumption and refused defense counsel's request for an explanation of what &quot;rebuttable&quot; meant. The presumption did not pass constitutional muster because reasonable jurors might have concluded that they were obligated to infer that defendant obliterated the serial number unless he proved otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for wearing, carrying, or transporting a weapon was affirmed. The conviction for obliterating an identification mark on a firearm was vacated, and the case was remanded for a new trial on that charge only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant night club owner sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) that affirmed a decision of the local board of municipal and zoning appeals in favor of appellee officials' zoning enforcement action against the night club that limited adult entertainment to two nights a week, and from the court's sua sponte order that the night club obtain an adult entertainment license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the nightclub owner acquired the premises, two decades earlier, they were already being used for adult entertainment. The owner presented such shows only two nights a week, presenting other entertainment at other times. When the zoning administrator cited the owner for violating zoning laws, the owner argued that he was simply continuing a long-time nonconforming use, and was simply seeking to intensify it by presenting more adult shows. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that under Baltimore, Md., City Zoning Code &sect; 13-406 (2000), nonconforming uses of the type in question could not be expanded, and such expansion included increased hours of business. The appellate court also held, however, that because the zoning board had not ordered the owner to get an adult entertainment license (and it was not the agency that handled such licenses, anyway), the trial court exceeded its powers when it ordered the owner, sua sponte, to obtain such a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to the temporal limitation on adult uses, but vacated the portion of the judgment that ordered the night club owner to obtain a license.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the assessment, and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The use tax was imposed on the taxpayer's &quot;demonstration inventory,&quot; which, on occasion, was sold to customers. The appellate court held, under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 11-101(l)(3)(ii) (1997), &quot;use,&quot; for tax purposes did not include the exercise of a right or power over tangible personal property if the property's owner intended to resell it in the same form. Substantial evidence supported the Maryland Tax Court's finding that the demonstration inventory was being used in a manner that did not bring it within the exclusion from a use tax because over 75 percent of the equipment was in that inventory for over a year. Much of the equipment was used for training, displays, demonstrations at trade shows, and loaned to educational institutions, in part to increase the taxpayer's market share by promoting its products. Although some demonstration models were sold to customers, the equipment was used primarily to show it could be adapted to a particular customer's needs as opposed to effecting a sale of the item being demonstrated. The question was not one of law, and a deferential standard of review was applicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parolee appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Somerset County (Maryland) that denied his complaint for a declaratory judgment; the parolee claimed that appellee Central Collections Unit for the State of Maryland (CCU) had to cease and desist its attempts to collect restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a guilty plea, the parolee was ordered to pay restitution. When the parolee violated his parole, the balance of his restitution obligation was referred to the CCU for collection pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-616 (2001). The appellate court held that the reference was not a violation of the forfeiture prohibitions in Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 27. Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 637, enforcement of the order did not enhance the parolee's sentence. Since restitution was part of the parolee's original sentence and not merely a condition of parole, the restitution obligation was not wiped out by the parole revocation. Finally, because restitution payments were not the equivalent of any of the enumerated exceptions found in Md. Code Ann., State. Fin. &amp; Proc. &sect; 3-302(b), the division was authorized to refer the outstanding balance of restitution to the CCU.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Maryland State Board of Pharmacy challenged a judgment of the Baltimore City Circuit Court (Maryland) that reversed the Board's determination that appellee pharmacist had practiced pharmacy while her license was expired and failed to keep proper records of continuing education credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence in the administrative record indicated that the pharmacist had failed to timely renew her license. A few weeks late, she submitted her application and evidence of continuing education, and the Board renewed her license, but it nonetheless instituted a professional disciplinary licensing proceeding. The appellate court held, first, that the fact that the Board renewed the license did not preclude it from bringing the disciplinary proceeding. It then announced that it would not reach the issue of whether the Board's decision was based on substantial evidence, one of the bases on which the trial court had reversed the Board's decision; there were no findings fit for review because the pharmacist had not received the due process guaranteed to her by Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-201 (1999) and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. Board members, instead of behaving with the care and propriety of judges, had reviewed evidence before the hearing opened, and one member had called the pharmacist's counsel a &quot;bare-faced liar.&quot; Once the pharmacist had received a fair hearing, the Board's findings could be reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the Board's proceeding had denied the pharmacist due process, but reversed its determination that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. It therefore remanded the matter, directing the trial court to remand the matter to the Board, with directions to grant the pharmacist a fair hearing before an unbiased tribunal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the course of three different appeals of findings and recommendations of the Commission's administrative law judge (ALJ), the Commission repeatedly found that the employer discriminated against the employee, even though the ALJ repeatedly found that the employee was fired for other, non-pretextual reasons. The appellate court held that, on review, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-222, the trial court should only have looked to whether the administrative decision was supported by substantial evidence. Reviewing that same decision according to the substantial evidence standard, the appellate court held that the ALJ failed to make sufficient factual findings to enable the Commission to make its own informed decision, as many of the findings that the ALJ should have made involved credibility determinations that the Commission could not make on a cold record. Nonetheless, instead of remanding the matter to the ALJ for further fact finding regarding alleged preferential treatment of a white employee and harsh treatment of African American employees, the Commission made its own findings, unsupported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Harford County Circuit Court (Maryland) that convicted him of driving under the influence in violation of former Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 21-902(b) (1999). He argued that the fact of his refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test should not have been admissible in evidence, and that the jury should have been instructed to draw no inference of guilt therefrom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's arrest on drunk driving charges, the legislature amended the drunk driving statute to lower the permissible percentage of blood alcohol, and it also amended another statute to explicitly provide, at Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-309(a) (2001), that an accused's refusal to take a breathalyzer test could be admitted in evidence. The appellate court held that since the amendment simply expanded the universe of admissible evidence, it could be applied retroactively at defendant's trial, and since it did not create new substantive law or criminalize behavior that had been legal, it did not violate federal or Maryland prohibitions against ex post facto laws. Interpreting Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 22 similarly to federal constitutional law interpreting the Fifth Amendment, the appellate court also found the amended statute did not violate defendant's guarantee against self-incrimination. Since the refusal was admissible, it was not error to deny defendant's request for a jury instruction regarding the drawing of negative inferences.</SPAN></P>

The motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was stopped for a traffic violation because a license plate was torn off his car. The officer asked the motorist if the officer could search his car. The motorist did not consent to the search. The officer summoned a canine unit to the scene. A dog did not alert to the presence of drugs. The officer issued two warning citations to the motorist. The motorist contended that his constitutional rights were violated by the officer's conduct. On appeal, the court found that the circuit court erred in concluding that there was no evidence of an unjustified detention, but that the grant of summary judgment was nonetheless proper because, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-522(b) (1974, 2002), the officer could assert a qualified immunity defense against both the motorist's constitutional tort claims and his intentional tort claims, and the motorist did not present sufficient evidence of malice to defeat summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland), which reversed the county board of appeals' decision allowing the owner's waiver petition that had been made by the owner to permit disturbance of a stream and buffer area, and which ruled in favor of appellee county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed a petition seeking a waiver of the county zoning regulations so that it could subdivide its property and construct homes thereon. The request was initially denied, then granted on administrative appeal to the board, reversed at the trial level, and the owner sought further review. The court initially reviewed whether the county had the right to seek an appeal, and determined that it had standing and, by acting for the Maryland Division of Planning and Zoning, was considered a party. It concluded that it was aggrieved by the board's decision, and as such had the right to seek judicial review under Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 5(A) (2001). However, the court held that the board's decision could not be sustained because it was based on inadequate findings and conclusions, which were required to be set out pursuant to &sect; 5(U). Accordingly, remand was required to the trial court and then to the board for such findings. The court also noted that intervention by adjoining and nearby landowners was proper where the necessary criteria of Md. R. 2-214(a)(ii) had been shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment that found that the trial court had authority to review the issue on appeal, reversed that part of the board's determination that granted the waiver petition, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that its property was &quot;directly accessible&quot; to a certain arterial road as required for COS status by Harford County, Md., Zoning Code &sect; 267-46B(4)(b). The owner's experts opined that a county road would provide direct access between minor residential roads and collectors, thus fulfilling the &quot;direct access&quot; requirement of &sect; 267-46B(4)(b). The Board ruled that the county road was a &quot;local road,&quot; and that proper land use planning required limiting the flow of traffic from higher density projects through a lower density subdivision. The Board found that the project was not &quot;directly accessible&quot; to the arterial, and thus was not eligible for COS status. The instant court, construing the phrase &quot;direct access,&quot; held that &quot;directly&quot; qualified &quot;accessible&quot; to some extent and supported the Board's interpretation. The phrase &quot;directly accessible&quot; in &sect; 267-46B(4)(b) required that the property be proximate, immediate, front on, or abut a qualifying arterial road. The owner's project was not &quot;directly accessible&quot; from the arterial road as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of first-degree felony murder and of the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Defendant's appeal was based on (1) denial of his pretrial motion to suppress, (2) failure to exclude his admission, and (3) admission of an alleged confidential spousal communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence was that (1) defendant and three colleagues, to rob someone, stopped their car by a highway and raised the car hood; (2) a &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; victim stopped to help them; and (3) a colleague killed the victim with defendant's shotgun. The police were later informed by a person of the details of another murder which that person had witnessed; he said that defendant told him he had killed people in the other murder. The appeals court, in affirming, determined that the search warrant investigating the other murder was based upon probable cause under the applicable &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test (replacing the abandoned two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli analysis for testing hearsay information in warrant applications) and under the good-faith exception to warrant executions. The shotgun (used in all the murders) found at defendant's residence was properly not suppressed. The officer's testifying at a suppression hearing that he told defendant at the custodial interrogation that his wife had implicated him (to get him to talk) was not testimony to prove the truth of the wife's statement and was not hearsay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not invoke or prove the privilege against testimony disclosing confidential communication during marriage. Defendant's voluntary custodial admission before the required Miranda warning was properly not admitted, and his voluntary admission, after the warning and his voluntary waiver of Miranda rights, was not tainted by the earlier Miranda violation and was properly admitted. The appeals court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was originally sentenced to 50 years in prison after his murder conviction, but the sentencing judge corrected that sentence to life in prison with all but 50 years suspended. Years later, an announcement by the governor that he would not approve parole for murderers allegedly resulted in more oppressive conditions for petitioner. He challenged both these circumstances in a habeas corpus petition. The appellate court held that habeas corpus was the proper avenue by which to seek relief for a claimed illegality of sentencing, but held that petitioner's sentence was not illegal. Although pursuant to Md. R. 4-345(d) his original sentence, which was lower than the minimum sentence for murder, should have been corrected only after notice and a hearing, petitioner was not prejudiced because under the circumstances he received the shortest legal sentence he could have received. Since the parole commission considered petitioner for parole on a regular basis and was not bound by the governor's pronouncements, and since other matters such as work release and family leave were within the discretion of the corrections department, petitioner was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state classified employees filed grievances with appellee Maryland Military Department, challenging the requirement that they maintain membership in the Maryland National Guard (MNG) as a condition of employment. An administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled that the requirement was a classification standard exempt from the grievance process. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) affirmed the ALJ. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were all in one of the military airport firefighter classifications. Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect;&sect; 4-201 to 4-205, the Maryland Department of Budget and Management (DBM) established categories of employment positions and standards and procedures for classifying positions. In testimony which the ALJ found credible, the Maryland Military Department's personnel officer explained that the MNG requirement was one aspect of the standards for determining who qualified for the classifications at issue. Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 12-101(b)(2)(v) (1997, 2001 Supp.), the definition of grievance under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 12-101(b)(1) expressly excluded a dispute about &quot;the establishment of classification standards.&quot; The appellate court agreed with the ALJ and the trial court that the dispute came within that exception. Since disputes about &quot;the establishment of classification standards&quot; were excluded from the grievance procedure, the employees could not use the grievance procedure to challenge DBM's exercise of its classification power, and the challenge to the MNG requirement was not a proper basis for a grievance.</SPAN></P>

After the parties' divorce was final, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, dismissed the suit.

The trial court dismissed both counts of the amended compliant, on the basis that the claims were barred by interspousal immunity. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count I of the amended complaint alleged that the wife filed false criminal charges that were either dismissed or on which the husband was acquitted. Count II was based on the wife's alleged subsequent filing of charges that the prosecutor later dismissed. The appellate court noted that Lusby provided an exception to the doctrine of interspousal immunity when the tort committed against the spousal victim was not only intentional but &quot;outrageous,&quot; as where the errant spouse's conduct transcended common decency and accepted practices. For purposes of review, the appellate court accepted as true the husband's allegations that he was arrested and incarcerated five times and acknowledged that he suffered humiliation and hardship. However, the wife's conduct was not so extreme as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Thus, Count I was properly dismissed. But the trial court erred in dismissing Count 2 on grounds of interspousal immunity, as the wife failed to show that the parties were married when the cause of action arose (i.e., at the time the unfounded charges were dismissed).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing Count I of the second amended complaint was affirmed. The order dismissing Count II was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the driver of a car. The police found a gun in the trunk of the car, underneath the jacket of one of the two passengers in the car. The trial court, in convicting defendant, ruled that, as the driver and occupant of the car, defendant knew of the gun's presence, and was at least in constructive possession of it. The appellate court held that one's status as a driver-owner was sufficient to permit an inference that the driver-owner had knowledge of contraband in the vehicle. However, if there was a greater nexus between a passenger and the contraband than between the driver-owner and the contraband, then the driver-owner should not have been convicted of possession based solely on the driver-owner inference. This greater nexus limitation was not a bright line test, but merely a method of analyzing the sufficiency of evidence used to establish the knowledge necessary to convict in cases in which the State's case rested solely on a driver-owner inference. The location of the gun in this case suggested that, either the passenger placed the gun there, and then put his coat on top, or that the gun fell out of the passenger's coat after both were placed in the trunk.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court held that the trial court that initially reviewed an agency decision to deny compensation to the victim had properly found that an absence of substantial evidence in the record made it impossible to determine whether the victim's own conduct, purportedly as a drug dealer, precluded an award pursuant to former Md.

The appellate court further held that in the event of a prima facie showing raising the issue of whether the victim's criminal conduct contributed to his shooting, the agency was then obliged to provide the victim with a full and fair opportunity to persuade the agency to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

It did not have to expressly find each factor in Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Co. &sect; 7-513(e), when allowing the utility to recoup stranded costs, and its findings were adequate.  Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Co. &sect; 7-514(a), did not require it to conduct a market power adjudicatory proceeding, nor did it &quot;bargain away&quot; its future power to do so. Its approval of a six-year rate reduction did not violate Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Co. &sect; 7-505(d). Sufficient evidence supported its allocation of a percentage of the rate reduction to the utility's generation assets. It had jurisdiction, after the association's appeal, to let the utility transfer assets, as that matter was not fully considered in the order appealed, and it did not prejudice the association's rights. The commission did not have to review the transfer, under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Co. &sect; 7-508(c)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal the trial court erred in admitting his statement to police, and the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The appellate court noted that although the officer did not personally witness defendant driving an automobile, the officer received abundant information from eyewitnesses who did observe defendant driving and acting in a manner attributable to his intoxication. Accordingly, the appellate court found the officer possessed a reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that defendant had violated the drunk driving statute at the time he approached defendant. Further, the appellate court concluded defendant was not in custody within the contemplation of Miranda at the time he was questioned; thus, the appellate court found there was no need to give Miranda warnings. In addition, the appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction, even without the testimony by the officer. The appellate court reasoned that the testimony by the witnesses who observed defendant's driving and his conduct after exiting the vehicle, along with defendant's own admission, constituted sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant robbed a convenience store, the clerk victims were so frightened they could not open the cash register; defendant had put away his gun by the time he departed, taking only a package of cigarettes. The appeals court upheld his conviction on two counts of armed robbery, although only one sentence was appropriate under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c) (1957, 1996), because placing each victim in fear of deadly force was a separate robbery. Under the totality of the circumstances, the State established that defendant's statements to police were voluntary, since the suppression court reasonably found the police witnesses more credible as to defendant's state at the time of questioning and the absence of any coercion on their part. Defendant's prior convictions of armed robbery could be used to impeach him, although he had failed to preserve that issue in any case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, but vacated one of the two concurrent sentences for armed robbery to comply with applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a billboard company, appealed the rulings of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) granting summary judgment to appellee, a county, holding that the application of the county's zoning ordinances directed at billboards enacted in 1968, 1986, 1992, and 1997 did not constitute a taking. Alternatively, the billboard company contested the compensation deemed appropriate if the circuit court were reversed on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the county had no authority to ban pre-existing lawfully erected billboards without compensation for the billboards. The zoning ordinances did not trump Md. Ann. Code art. 25, &sect; 122E (1999). Since Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 8-737 (2001) also required payment for the banned billboards, an interpretation of that statute was moot.  Md. Ann. Code art. 25, &sect; 122E also required the payment of the fair market value of the leasehold interests where the billboards were located. The trial court should have ruled on the constitutionality of the prior ordinances. The ordinance enacted by the county could not be said, as a matter of law, either on its face or as applied, to alleviate the billboard problem to a material degree. The billboard company was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the matter. The trial court was directed to file a written opinion declaring the rights of the parties as to whether the ordinance prohibits future speech based on past speech. Finally, the trial court properly granted the county injunctive relief on its own initiative, with the exception of Count XXI. The issue of the constitutionality of the 1997 ordinance remained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment as to count XXI was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing as to count XXI and, if appropriate, the value of the billboard company's leasehold interests. The court wad to consider the constitutionality of the 1968, 1986, and 1992 ordinances, and if any, the extent of damages suffered by the billboard company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased state employee who had been convicted of drunk driving. Appellant employer, a state agency, terminated the employee's employment. The employee appealed, and an administrative law judge ordered him reinstated, which was affirmed by judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland). The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal dealt with the relationship between an executive order, which imposed a progressive scheme of disciplinary action and appeared to prohibit termination for a first drunk driving offense, and an administrative regulation that mandated automatic termination for such an offense. In upholding the lower court's decision, the higher appellate court found that the applicable administrative regulation applied to all state employees covered by the Maryland State Personnel Management System, while the executive order promulgated a disciplinary policy that applied only to state employees of the executive branch, which included the employee. Where two enactments covered the same subject, the specific enactment applied over the general enactment. As such, the specific enactment, applicable to the employee, was the executive order. Since it did not allow for termination of an employee for a first off-the-workplace drunk driving offense, the employee's termination was properly set aside, and the employee was ordered reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teen-ager participated with others in a carjacking and several armed robberies. Although he was present at sexual assault crimes against one carjacking victim, he was not convicted of either charge, but the initial charges were sufficient to permit his trial on those charges, and those arising out of them, as an adult pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-804(e) (1998). The appeals court determined that all the crimes against the carjacking victims arose out of the same incident as the sexual assault, so the circuit court had jurisdiction, but two convenience store robberies that occurred later the same evening were not so related, so they would have to be retried, if at all, in a juvenile court. The appeals court also briefly held that defendant's confession was voluntary, that he was not entitled to severance of offenses, and that his sentences were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction as to those offenses closely related in time and causation to the most serious charges, but reversed his convictions on charges arising out of armed robberies less closely related to the first series of offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of second degree assault, intentionally and knowingly obstructing and hindering a police officer in the lawful performance of his duties, willfully failing to obey the reasonable and lawful order of a law enforcement officer, and resisting arrest. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer announced he was arresting two juveniles for alcohol possession. The arrest was in violation of Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 402, which authorized only a citation. The events were described in detail. The special appeals court then found that elements of the crimes could not be found beyond a reasonable doubt, after viewing the facts favorable to the prevailing party, the State. The pivotal obstruction issue was whether the officer was acting in good faith under an objective reasonably well-trained officer standard, but defendant was not allowed to present certain evidence of the officer's motivations and the unlawfulness of the arrest. The special appeals court gave special instructions to be followed on retrial. A person was allowed to use reasonable force to prevent his own or another's unlawful arrest, which was not being made in good faith. The obstruction reversal here required determination that the assault, the force (pushing) used to repel the officer's illegal actions, was reasonable. The assault instructions were erroneous. Defendant obeyed by stepping away, so defendant was acquitted of that charge. Defendant could reasonably resist his unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special appeals court reversed the failure to obey conviction, vacated the other convictions, and remanded the case for further proceedings, including retrial, consistent with the special appeals court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The county contended that the compensation received was not a tax, and that the agreements were valid, binding agreements. The appeals court noted that the label used was not a fee or a tax. Rather, the label was compensation in exchange for a waiver under Arundel County, Md., Code art. 26. The county did not collect a fee applicable to an activity that the developer had the right to pursue. The parties entered into a contract pursuant to which the county waived the bar represented by the adequate public facilities (APF) ordinance in exchange for compensation to be used to make the facilities adequate in the area in question. The court held that the parties were free to so contract. The appeals court held that the waiver agreements were valid contracts, rather than devices to exact taxes, and consequently, the court did not reach the question of the county's power to impose an excise tax.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the appellate court held that the trial court committed reversible error by: (1) omitting from the jury instructions the necessary standard for a wrongful death action arising out of medical malpractice; (2) admitting at trial the treating physician's deposition testimony even though the technical requirements of Md. R. 2-419 had not been fulfilled; and (3) allowing the issue of damages for conscious pain and suffering to go to the jury even though the evidentiary requirements of Ory had not been fulfilled. However, the trial court properly applied the cap on non-economic damages set forth in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108 (1995 &amp; Supp. 1998) because &sect; 11-108 applied to any action for damages for personal injury. Therefore, it was a general law and did not violate the constitutional prohibition in Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant did not argue that the State failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that he murdered the child. Instead, he argued that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to dismiss his indictment, failing to strike jurors for cause, failing to suppress items of evidence that were (allegedly) illegally obtained, improperly admitting evidence against him, and improperly restricting his trial counsel's cross-examination of certain key witnesses. The appellate court held, first, that the failure to dismiss the indictment was not reversible error, because the exculpatory evidence withheld from the grand jury by the State would not have negated defendant's guilt. Second, even if disqualification for cause was improperly denied, there was no reversible error because defendant's trial counsel did not exercise all allowable peremptory challenges. Finally, a break in custody was an exception to the Edwards rule, and the five-plus years defendant spent in prison after invoking his right to counsel constituted a break in custody. Thus, the trial court did not violate the Edwards rule in denying defendant's motion to suppress his statements to police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) entered a judgment convicting defendant of two counts of robbery and one count of second degree assault, and sentencing him to two, consecutive, 10-year prison terms for his robbery convictions, with 10 years to be served without parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the State failed to prove at the suppression hearing that his detention was constitutional; (2) his trial counsel was denied an opportunity to present arguments on the suppression motion; (3) it was improper for the State to tell the jury in closing argument that certain counts would not have been included in the indictment unless they were valid; and (4) the State failed to prove the prerequisites for the enhanced penalty for violent offenders under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(d) (1996 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2000). The appellate court held, first, that the trial court erred in failing to rule on the issue of the propriety of the initial stop and arrest of defendant, because defendant clearly stated that he was challenging the stop and everything that flowed from it. Second, because the State never presented any legal theory concerning the initial stop, the trial court on remand could hear additional evidence concerning that issue. Third, the State's comments in closing argument could not have misled or prejudicially influenced the jury. Finally, the trial court was entitled to rely on the presentence investigation report to invoke &sect; 643B(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court, without affirmance or reversal, for the purpose of conducting a suppression hearing to determine whether the initial stop and arrest of defendant was authorized by the Fourth Amendment.

A jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, convicted defendant of possession of a controlled dangerous substance; possession of drug paraphernalia; and of violating a city loitering ordinance, Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 19, &sect; 25-1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After seeing defendant and others standing on a sidewalk impeding pedestrian traffic, a police officer told them they were loitering and would be arrested if they did not move on. The officer arrested defendant after returning later and seeing him in the same location still impeding traffic. Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence found during the search should have been suppressed as there was no probable cause for his arrest; the loitering evidence was insufficient; and the prosecutor was erroneously allowed to withdraw her nolle prosequi of the cocaine charge. The appellate court held that the circuit court erred in allowing the prosecutor to withdraw her nolle prosequi on the grounds that the nolle prosequi was conditional. There was nothing conditional about the nolle prosequi and defendant should not have been tried on a charge that no longer existed. The arrest was illegal, the related search was unconstitutional, and the evidence to convict defendant of loitering was insufficient because defendant was not warned before his arrest that he was violating the law by impeding traffic. Under these circumstances, all the convictions had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The BCPD contended that an order granting its first motion to dismiss controlled, given that the order was docketed after an order denying its second motion to dismiss, and that the court erred in denying its second motion to dismiss.

The BCPD next argued that the circuit court failed to properly apply the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, and alternatively that it should have been dismissed from the case because it had no existence as a legal entity capable of being sued. State sovereign immunity protected the BCPD against all the claims asserted against it: the ordinary tort claims (direct and respondeat superior liability), and the respondeat superior state constitutional tort claims. The circuit court erred in denying the motion to dismiss. Public official immunity protected the commissioner from liability arising out of actions or omissions pertaining to hiring, training, and supervising.

The appellate court found that because a second judge was not bound by an earlier judge's ruling in the same case, the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in reviewing, de novo, the second motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiff later attacked the validity of his release, when he discovered that child abuse registration and police internal affairs documents had not been expunged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) which convicted defendant of second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress and in imposing a ten-year term of probation. The appellate court concluded the failure by the trial judge to determine whether the warrant was validly signed by an issuing judge constituted error. In addition, the appellate court noted that whether the date of the issuance had been proven should have been decided by the trial judge, as the finder of fact on such matters during a suppression hearing. Therefore, the appellate court remanded the case for a limited suppression hearing for determinations whether a date for the issuance of the warrant was ascertainable and whether the warrant was signed by a judge. However, review of the record established that there was a substantial basis for the issuing judge's determination of probable cause. In addition, the appellate court remanded the case in order for the trial court to clarify the term of probation to be served by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the judgments and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was charged with possession with the intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance and he moved to suppress cocaine that was seized by police when they executed a no-knock search warrant and searched his home. The Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) denied the defendant's motion and a jury convicted the defendant of the charge. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police in Harford County (Maryland) executed a search warrant that was granted by a Baltimore County (Maryland) judge. The warrant was granted after the defendant sold cocaine to an informant and it allowed police to search the defendant's home in Harford County. The warrant did not authorize or prohibit a no-knock entry and police entered the house without knocking because the task force leader had been told by an assistant State's attorney that there was no requirement to knock and announce police presence when police believed that doing so would lead to destruction of evidence. The appellate court noted the absence of a provision in Maryland law which allowed Maryland courts to issue no-knock warrants, and held that although police in Maryland may execute a search warrant without first knocking and announcing, there is a presumption that favors knocking and announcing and a no-knock entry is lawful only in cases where the police can articulate a reasonable suspicion, based on particularized facts, that exigent circumstances exist which justify not knocking and announcing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County filed a petition for constructive civil contempt to enforce an injunction previously entered against adult bookstore. Adult bookstore claimed it had changed its inventory in compliance with the injunction. The trial court refused to find contempt, and county appealed. The appellate court reviewed common law and legislative history, and held that generally there was no right of appeal to a party who unsuccessfully sought to have another held in contempt. However, based on the limited facts of the case, the appellate court allowed the appeal because it was intertwined with a separate appealable order, the injunction. The trial court used a criminal standard of proof rather than a civil one. The appellate court refused to go beyond its limited holding. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence or applying the zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county enacted an ordinance which restricted the location of adult bookstores to certain areas. In particular, the store could not be located within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, school, library, park, playground, recreational facility or church. As a result of the ordinance, appellant would have to move its bookstore. The appellate court held the ordinance was not content-based and thus used an intermediate scrutiny analysis. It held there was a legitimate governmental interest for restricting the store's location and the legislators' motivations were irrelevant. It held even if it accepted appellant's contention of there being only 4 to 12 appropriate sites available for appellant's store, because there were only two stores affected, there were sufficient alternative sites as well as methods of communication. Thus, there was no substantial impairment of public access or availability of materials. Finally, the appellate court held there was no prior restraint.</SPAN></P>

The officers arrested defendant, and found that he possessed $ 260 in small bills. Defendant offered testimony by a person who said she was with defendant, and did not see him pick up the bag. The appellate court held that (1) the evidence was sufficient to fairly convince a jury that defendant committed both offenses charged; (2) defendant was properly sentenced under Md. Ann.

Appellant challenged application of his disability benefits to payment of bill for institutional care. Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) affirmed appellee agency's decision that appellant was primarily liable for his care, and appellee did not violate state or federal law in applying appellant's benefits to his bill for current care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the trial court erred in concluding that appellee did not have a fiduciary duty to use the benefits in the best interest of appellant, and in failing to find a breach of that duty in appellee's failure to consider appellant's discharge needs. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in refusing to hold appellee's process of applying appellant's benefits to charges for services violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 407(a). The voluntary application of benefits by a representative payee to the cost of current maintenance was not a violation of &sect; 407(a). If a permitted payment was not voluntarily made by a representative payee, a creditor, including the state, was prohibited by &sect; 407(a) from enforcing its claim by legal process, including coercion, threats, and the like. There was substantial evidence to show that appellee was in compliance with state law. A representative payee had a duty to expend social security benefits in the best interest of the beneficiary and had discretion in fulfilling that duty. Under federal law, a representative payee had a duty to exercise discretion, but appellee did not exercise discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county appealed Howard County Circuit Court (Maryland) dismissal of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297(h)(6)(i) (1996 Repl. Vol., 1999 Supp.), forfeiture complaint for failure to try it within 60 days; defendant car owner appealed seizure from garage as violating U.S. Const. amend. IV and unsupported by probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county commenced a civil forfeiture proceeding, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297 (1996 Repl. Vol., 1999 Supp.), against defendant accused drug dealer's car. The court held that dismissal was not appropriate for failure to hold a hearing within the statutory period of 60 days. The statute did not provide for such a period to run, even as to setting a hearing date, until a defendant had responded to the complaint. In this case, defendant's other pleadings, including the dismissal motion, and errors by trial court administrative personnel, caused the untimeliness, and dismissal was an inordinate sanction. The court also held, in identifying those procedures required after remand, that since defendant presented evidence in support of his motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause, this converted his motion to one for summary judgment. Therefore, plaintiff was to be permitted to introduce its own evidence in response.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated dismissal because statute did not require that hearings actually be held within specified time, and dismissal was not warranted when delay was due to defendant's own delay and court personnel's mistakes. Furthermore, dismissal for lack of probable cause was improper without giving plaintiff opportunity to present evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the circuit court properly found appellant to be without standing. The court found that appellant did not live so close to the subject property that he was per se aggrieved, that appellant presented no evidence that appellee merchant's proposed structure would cause his property to devaluate, and that appellant's interests in the matter were no different than the interests of a member of the general public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hearing board found that appellant deputy had used excessive force. Appellee sheriff reviewed the board's recommendation and increased the penalty. The Circuit Court for St. Mary's County, Maryland upheld the findings of the board, but found that appellee failed to satisfy procedural requirements and remanded to appellee. Appellee reiterated his decision, the circuit court issued its final order, and appellant challenged that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was working in an approved part-time assignment at a restaurant when he was required to restrain a disruptive and intoxicated patron. In the course of restraining the patron, appellant used pepper spray. The patron subsequently filed a complaint for the use of excessive force. Based on an administrative hearing board's finding that appellant had used excessive force, appellee increased the board's recommended penalty to dismissal. The appellate court held that appellee's penalty enhancements were outside the boundaries of the law and could not stand because appellee failed to follow the required procedures of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 731(c), to increase the penalty. In addition, the board's finding that appellant used excessive force was not supported by the evidence because the board failed to apply the Graham standard for evaluating such claims. The board's finding that appellant made untruthful statements regarding the incident was not supported by substantial evidence because the report contained only inaccurate or improper information due to appellant's perceptions and was not intentionally deceitful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Final order reversed because (1) the proper standard for evaluating such claims showed that appellant did not use excessive force in restraining a disruptive restaurant patron; (2) appellee violated required procedures by increasing the board's recommended penalty to dismissal; and (3) appellant's statements about the incident were inaccurate and were not intentionally deceitful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, cigarette manufacturer and cigarette filter manufacturer, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) after a jury verdict which awarded appellee $ 2 million noneconomic and $ 225,000 economic damages for mesothelioma induced from asbestos in appellees' cigarette filters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee smoked cigarettes in the 1950's which were manufactured by an appellant with filters manufactured by another appellant. There was evidence appellee's condition was from work exposure to asbestos. The jury concluded appellee contracted mesothelioma from crocidolite asbestos in appellants' filters. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the action against appellant filter manufacturer for insufficient minimum contact for personal jurisdiction under the &quot;purposefully directed&quot; rather than the &quot;stream of commerce&quot; test of the long-arm statute. For appellant cigarette manufacturer, remand was made to the trial court to determine 1) when appellee's disease and not cell change started, to properly apply the noneconomic damage cap applicable to causes of action arising after July 1, 1986, and 2) to apply joint tortfeasor statute to appellee's settlement with a former party if it found that party to be a joint tortfeasor. The court affirmed the trial court instructions to not take into account exposure to nonparty asbestos, that appellants had a continuing duty to warn considering state-of-the-art knowledge of asbestos filter defects, and not to permit appellee's exhumation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to appellant filter manufacturer. The trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over that appellant under the long-arm statute since that appellant had insufficient minimum contact with Maryland. The court remanded for the trial court to find 1) when the disease started, to properly apply the noneconomic damages cap, and 2) to apply joint tortfeasor statute to appellee's settlement with a former party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999, defendant appellant was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder for the 1987 death of his infant son. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. On appeal, he claimed the trial judge erred in admitting expert testimony as to cause and manner of death, statistical evidence relative to infant death and expert opinions based on that evidence, prohibiting the defense expert from presenting a basis for his opinion, admitting evidence rebutting the findings of the infants' original death certificates, and admitting evidence of appellant's alleged murder of his infant daughter in 1980.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County (Maryland) judgment granting defendant a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel relevant to certain DNA evidence, specifically its admission without related population genetics statistics and failure to qualify defense expert on the subject.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree felony murder, first-degree rape, kidnapping, and use of a handgun committing a crime of violence. He was sentenced to life without parole plus 65 years. On direct appeal, his kidnapping conviction was reversed and the rape conviction was merged into felony murder. Defendant then petitioned for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel related solely to the trial's DNA evidence, and the circuit court granted a new trial. The court reversed, holding defendant failed to show either of the required elements of ineffectiveness, performance or prejudice, and had to show both. The evidence fell into five categories: three of them standing alone satisfied the State's burden, including hair and fiber evidence and a confession. One category was marginal, and one, DNA evidence, was peripheral. The ineffective assistance claims concerned only the peripheral category, weak DNA evidence showing defendant could not be excluded from the class of possible donors of a DNA specimen found on the victim's body. Counsel's trial tactics in this regard did not constitute ineffectiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the Circuit Court for Somerset County's (Maryland) dismissal, for failure to state a claim, of his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against appellees, parole commission and corrections commissioners, which alleged that appellees repeatedly refused to decrease his security classification or grant parole in retaliation for lawsuits, grievances, and administrative complaints he filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate received reclassification team recommendations that his security status be decreased, which were refused by appellees, parole commission and corrections commissioners. Appellant sued under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging U.S. Const. amend. I, V, VIII, and XIV, Ex Post Facto, Equal Protection, and Due Process violations, claiming that the refusals were retaliation for complaints of his and had denied him meaningful opportunity for parole. Appellant's case was dismissed for failure to state a claim, which the court affirmed. Appellant did not allege that as a result of appellees' retaliatory conduct he could not institute a lawsuit or grievance that he otherwise would have filed. Appellant's sentence remained the same as on the day it was imposed; therefore the refusals had not increased the measure of his punishment. The speculative possibility that Md. Div. of Correction Directive 100-005.II.P would delay his release on parole did not constitute an ex post facto violation. Appellant did not allege he was treated unlike other inmates. Warden discretion to approve a status change did not create a constitutionally protected interest. Depression was not cruel punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Appellant's suit, alleging &sect; 1983 and ex post facto violations for appellees' allegedly retaliatory refusals to decrease his security classification, which may have denied him parole opportunities, was dismissed for failure to state a claim. Appellant did not allege he was treated differently than other inmates, nor did his depression constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-client was convicted of fraud, and before sentencing hired appellees, lawyers, as new counsel. Appellant asked for revision of appellees' engagement letter that excluded appeal work, but he signed it anyway. Appellant was granted partially suspended sentence. Appellees withdrew from representation. Appellant violated his probation, received his full sentence, and sought post-conviction relief, which was initially granted. The State applied to appeal that grant and appellant sued appellees in circuit court for malpractice. Post-conviction relief was denied; appellant said he intended to petition for habeas corpus. Summary judgment was granted appellees, which the court vacated. Appellant had initiated post-conviction action, even though he had not obtained it; thus the circuit court should have considered staying appellant's malpractice action, granting him Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101 limitations relief pending his diligent effort to obtain habeas. The circuit court improperly made a fact/credibility finding that it was undisputed that appellant, who had claimed oral modification of his agreement with appellees, knew appellees would not note an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Child was the only child of appellant and her husband. Husband died in an automobile accident. Shortly after his death, appellee grandparents, parents of husband, sought visitation rights as to child. While appellant did not object to some visitation, she wanted appellees' visitation limited. Trial court denied appellant's motion for summary judgment on constitutional grounds and established a visitation schedule for appellees. The court reversed, finding Md. Code Ann. &sect; 9-102 was unconstitutional as applied to appellant. Appellees did not allege appellant was an unfit parent, which had to be shown before a court could interfere with parental rights. Appellant did not oppose visitation and conceded it was in child's best interest to have contact with appellees. The U.S. Supreme Court decision controlled the case even though the narrower Maryland statute allowed only grandparents to petition for visitation and appellant opposed the court-ordered visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee moved with her child to Tennessee, appellant, who had lived with appellee in Maryland in a same-sex relationship, sought custody of, or visitation with, the child.

The trial court granted appellee's motion and appellant sought appellate review. The appellate court reversed. The trial court correctly concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the case--the child had lived in Maryland until six months before the suit was filed--but erred in dismissing based upon forum non conveniens. Under Maryland law, appellant, as a non-biological parent claiming to be a de facto parent, had standing to show exceptional circumstances warranted awarding her custody. She also had standing to seek visitation. Under Tennessee law, appellant had no standing to seek either custody or visitation; therefore, Tennessee did not provide an available alternative forum for appellant to bring her claims.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court presumed that the trial court could and did distinguish the nuances of the law. Further, when imposing sentence, the court indicated it relied in part on the presentence investigation, which was appropriate. When determining whether defendant was a sexually violent predator, the court appropriately considered defendant's out-of-state conviction.

Appellant questioned whether: (1) legally sufficient evidence proved penetration for both convictions, (2) the court erred in refusing to compel DNA studies, (3) the court erred in denying a suppression motion of photographic evidence taken after a traffic warrant arrest, (4) probable cause supported the 1991 warrant for blood seizure, and (5) examination of blood seized under the 1991 case warrant violated U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. Testimony by the victim and examining nurse indicated penetration, and was legally sufficient. The DNA studies issue was not preserved for appeal. A valid basis to stop appellant was not unlawful because the police also obtained evidence of another crime, thereby precluding suppression. Defense counsel in the 1991 case failed to object to the probable cause ruling. No constitutional violation occurred since any privacy expectation in the blood disappeared when it was validly seized in 1991. The DNA signature was the same, regardless of the sample used. The appellate court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed since legally sufficient testimony proved penetration, valid basis to stop appellant was not unlawful because police also obtained evidence of another crime, defense counsel in earlier case did not object to probable cause ruling, no constitutional violation occurred since blood privacy expectation disappeared upon earlier valid seizure, and DNA signature was the same, regardless of sample used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was struck by a car driven by a state employee. The trial court awarded her limited damages. On appeal, appellant asserted that the Maryland Tort Claims Act, which limited tort awards against the State, was an unconstitutional restriction on the rights of injured persons to recover fair and adequate compensation for the negligent acts of state employees. Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 12-104(a). Appellant argued that the statute violated Md. Const. art. XIX by acting as an unreasonable restriction on the right to a remedy, and that the statute violated the equal protection guarantee in U.S. Const. art. XIX by limiting the amount of money recoverable against a State while not providing for a similar limitation as against private individuals. The court affirmed the judgment because the monetary limit was a waiver of sovereign immunity up to that level and therefore not a violation of the state constitution. Further, the statutory classification was not subject to any level of scrutiny higher than rational basis, under which the court found no denial of equal protection in the enactment or in the use of the monetary limitation.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the Superintendent's approval of an assistant's recommendation; it satisfied the duty to make a finding. Appellant had notice of his hearing before the Local Board and was represented by counsel at that hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a probationary status new employee social worker of defendant children psychiatric institution. Her job performance caused defendant to request her resignation. Plaintiff had diabetes and fainting spells. Plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter following an Equal Opportunity Employment Commission investigation, stating she was discharged solely because she suffered a disability. The court affirmed summary judgment to defendant in plaintiff's action under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 794. Plaintiff's job performance was below reasonable job expectations in several respects. Plaintiff disregarded instructions of her supervisor, spent time on tasks that were not hers, engaged clients in recreation that were inappropriate for them or in dangerous places, and fainted when driving. Defendant's demonstrated that they tried to improve plaintiff's skills and that diabetes was not a reason for discharge, rebutted only by plaintiff's unsubstantiated allegations.

On appeal, the issue was whether the trial court erred when it ruled that the child abuse victim's statements to a social worker and a psychologist were admissible.

Code art. 27, &sect; 775 provided that certain out-of-court statements made by child abuse victims were admissible in a criminal trial after a hearing had been held to determine the trustworthiness of the statement. Here, the trial court carefully followed the statutory requirements of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 775 because it conducted a full and proper hearing, made all the necessary rulings, and properly found the victim's statements were sufficiently reliable and trustworthy. Accordingly, there was full compliance with the confrontation clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>

The statute was not impermissibly overbroad because it neither infringed on appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I nor inhibited the exercise of those rights by others. The statute was not void for vagueness because the definition of hazing provided sufficient notice of the prohibited conduct and the statute did not authorize arbitrary enforcement. The statute did not restrict free speech on the basis of content because it was directed solely at unprotected pure conduct, whatever its motivation, rather than expressive conduct that was significantly imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of U.S. Const. amends.

Appellants' failure to file a report of their federal income adjustments within the appropriate time limit allowed appellee to make assessments any time. Neither the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) adjustment reports, nor appellants' correspondence to appellee satisfied the reporting requirements of &sect; 13-1101(c). Appellants' correspondence also was not filed within the prescribed time, failed to provide any basis for the claim that the federal adjustment was erroneous, and failed to inform appellee why the determination was incorrect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, while serving a previous sentence, was charged with stalking and harassment. The trial court found appellant guilty of harassment and acquitted him of stalking. Appellant claimed on appeal that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on the ground that the Maryland harassment statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 121A, was unconstitutional; and ( 2) the trial court erred in convicting him of harassment without sufficient evidence. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claims and affirmed his harassment conviction. The court held that (1) the harassment statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad; and (2) the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant for harassment. The court could think of few circumstances when a person's right to be free from the intrusion of frequent personalized mail deserved more protection than when the mail recipient was the victim of a prior kidnapping and stalking by the sender of the letters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction for harassment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant recorded his interactions with police and posted them on the internet. His alleged violations of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-402(a)(1) and (2) had to be dismissed because, (1) under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-401(2)(i), an oral communication was a private conversation, and (2) his interactions with the police were not private conversations, as they occurred on a public highway. His alleged possession of a device designed to surreptitiously intercept oral communications, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-403(a), had to be dismissed because (1) the State never gave him specifics about the alleged device, despite his request, (2) it could not rely on an assumption that he knew what he was alleged to have done, and (3) the charge gave no indication of why it thought he knew and had reason to know the design of the unnamed device made it primarily useful for surreptitious interception, as the charge merely repeated statutory language. The charge alleging recording illegal activity, under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 21-1126, had to be dismissed because it unconstitutionally criminalized a protected activity.</SPAN></P>

An analysis using the ACE-V methodology was inadmissible, under Md. R. 5-702, because (1) the State did not show there were any objective or universal standards governing the application of the technique establishing its reliability, (2) the degree of similarity required to individualize prints was left to individual examiners, and (3) the State's proof regarding the ACE-V methodology showed ACE-V was a subjective, untested, unverifiable identification procedure that purported to be infallible, as the testimony of the State's expert claiming there was no error rate for ACE-V was not credible. The fact that fingerprint evidence had historically been admitted did not require its admission because the reliability of such identifications had not been subjected to scientific testing, and, without impartial testing, whether or not the methodology was infallible was unknown.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-105, plus an amount equal to the lowest county income tax rate set by any Maryland county in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-106.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonresidents argued that imposing a special non-resident tax exclusively on non-residents, coupled with the differences in how the tax revenue was allocated, equated to discrimination against non-residents in violation of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights. The nonresidents asserted that the state income tax and the local income tax were different taxes and could not be combined to determine if residents and non-residents were being taxed equally. The tax court found that Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-106.1, served a rational purpose to create parity in the income tax burdens between residents and nonresidents. The tax court held that there was no extra tax burden that would deter a non-resident from free and open commerce inside or outside the state, and there was no extra tax burden that might be construed to violate the privileges and immunities and equal protection accorded to everyone. Accordingly, the tax court held that &sect; 10-106.1 did not violate the Interstate Commerce, Equal Protection, or Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the United States Constitution, or the Maryland Constitution and the Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporate taxpayer appealed respondent Maryland Comptroller of the Treasury's final determination assessing additional income tax for a past year on grounds that the taxpayer erred in including in its net operating losses accumulated deductions for dividends from foreign subsidiaries, challenging the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-307(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a multinational corporation, paid income taxes in Maryland, as elsewhere. To avoid double taxation of dividends, Maryland law permitted a corporation to deduct dividends received from a subsidiary from its taxable income. However, Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-307(d), as applied to recipients of dividends from foreign, as opposed to United States domestic, subsidiaries prevented the taxpayer from including these deductions in the net operating losses that it carried forward. The taxpayer challenged the state comptroller's disallowance of these deductions as violative of the foreign commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and equal protection, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court did not reach the equal protection argument, because it found that the provision violated the commerce clause, which was even more protective of foreign commerce than it was of interstate commerce, by impermissibly discriminating against corporations involved in foreign commerce.</SPAN></P>
