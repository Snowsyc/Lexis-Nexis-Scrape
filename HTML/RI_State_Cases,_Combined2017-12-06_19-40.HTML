However, &sect; 12-19-18(b) was unconstitutional as applied because it attempted to impose a rule of decision on a judgment of the court at a time subsequent to the entry of that judgment, and such an attempt encroached on the power of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tribe sought a declaration that the Casino Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-61.2-1 et seq., was violative of R.I. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and 15. Intervenor corporation filed a motion for summary judgment, the tribe, defendant State, and intervenor limited liability company (LLC) filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tribe argued that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and infirm because it contains substantive terms that were not defined. The tribe specifically challenged R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 42-61.2-1(8) and 42-61.2-2.1(c)(2), (3), (6), (7), and (10) as being constitutionally impaired. It also contended that the Act unconstitutionally delegated certain legislative powers to a private corporation without adequate legislative standards or specific statutory safeguards. However, the tribe failed to sustain its very heavy burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Act violated an identifiable aspect of the Rhode Island or United States Constitution. Neither the Act, nor the proposed referenda asking voters to approve facilities which would include state operated casino gaming, such as table games, contravened the mandate of R.I. Const. art. VI, &sect; 15. Furthermore, the presence of a necessary and proper clause in the Act did not obviate its constitutionality. Finally, the Act reposed full operational control in the State and granted the Lottery Division the authority to make all decisions about all aspects of the functioning of the business enterprise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the summary judgment to the corporation, the State and the LLC. It denied the tribe's cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-15, the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An auctioneer's client alleged that her apprentice sold the client's autographed boxing gloves at a price unreasonably under value. The auctioneer's license was suspended and she was fined by the Department of Business Regulation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-58-8. Upon review, the court held that there was no substantive due process violation. Concerns regarding vagueness of the licensing regulations lacked merit where they provided &quot;fair warning&quot; to auctioneers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer sought a stay of his suspension without pay, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-28.6-13(d), when his appeal of his indecent exposure/disorderly conduct conviction in district court caused the matter not to be disposed of within 180 days of his suspension pursuant to an investigation of the charges. Defendant town objected to his petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer said the delay was outside his control. He was not entitled to a stay because (1) the delay was due to his choice to appeal his conviction, and (2) comparing R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-28.6-13(d) with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-28.6-13(h) showed the general assembly intended to include appeals as a reason to convert a suspension with pay to one without pay as it did not specifically exclude it. This interpretation did not lead to an absurd result because, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-28.6-13(g), it did not make his penalty worse for choosing to appeal, since, had he chosen not to appeal, the town might not have simply reinstated him. The general assembly intended to use 180 days as a practical cutoff for salary and benefits, despite any appeals, because (1) appeals would far exceed 180 days, (2) making a town pay a suspended officer during this time led to an absurd result, and (3) the general assembly, not the judiciary, could limit statutory privileges. This interpretation did not deny his right to a jury, under R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, because the 180 day suspension with pay was a statutory privilege, so he merely lost a statutory protection that was not constitutionally guaranteed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was pulled over by a police officer, he was charged with refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere and the case was transferred to the superior court. However, no further notice was sent and no further contact was made with defendant for two and one-half years. The court found, inter alia, that because defendant's case was inexplicably delayed by more than 30 months, the delay was presumptively prejudicial. There was no indication that defendant had any part in the extraordinary delay. Accordingly, defendant's right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was violated. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did not extend to physical evidence, such as blood, hair, or breath samples. While defendant's arguments were persuasive, they did not persuade the court to find the refusal statute unconstitutional on its face. The question of the constitutionality of the &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; threshold for the stop was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix filed a motion in limine, a motion to compel discovery, and a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix moved to bar evidence she did not properly secure her child in a safety seat. The motion succeeded because R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-22-22(a)(2) and (h) barred such evidence. The statute did not offend procedural due process because defendants could try to reduce damages to the extent of the administratrix's comparable fault. It did not offend separation of powers by denying judicial discretion to find relevant evidence's admissibility because the evidence was deemed irrelevant. The administratrix could not amend her complaint, under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 15, to join the company's insurers because (1) she met no exceptions to the bar against such joinder in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-2-2, and, (2) under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-7-2.4, allowing such joinder when an alleged tortfeasor filed for bankruptcy, the company was available. The owner's motion to compel the company's discovery responses was denied because it did not show the company had documents it sought under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 34. The motion was granted as to requests served on a certain date because the company did not respond, after adequate time, waiving objections, under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 33.</SPAN></P>

If &sect; 12-19-19(c) applied retroactively, it violated separation of powers because it mandated trial courts to quash pleas previously accepted as knowing and voluntary admissions or implied admissions of guilt, reversing the courts' judgments and directing them to act upon their judgments only in a specified manner by absolving a defendant of all legal blame for a crime to which he or she admitted or impliedly admitted guilt, constituting an unconstitutional exercise of judicial power by the legislature, and ignoring the Rhode Island Supreme Court's express finding that defendants who received deferred sentences were not entitled to have their records sealed.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 45-9-1 et seq. (1956) and the propriety of appointments made to the city's housing authority (CFHA) and detention center corporation (DCC). The city's receiver and the Rhode Island Director of Revenue opposed the suit; the receiver sought injunctive relief. The Rhode Island Attorney General also participated in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was in a fiscal crisis. Pursuant to the Rhode Island Act Relating to Cities and Towns--Providing Financial Stability, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-9-1 et seq., the Director appointed the receiver, who assumed some of the duties of the mayor. The court found that the Act was constitutional. As it applied alike to all cities and town, addressed a statewide concern, did not alter a home rule city's form of government, and was substantially related to public welfare, the Act did not violate R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. The Act's &quot;Declaration of Policy and Legal Standard&quot; and the five-tiered mechanism provided sufficient standards and safeguards to guide the administration of the Act and prevent arbitrary actions. Neither the mayor nor the council members had been removed from office and they failed to establish a claim for procedural due process under R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. As the receiver acted within the authority granted by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 45-9-7, 45-25-10, 45-26-4, and by the city's home rule charter, the court found that the receiver's appointment of a member to the CFHA was proper. Lastly, the receiver satisfied the elements for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the Act was constitutional and that the receiver's appointment was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The service station owners stored gasoline in underground storage tanks. As such, they were obligated to comply with applicable UST Regulations such as 12-030-029 R.I. Code R. &sect; 3.01. The Office of Compliance and Inspection issued a notice of violation following a compliance inspection of the property. The Department of Environmental Management (DEM) Hearing Officer did not give great weight to the owner's testimony because she found his shifting testimony to be of little probative value. The DEM Hearing Officer recommended sustaining the notice of violation. The vagueness argument failed as the owners applied a subjective rather than objective standard to the test for impermissible vagueness. The proper test was whether a person of ordinary intelligence would have understood the regulations. Thus, the owners failed to demonstrate that any of the Regulations were so vague as to violate their due process rights. The Hearing Officer's decision was not in excess of statutory authority, and her decision was not clearly erroneous. The penalties were based on competent evidence.

They alleged system-wide violations of their statutory and constitutional rights, and they sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action alleged that there were violations in how the Truancy Court Program was set up and operated. Plaintiffs sought both declaratory and injunctive relief. The court initially addressed whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. It reviewed in detail the various jurisdictional bases of the courts, as well as the structure of the Truancy Court program. It was noted that the superior court had equitable jurisdiction while the family court did not. However, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-5, the family court had exclusive original jurisdiction concerning a wayward child, who was one within R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 16-19-6. The court concluded that an evidentiary hearing was required to determine the issues, as it was not clear that the superior court lacked jurisdiction. As court administrators and administration did not have unfettered discretion pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 8-10-14 and 8-10-15, the limits of such discretion had to be appropriately determined. Review of the arraignment procedures, right to counsel, and due process claims also required a hearing. U.S. Const. amend. XI and considerations of comity did not bar the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the dismissal motion without prejudice, subject to full development of the facts and context in an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, he was declared a violator of a prior sentence, and was continued on the same sentence. Almost four years later, the State filed a R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f) violation report against defendant in both cases after he was charged with violating R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-5-2. The State acknowledged that defendant was never prosecuted for any criminal charges stemming from the incident. The court found, inter alia, that the 2010 amendment to &sect; 12-19-18 took effect almost six years after defendant's pleas and over two years after he had been found to be a probation violator. Accordingly, it did not apply. Consequently, there was no basis to quash the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advertising company and defendants, Rhode Island Attorney General and Department of Transportation (DOT) cross-moved for summary judgment on the company's claim for declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-30-1 et seq. (1956). The company challenged the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-10.1-3 of the Rhode Island Outdoor Advertising Act (RIOAA) and certain rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company constructed billboards and leased the billboard space to third parties. DOT denied several permit requests. The court held the company alleged a proper injury in fact as DOT denied permits for billboards. The company alleged that &sect; VI(E) of the Outdoor Advertising Rules and Regulations (OARR), which allowed the conversion of legally conforming signs to Trivision or equivalent technology, was unconstitutional and in derogation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Article 1, Section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution, and the Commerce Clause. However, the undisputed evidence revealed no causal connection between the challenged provisions and the company's injury. Therefore, the challenge with respect to the impermissible content-based restrictions on speech failed for lack of standing. The court held R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-10.1-3 was constitutional and it was constitutionally applied to the company as the company was requesting to convert a single-faced billboard into a double faced billboard, in direct violation of &sect; 24-10.1-3. Finally, there was no violation of the Commerce Clause as RIOAA was nondiscriminatory and focused exclusively on Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employer sued defendants, his former employee, the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, other state officials, and an insurer, seeking a declaration that portions of the workers compensation (WC) laws were unconstitutional, and to restrain the Director from assessing a penalty against plaintiffs. Plaintiff sought summary judgment; the employee and Director moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The WC court awarded the employee benefits and denied plaintiff's challenge to the constitutionality of certain WC laws. This suit followed. The superior court held that plaintiff''s overly broad complaint failed to state a claim against the employee on which relief could be granted, but that he should be allowed to amend the complaint. As plaintiff first initiated suit in the WC court--which was competent to hear his constitutional arguments--principles of comity controlled such that the superior court lacked jurisdiction over his claims against the Director. Further, the Director filed suit in the WC court against plaintiff to enforce R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-36-15 (1956) and to assess a civil penalty against him for failure to maintain WC insurance. As plaintiff did not contest &sect; 28-36-15's constitutionality, and alleged no facts to support the conclusion that the Director's actions were not authorized by &sect; 28-36-15, he was not entitled to relief under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the claim. And as plaintiff failed to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of any Rhode Island statute beyond a reasonable doubt, he was not entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's motion to dismiss based upon the lack of a coherent claim against him was reserved. Plaintiff was granted leave to amend the complaint within 20 days in order to properly state a cause of action against the employee. The Director's motion to dismiss was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to police that his &quot;jump&quot; drive contained pornographic images of children. A forensic inspection of his computer yielded images depicting infants and prepubescent boys and girls engaged in sexual intercourse and other sexual activities. Defendant argued that &sect; 11-9-1.3 violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, by criminalizing  &quot;virtual child pornography,&quot; i.e., computer-generated images appearing to depict minor children engaged in sexually explicit conduct and that it impermissibly allocated the burden of proof to the accused to prove that the material was not &quot;real&quot; child pornography. The court disagreed. Under &sect; 11-9-1.3, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the visual depiction possessed by an accused involved the use of a real child. While not obligated to do so, a defendant could present evidence about how the offending depiction could have been made without using real children; this did not constitute shifting the burden of proof. Thus, &sect; 11-9-1.3, was not unconstitutionally overbroad or otherwise infirm due to an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 34-13-1 (1956). The bank also sought a writ of mandamus directing the city's recorder of deeds to record the foreclosure deeds presented by the bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances prohibited the bank from recording a foreclosure deed until it first satisfied the notice and loan conciliation conference requirements prior to the foreclosure sale. The conciliation procedure itself was not burdensome or time consuming but the procedure could not be enforced by denying the bank the ability to record a foreclosure deed. The ordinances were invalid to the extent that they disrupted the State's overall scheme of regulating the transfer of real estate and the recording of instruments. The General Assembly's use of mandatory language in &sect; 34-13-1 demonstrated the legislature's goal of occupying the entire field of the State's recording system. Recording requirements were a matter of statewide concern. As such, it was impermissible for the city to force the bank to meet new requirements before a foreclosure deed could be recorded. Such an enactment was a violation of the Home Rule Amendment, R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2. The court did not invalidate the ordinance provision extending the foreclosure timeline because it did not interfere with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-24-4. In light of the declaratory relief, mandamus relief was not warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the city's ordinances purporting to prevent foreclosure deeds from being recorded were preempted by the State's statutory scheme. The court declined to issue a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and her former husband were divorced in 1999 but their property settlement agreement was not merged into the terms of the final judgment. The property settlement provided that if the former husband died before the marital home was sold, the marital home was to be devised to their two minor children. One of the children had turned 18. Prior to the former husband passing away, he had signed a quitclaim deed to the property and executed a last will and testament. The second wife was the principal beneficiary of each of the instruments. The second wife claimed the minor had no standing. The mother had the right to institute the action on the minor's behalf, and individually, as she was not only the minor's natural guardian but her next friend. Because the property settlement agreement was not merged into the divorce judgment, it retained the characteristics of a contract. The property settlement agreement stated that all of the provisions were binding upon the respective heirs and assigns of the parties. The agreement was, therefore, binding and enforceable not only upon the former husband and his estate, but also upon his assignee, the second wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for summary judgment was granted. The court was going to issue an order to transfer the subject property to the minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a school committee, a school superintendent, and city officials, filed a declaratory judgement action against defendants, a teachers' union, the Rhode Island State Labor relations Board (SLRB) and its members, and state education officials, seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 16-2-9(d) (1956) when it changed certain terms and conditions of employment of the teachers to maintain a balanced budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that &sect; 16-2-9(d) did not empower the committee to disregard the State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), R.I.

The union also argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-30-2, granted broad jurisdiction to the court to determine rights that arose under a statute part of the court's original jurisdiction. The committee after exhausting the statutory impasse resolutions in the SLRA, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-7-13, and the CSTAA, acted lawfully in changing the terms and conditions of teachers' employment in an effort to comply with the balanced budget mandate of R.I. Gen.

The applicants argued that appealing to the zoning board would be futile. However, futility was not applicable because the applicants did not challenge the validity of the regulations. Rather, the applicants challenged the administrative officer's application of the regulations to their plan application. Further, the applicants' final plan application was deficient on many grounds, including some grounds the applicants did not challenge as invalid.

(1956), plaintiff developer sued defendants, a town finance director and a town planner, seeking in Count I a injunctive relief and declaration of its rights as to what vesting period applied to a master plan submitted by plaintiff and approved with conditions by the town planning board. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and the owner of the property obtained a use variance to convert a building into residential condominium units and received master plan approval. Plaintiff and the owner obtained a one-year extension of their use variance, but did not seek another extension until two months after the first extension expired; the request was denied. The court held that the vesting period began when the board approved the master plan, not, as plaintiff argued, when it granted dimensional variances and recorded its decision. As the vesting period began when the prior version of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-23-40(g)(1) was in effect, master plan approval was subject a one-year vesting period, not the two-year period set out in the amendment to &sect; 45-23-40(g)(1). Since plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment as to the intent of &sect; 45-23-40(g)(1), the court had jurisdiction over the matter; therefore, defendants' argument that plaintiff did not exhaust its administrative remedies failed. As plaintiff's purchase contract with the owner gave it an equitable interest in the property, it had standing to bring the suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dentist sought review of a decision from appellee, the Rhode Island Board of Examiners in Dentistry, which suspended his license to practice dentistry for at least two years due to unprofessional conduct in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-3.1-10 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist was a participating provider for a dental insurer. The insurer received complaints regarding the quality of the dentist's care, and it undertook an audit of his office. The insurer filed a complaint with the Board, noting a pattern of care issues, negligence, fraud, and record-keeping violations. The Board issued a summary suspension pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-31.1-19, which was modified as to some procedures. The Board held a hearing and received testimony from numerous witnesses, after which it upheld the summary suspension and found the dentist guilty of unprofessional conduct. On review, the court found that the dentist did not present sufficient evidence that the Board failed to follow proper procedures or that a confidentiality provision under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-31.1-11 and a sequestration order were violated. An expert witness and Board members were not biased, and there were no due process violations by the Board. R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-31.1-16 provided a proper standard of proof. The unprofessional conduct finding was supported by substantial evidence, and the sanctions imposed were proper under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-31.1-17.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 11-9-1.3 (1956), arguing that &sect; 11-9-1.3 was overbroad and vague, in violation of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was troubled by the circular definition of graphic in &sect; 11-9-1.3(c)(6)(v), but found that when measured against the statute's plainly legitimate scope of images depicting children engaging in graphic sexual intercourse, bestiality, masturbation, sadistic or masochistic abuse, or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area, the infringement on constitutionally protected speech was marginal. Such marginal infringement was to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, the proper remedy being reversal of the conviction, not an invalidation of the law. The statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Defendant did not argue why the use of store in &sect; 11-9-1.3(c)(7) was unconstitutionally vague. The statute's definition of sexually explicit conduct in &sect; 11-9-13.(c)(6)(v) as graphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person was not unconstitutionally vague judging the statute as a whole, and the clarity with which the other four types of sexually explicit conduct were defined, even though the use of graphic was arguably unclear. The statute put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of what conduct was illegal.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 12-16-3 (1956), to respondent, a Rhode Island hospital, keeper of the records.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subpoena said the medical records from the Rhode Island hospital may contain evidence depicting injuries and blood alcohol readings of defendant, as well as other evidence which may implicate or exculpate him according to the laws of Massachusetts. The court conducted an in camera review of the records and determined that they were relevant. The court noted that Rhode Island substantive law applied to the instant situation. The court rejected defendant's claim that the medical records were privileged under the Confidentiality of Health Care Communications and Information Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-37.3-4(a) (1956) as he was competent when he granted permission for the blood testing that was done and the blood was not taken at the direction of law enforcement officers. The court held that the blood alcohol test results amounted to confidential health care information but that the need for the information clearly outweighed defendant's privacy interest since the court had the power to compel disclosure of the health care information under R.I.

A fire inspector ordered an outdoor kitchen closed because of a fire hazard related to a grease buildup on the tent-like covering of the kitchen. The owner sought a building permit to replace the tent with a permanent roof. The issue before the court was whether the Board's determination that the proposed roof replacement would violate the requirements of Newport,R.I., Ordinance &sect; 17.72.030 was correct. The court concluded that replacement of the tent-like covering with a sturdier, safer, and more permanent covering did not involve significant physical changes, operate to extend the area that accommodated the hotel use, nor intensify or change the use as a hotel. Nothing in the record revealed that the structure was dimensionally nonconforming or failed to conform to the ordinance's setback requirements. The court found that replacement of the tent-like covering with a more solid roof was not prohibited under &sect; 17.72.030. The court further noted that the proposed changes did not alter the accessory use from that of a kitchen or change the use of the dominant structure.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 15 on the inverse condemnation claim as whether the owner had been deprived of all economically viable use of his property was a predominantly factual issue. An inverse condemnation action was an action at law analogous to a claim that would have been tried to a jury in 1843. Trespass was a legal action, and required a jury trial on demand. The substantive due process count alleged that the Town's collection, discharge, and depositing of trash and solid waste on the property was not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The procedural due process portion charged that the owner's property rights have been deprived without due process of law. The due process claims had to be tried before a jury. It had not been held that municipalities had no right to a jury trial. Even assuming the Town had no constitutional right to a jury trial, it had a statutory right to one under R.I. Gen. Law &sect; 9-31-1 as to any disputed factual issues, liability, and damages for the claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city requested the authority to acquire certain property for the purpose of protecting a watershed. The authority sought the acquisition of the development rights of the owner's property. It filed a complaint against the owners, alleging that they had refused to appoint an appraiser. The owners argued that &sect; 45-50-13 was unconstitutionally vague in violation of their due process rights and that it allowed for condemnation proceedings to be done in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. The superior court held that the supreme court would not apply the vagueness doctrine to an eminent domain statute to ensure fair notice because property owners were not entitled to pre-deprivation hearings. Assuming that the supreme court would consider a vagueness challenge to &sect; 45-50-13 appropriate, the superior court found that &sect; 45-50-13 was not unconstitutionally vague beyond a reasonable doubt. The General Assembly listed specific properties subject to the authority's power of eminent domain. That specificity provided fair notice for those owners whose properties were listed, and it precluded the possibility that authority decisions would be made on an ad hoc and subjective basis.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought a declaration that the municipalities had to assess its gas assets as tangible personal property in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-12.1 (1956). The court found, inter alia, that pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-27 (1956), the statutory remedy contained in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-26 (1956) was the &quot;exclusive&quot; remedy available to the taxpayer. In addition, the declaratory relief sought would amount to a request for a prohibited advisory opinion. The injunctive relief being sought was the type of equitable relief contemplated by &sect; 44-5-27.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's appeal was dismissed because the town failed to allege injury in fact. Far from alleging actual injury in fact, the town argued for the correctness of the Council's decision and merely took issue with its factual findings. As for the marina's appeal, the court found that the subcommittee's recommendation and its findings of fact were supported by the evidence. The court found clear evidence that the Council's members did not limit their activity on the application to the hearing or meeting rooms. Both the chairperson and subcommittee chair opposed the application, combined their efforts to defeat the application, and engaged in ex parte communications, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-13. The court found that the chair and subcommittee chair should have been disqualified from participating in the full Council vote. The court further found that a remand would be improper, as it would have prejudiced the marina due to a ruling of the court rendering the Coastal Resources Management Council unconstitutional due to its makeup. In order that the marina receive a final adjudication of its petition in a timely manner, the court affirmed the subcommittee's recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate argued that the decedent was unconstitutionally deprived of her right to challenge the tax sale and that there was insufficient notice of the sale. The court found, however, that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-24 limited motions to vacate to instances where there was inadequacy of the notice of the petition or where the sale was invalid because taxes were not due. The estate never questioned that the taxes were due, nor did it dispute that the decedent received notice of the petition. There was no evidence that the decedent responded in any way to this formal notice. Although the estate appeared to assert that the statutory scheme was infirm, it failed to allege that the statute was unconstitutional. Further, no notice was provided to the state Attorney General that the constitutionality of the statute was being challenged. Service of process was effectuated on the decedent before the foreclosure of her right of redemption. A hearing was held, and the decedent failed to appear. The court was not allowed to protect the interest of the decedent at the expense of the purchaser. The statutory scheme properly established adequate procedural safeguards to comport with due process.</SPAN></P>

He alleged that shortly after counsel was appointed and before he took counsel's advice to plead nolo contendere, a trial court ruled for two defendants in a separate case that R.I. Gen.

Petitioner alleged that trial counsel should have become aware of that ruling and provided ineffective assistance of counsel in not applying it to his case. The trial court first rejected the State's contention that petitioner was actually filing a motion to shorten his sentence. It then found that he had not demonstrated that he had been prejudiced by counsel's alleged conduct because he had not shown what he would have done differently had counsel applied the earlier ruling, which was not binding on the trial court in petitioner's case, and he did not show counsel could have known that the statute would be repealed.</SPAN></P>

An employee of the employer filed a complaint in the prevailing wages unit of the DLT. He claimed he was not being paid the prevailing wage and the project fell into the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; category. The Prevailing Wage Division Investigator, concluded that the project fell into the prevailing wage category. The Prevailing Wage Board found that it was a public works project which involved construction. The Hearing Officer found that the employer had to pay a civil penalty pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 37-13-14.1(b). The court held there was competent evidence to conclude that the project fell under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 37-13-1 since it consisted of regrading, clearing, improvements, and heavy construction. The DLT's decision finding that the RIRRC and Board complied with the statutory framework of providing information as to the wage that would apply, was not affected by error of law.</SPAN></P>

The owner also sought a variance from the residential density requirements of the Old Harbor Commercial Zone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner claimed that the conditions were not supported by the record and that the Board exceeded its authority by requiring more parking spaces than  required by the ordinance. The court disagreed. The record  indicated that a determination not to count a three space variance in the calculations hinged solely on the change in use of the property from retail to restaurant. The Board could have considered that the building was used as a restaurant and its legal consequences in calculating the required parking spaces. The parking condition was supported by competent, credible record evidence demonstrating concerns over the accessibility of parking for the many uses on the site, and it was well within the Board's discretion to require  that the parking sites be designated in accordance with &sect; 502(A) of the Zoning Ordinance and that parking be accessible and recognizable. The condition addressed legitimate concerns going to the nature of the proposed use. In imposing a requirement that both parking plans be combined, the Board's actions did not amount to an amendment to the ordinance or a substantial change in the lines of established zoning in excess of its delegated authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighter challenged a decision of appellee from the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island (Board), denying the firefighter's R.I.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the language of &sect; 45-21.2-9(a) was clear: a firefighter suffering from an injury sustained while in the performance of duty that physically or mentally incapacitated him or her could apply for accidental disability retirement benefits, regardless of the length of service. The town had no authority to create additional exceptions to the identifiable injury requirement of &sect; 45-21.2-9(a). Even if authority had been delegated to the town, examination of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) revealed that the town did not do so. In &sect; 24.5, the CBA mentioned its applicability to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-19-1 (1956); it did not mention retirement. Section 45-21.2-5(7) instructed the town to address illnesses and injuries not otherwise covered by the accidental disability retirement section. Nothing within the clear and plain language of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-21.2-5(7) suggested that, in addressing these illnesses and injuries, the town could have re-written portions of &sect; 45-21.2-9.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff labor union filed suit challenging an executive order signed by defendant, the Governor of Rhode Island, alleging the Governor violated separation of powers principles; the Distribution of Powers Amendment, R.I. Const. art. 5; and the Contracts Clauses of the state and U.S. Constitutions (R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 12 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, respectively). The union sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executive order reduced the pay of members of certain state labor unions, including that of workers not employed by the executive branch. The court held that under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 28-7-21 and 28-7-25, the Rhode Island Labor Relations Board had exclusive original jurisdiction to determine whether the governor committed an unfair labor practice by promulgating the executive order or otherwise violated state labor laws. However, the court had jurisdiction under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-30-1 to issue a judgment declaring whether the Governor violated the state and federal Constitutions. With respect to the union's constitutional claims, the Governor was undeniably subject to state labor laws, including the legislatively imposed obligation to recognize and collectively bargain with the state employees' bargaining agents; to submit unresolved issues to mediation; and to proceed to binding arbitration in the absence of conciliation. Insofar as the executive order purported to affect state employees other than those employed by the executive department, it violated separation of powers principles, R.I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent the union asked the court to decide the merits of its claims that the Governor violated state labor laws, that claim was denied and dismissed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the issue had not been addressed in Rhode Island, the court declared that the Governor had the inherent power, derived from the state's constitution and statutes, to lay off the sheriffs for fiscal reasons, notwithstanding their appointment to 10-year terms, from which they could be removed for cause, under &sect; 42-29-1. Alternatively, the state's severe budget crisis constituted just cause for the lay offs. The lay offs did not constitute an elimination of positions; the power of the Department of Administration to appoint persons to 10-year terms as sheriffs under &sect; 42-29-1 remained unchanged, and the sheriffs were entitled to return to their positions before the end of their statutory terms if there was no longer a fiscal reason for them to remain on lay off. Exercise of the lay off power, for economic reasons, did not run afoul of the sheriffs' due process rights. As such, the proposed lay offs could proceed. The court opined only as to the Governor's inherent power and did not comment on the wisdom of exercising that power. The court also declined to address whether the sheriffs' executive branch positions could be abolished for fiscal reasons without legislative action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-9.1-1 (1956), petitioner inmate filed a petition for post conviction relief against respondent director of the department of correction alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a bill of particulars that led to a duplicitous verdict and for failure to file a motion to suppress his identification before trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was charged with a probation violation and with witness intimidation, violations of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-19-9 (1956), R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f) and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-32-5 (1956) as amended (Reenactment of 1994). The witness was the inmate's wife. The court found that neither allegation satisfied the heavy burden the inmate had to overcome to maintain an ineffective assistance claim. The State's alleged failure to specify which criminal proceeding the charge of witness intimidation applied did not subject the inmate to the possibility of double jeopardy in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Counsel's strategy was that, regardless of what an eyewitness heard the inmate say to his wife, the wife was not intimidated. That was sound strategy and arguably would have been successful had the wife not testified at trial. Her testimony confirmed the State's claim. The inmate failed to show that a motion for a bill of particulars or a request to clarify the charge would have affected the outcome. The eyewitness' in-court identification confirmed that it was the inmate she saw making the statement to his wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested by police and charged with possession of a controlled substance. He was 17-years-old.

Thereafter, he sought postconviction relief pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-9.1-1 and claimed that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction because he was only 17-years-old when he appeared before it. The trial court found that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-3(C) (1981) defined a child as a person under 18-years-old and, thus, the Rhode Island Family Court had exclusive original jurisdiction over his case under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-5 (1981). It then found that the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over him because the charge, his first and for a nonviolent criminal offense, was not initially brought in the Family Court. Thus, it found that his plea violated his procedural due process rights found in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff realty company filed an action against defendant town, seeking a preliminary injunction. It argued that the town's fee-in-lieu, East Greenwich, R.I., Ordinance 778, which allowed developers to pay a substantial fee if an application for subdivision or land development did not contain the requisite affordable units, was an illegal tax, violated substantive due process, violated equal protection, and constituted an illegal taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town submitted an affordable housing plan to the State and enacted ordinances to implement the plan's design. The company proposed a new subdivision that would have five residential dwellings, but none would be low or moderate income units. The company refused to pay the fee-in-lieu. The trial court held that the fee-in-lieu was not a tax. The State required the town to increase its stock of low and moderate income housing, and it imposed the fee on developers only when they requested permission to construct new housing units but did not propose low or moderate income housing. There was no substantive due process violation. The company failed to establish that any right to develop its property vested or was impaired. The statutory scheme of the town readily survived the minimum scrutiny analysis of the equal protection clause, R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. The company did not prove that the fees would be used for another purpose besides obtaining affordable housing. The town's actions did not constitute a substantial deprivation of property. The fee-in-lieu ordinance allowed developers to continue to develop higher-end housing as long as the town's long-term costs were compensated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated proceeding, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or alternatively, to transfer to the family court, all matters pending in the Superior Court of Rhode Island involving defendants who were alleged to have committed an offense while 17 years old, per R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-6 (1956) (2007 Supp.), and whose cases had not been certified to or waived into the court by virtue of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 14-1-7 or 14-1-7.1 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the validity of an amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-6(c) (1956) (2007 Supp.). Because of the amendment, jurisdiction over 17-year-olds was conferred upon the Superior Court of Rhode Island for a few months until the statute was again amended. Defendant's contended that the amendment unfairly trapped 17-year-olds who are charged with committing criminal offenses during the subject period in the adult system. The court found that the amendments to &sect; 14-1-6 did not deny defendants equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Additionally, the revisions made to &sect; 14-1-6 were reasonably keyed to the legitimate conservation of state funds. Accordingly, the Rhode Island General Assembly's actions did not violate substantive due process. However, the manner in which the decision was implemented failed to consider the entire statutory scheme conferring jurisdiction upon the Family Court of Rhode Island. Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 14-1-5 and 14-1-6, the Superior Court never obtained jurisdiction over 17-year-olds allegedly committing felonies between the enactment of the amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed all complaints and informations filed in the Superior Court as a result of the statutory amendment, and held one defendant's indictment and any other returned indictments in abeyance pending waiver hearings in the Family Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on five pre-trial motions: Plaintiff bank moved for summary judgment. Plaintiff parking lot company cross-moved for partial summary judgment. Defendant airport corporation moved to reopen discovery. The bank, which was a lender to the parking lot company, moved for sanctions. The parking lot company and third-party defendant parking company moved for sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parking lot company and the airport corporation entered into a concession and lease agreement (CLA) regarding parking lot facilities at an airport, which included an indoor parking garage. The Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, at the behest of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the airport corporation, initiated a condemnation action giving it possession of the garage. The Rhode Island Supreme Court declared the condemnation null and void, characterizing it as a &quot;ruse&quot; to allow the airport corporation to avoid the parties' contract. The court held that in light of the undisputed facts and the previous rulings of the Supreme Court, as a matter of law, the airport corporation breached the CLA. The reasonable costs and attorneys' fees associated with the bank's defense of the condemnation action were appropriate. However, there was no provision in the CLA for the award of attorneys' fees to the bank by reason of the airport corporation's breach of the agreement. Nor was there a statutory basis for attorneys' fees. Whatever rights the parking lot company had to peacefully enjoy the benefits it had acquired in the garage were disrupted by the airport corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment to the bank on its claim of breach of contract and found the bank was entitled to damages from the airport corporation as a result of the reasonable litigation costs incurred in its defense and appellate review of the issues in the condemnation case. The amount of those damages had to await further proceedings. The airport corporation's motion to reopen discovery was granted.</SPAN></P>

Intervenor, the Rhode Island Tax Administrator, moved to to dismiss pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) or (6), or, alternatively, for summary judgment. The companies joined in the motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers asserted claims of negligence and violations of the Rhode Island Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (UTPCPA), R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 6-13.1-1 to 6-13.1-27 (1956). The Administrator sought dismissal on grounds that the buyers' claims were tax matters over which the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and that the buyers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. The first buyer, who bought a computer for his business, conceded that he could not bring a UTPCPA claim. Thus, the court held it lacked ancillary jurisdiction over his negligence claims, as his alleged damages were less than the jurisdictional amount of $ 5,000. As the buyers sought not merely tax refunds, but statutory damages arising from violations of the UTPCPA and negligence, the suit did not have to be filed in district court. Although the instant court's ruling on tax questions would have no precedential value, it was authorized to decide such issues in order to resolve the negligence and UTPCPA claims. As the case involved purely legal questions, exhaustion was not required, as there was less need for developing the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first buyer's claims were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction to the extent that he sought damages arising from the companies' alleged negligence.

The DEM filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that under the Industrial Property Remediation and Reuse Act (IPRRA), R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-19.14-1 et seq., in order to determine the existence of a &quot;responsible party,&quot; the DEM was required to bring a separate action in the present court. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the court's exclusive jurisdiction under the Hazardous Waste Management Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-19.1-1 et seq., extended to the IPRRA. R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-19.14-18 specifically granted to the DEM's director the power to effectuate the IPRRA. Thus, the DEM was vested with the power to determine who a &quot;responsible party&quot; was. Next, plaintiff argued that under its declaratory judgment jurisdiction pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-7, the court, not the DEM, should determine the method-of-remediation issue. The court stated that although it had the discretion under &sect; 42-35-7 to invoke its jurisdiction, plaintiff's claims should be addressed administratively. The parties had already begun an administrative action before the AAD, which was essentially identical to the claim at issue here. Furthermore, the DEM was better suited to address the technical and scientific facts at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge of murder arguably encompassed both premeditated and deliberate first degree murder and felony murder, as the indictment did not particularize the nature of the murder charge. The victim was stabbed 18 times. The prisoner and the codefendant admitted to participating in the act of murder during the plea colloquy. The appellate court held the record suggested that the prisoner may have pled guilty to premeditated and deliberate first degree murder or felony murder. As the murder involved repeated stabbings and a lapse of time between when the first robbery occurred and when the stabbings took place, the State had evidence to support the elements of robbery and premeditated and deliberate first degree murder as two separate crimes. Because the face of the plea record was perhaps left intentionally vague as to the nature of his first degree murder conviction, and the prisoner waived his right to an evidentiary hearing by entering into the plea, he could not prove the double jeopardy violation on which his action for post-conviction relief was grounded and his consecutive life sentences for murder and robbery had to stand.</SPAN></P>

A DBR Hearing Officer determined that the appellants' use of essentially the same business name violated R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-5-11(b)(1)(vi) (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 3-5-11(b)(1)(vi) prohibited licensees from using any term or name identified as a chain or common entity. The Hearing Officer found that appellants' business names identified them as such since the names were the same for each store, except for the addition of a geographic location. Appellants were ordered to pay an administrative penalty of $ 5,000 each and their licenses were suspended for 10 business days. The Hearing Officer further required appellants to seek DBR approval of any business name changes. The court upheld the DBR's decision, finding that the Hearing Officer did not abuse her discretion in furthering the statutory scheme applicable to liquor licensees since the names used by appellants were not easily distinguishable, in violation of &sect; 3-5-11(b)(1)(vi). As fellow franchisees, the court determined that appellants were in privity with regard to federal litigation addressing the constitutionality issues raised. The court held that on grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel, any constitutional claim raised by appellants was already adjudicated in federal court against them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the DBR decision and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hearing officer for appellee state business regulation department found that appellant auto body business violated a state statute by operating an unlicensed salvage yard and violated a different state statute by failing to keep adequate records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The auto body business held a license to operate as an automobile body repair shop. While operating that business, two administrative complaints were brought against the auto body business by the state business regulation department. In the first complaint, the state business regulation department charged the auto body business with operating an unlicensed auto wrecking and salvage yard, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-14.2-3. In the second complaint, it was alleged that the auto body business failed to maintain adequate records, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-38-18. The state business regulation department convened a consolidated hearing before a hearing officer. The state business regulation department introduced evidence to support the charges, including the testimony of the chief of auto body and salvage operations for the state business regulation department who had conducted an inspection of the premises and the relevant records. The hearing officer then found that the statutes had been violated. On administrative review, the trial court found that the hearing officer's decisions were adequately supported by evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a towing company and employee, sued and sought in count one of their complaint a declaratory judgment that the police department's written tow list policy was facially unconstitutional or that the tow list policy was unconstitutionally applied to the towing company and employee in violation of their constitutional equal protection rights. Defendant town representatives, and the towing company and employee, moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The towing company and employee filed a complaint in regard to the police department's written tow list policy. The list contained two companies. The towing company sought to become the third company on the list, but had been turned down three previous times over an eight-year period when the towing company submitted its most recent application. The then-police chief rejected the application after concluding that the town was getting a high level of service from the two tow companies. The towing company and employee alleged in their complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the written tow list policy was either facially unconstitutional or, as applied to them, violated their equal protection rights. The towing company and the employee, as well as the town representatives, moved for summary judgment. The trial court found that the facial constitutional challenge was time barred pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-14 since it had not been brought within three years of when the action accrued; in any event, the trial court found that a rational basis existed for the then-police chief's decision and, thus, no equal protection rights had been violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the town representatives' summary judgment motion on count one of the towing company and employee's complaint for a declaratory judgment about the constitutionality of a police department tow list policy. It also denied the town company and employee's summary judgment motion in that regard. Too, it denied the towing company and employee's prayers for equitable relief in count three as they pertained to count one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's Ethics Commission penalty was intended to be civil. The penalty did not bar a criminal prosecution because (1) it was a monetary fine within statutory boundaries that did not impose an &quot;affirmative disability or restraint&quot;; (2) monetary assessments were a traditional civil remedy; (3) the penalty came into play only on a finding of scienter, as the standard for proving a Code of Ethics violation was &quot;knowing and willful,&quot; favoring finding a bar to a criminal prosecution; (4) the penalty did not unacceptably promote retribution and deterrence; (5) the penalty was based on conduct the indictment was based on, favoring finding a bar to a criminal prosecution, but this alone was arguably insufficient to make the penalty criminally punitive in the double jeopardy context; (6) the penalty was rationally connected to a remedial purpose; and (7) the penalty was not excessive in relation to the Code of Ethics' remedial purpose. The false pretenses charge required proof of at least one element not required by the Code of Ethics - the &quot;intent to cheat or defraud,&quot; so it survived the Blockburger analysis and was not double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant doctor sought review of a decision from the Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline, which upheld a decision by appellees, the Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH) and the Director of the DOH, that the doctor had engaged in unprofessional conduct in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-37-5.1 (1956). The Board revoked the doctor's license to practice medicine in Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hospital suspended the doctor from its medical staff after a patient alleged that he sexually molested her during a surgical procedure. The doctor had provided anesthesia during her surgical procedure, and the patient claimed that he fondled her breasts. The doctor's license was summarily suspended by the Director. At a hearing before the Board, a former patient from a different hospital reported similar conduct by the doctor during a different surgical procedure. The Board found the testimony from both patients was credible, that the doctor's claim that he did not commit that conduct and that the patients' thoughts were a result of drugs was not credible, and that the doctor had violated &sect; 5-37-5.1. It revoked his medical license and the doctor sought review under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-15(g) (1956). There was no due process violation by the procedure under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-37-5.2(e)(3) (1956) which did not require hearing committee members to hear testimony. Admission of evidence by various witnesses was proper under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-10(a). A criminal matter that acquitted the doctor had no impact on the administrative proceeding. The Board's decision was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, executrix of the estate of a man killed in an airplane collision, brought a wrongful death suit against defendants, including the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC). The executrix filed a motion to strike certain affirmative defenses asserted by RIAC and RIAC filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This suit arose from a fatal collision between two airplanes on a runway at an airport operated by RIAC. The suit alleged that RIAC negligently contributed to the accident by failing to clear visibility obstructions or close the subject runway. The RIAC asserted various defenses, including that it was entitled to immunity under the public duty doctrine and that any liability was subject to a damages cap. The court found that the RIAC was a state agency and that its power to sue and be sued did not waive the public duty doctrine as an affirmative defense. However, the court went on to find that the operation of the airport was not the type of activity protected under the public duty doctrine because it was not an activity inherently incapable of being performed by private individuals. On the contrary, the court noted that many airports were privately owned and operated. Finally, the court held that any liability imposed on RIAC would not be subject to the $ 100,000 damages cap of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-31-2 because the operation of the airport was proprietary in that operation of a public airport was an activity that could easily be performed by a private-business corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted relief in part for each party. In ruling for RIAC, the court held that RIAC was a state agency and RIAC's power to sue and be sued did not waive the public duty doctrine or place RIAC outside the scope of the Rhode Island Tort Claims Act. In ruling for the executrix, the court held that RIAC was not entitled to immunity under the public duty doctrine, and any liability imposed on RIAC would not be subject to a damages cap.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed site had land situated in zoning districts as delineated in North Smithfield, R.I., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 1.1. The surrounding property owners contended that at least some of the proposed uses in the development were incompatible with the permissible uses in the various zoning districts. To overcome that incompatibility, the developer utilized the procedures for a &quot;land development project&quot; (LDP). The surrounding property owners contended that the characterization of LDP as a &quot;use&quot; in North Smithfield, Conn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 5.4.12 rendered it invalid because it was inconsistent with the Zoning Enabling Act. The court held it would not bar the claims because of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies as defendant zoning and planning boards could not have found the ordinance invalid. The court disagreed that the designation of LDP as a use conflicted with the Zoning Enabling Act. The proper interpretation of the zoning ordinance was to incorporate the &quot;residential, commercial, institutional, recreational, open space, and/or mixed&quot; uses, which made up the definition of LDP, into &sect; 5.4.12. That interpretation was in accord with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-42 (1956).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2004, the EDC condemned a temporary easement in the owner's 750-car parking facility that served an airport.

The court found that one who entered land under a court decree in his favor was not a &quot;trespasser&quot; even though the decree was subsequently reversed. Therefore, because &sect; 42-64-9 was constitutionally adequate and the EDC exercised its condemning authority under a legally effective court order, the EDC and its subsidiary were entitled to summary judgment under R.I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sunday Motor Vehicle Law prohibited defendants from conducting business on Sundays.

Defendants contended that the two laws conflicted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar owner and bar sought a declaratory judgment that the town council: (1) assessed an unconstitutional tax, (2) violated its due process and equal protection rights, and (3) engaged in an improper delegation of power by enacting an ordinance and subsequent resolution requiring them to fund police details from July 3rd to July 5th as a condition of retaining its liquor license. In opposition, the town council maintained that the ordinance and resolution were constitutional because they placed reasonable restrictions on liquor licenses and provided sufficient guidelines to accompany the delegation of power authorized. Additionally, the town council asserted that the disputed charge did not amount to a tax but rather constituted a reasonable assessment to accomplish the purposes of the governing regulation. The trial court declared that the ordinance was constitutional and valid in all respects. It found that the charge imposed was a reasonable assessment to provide extra police presence to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the town's citizens at a time and location where certain festivities, and associated drunkenness and reckless behavior threatened the citizens.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought a declaration that certain portions of the Pawtucket, R.I., Zoning Ordinance (ZO) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants informed the Board that they wanted to withdraw a prior request for a variance to install signage on the property and instead, they intended to submit an application for a special use permit. Appellants claimed that despite the DZCE's issuance of an interpretive certificate in their favor, he later denied their request for a permit in order to have electronic message boards attached to the building. The DZCE's denial was based on the opinion of the director of planning and redevelopment (DPR). The Board denied an appeal from the DZCE's decision. On judicial review, the court found that reliance on the DPR's opinion was proper, as he was responsible for the comprehensive plan, which covered the sign issue. Although the DZCE and the Board based their decisions on an amended ZO, the DPR's decision was based on the prior version. As there was no substantially completed application submitted when the ZO was amended, reliance on the amended version was not error under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-44 (1956). There was no First Amendment violation, as the ZO was content-neutral, and it served a substantial governmental interest concerning aesthetics and traffic safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the 1979 reforms shortened the statute of limitations for child molestation. The trial court held that the plain language of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-12-17 as enacted during 1979 and 1981 was clear: specified crimes had no limitation for prosecution, and all others had a three-year limit. The trial court would not infer that a statute of limitations applied retroactively. However, the Rhode Island Supreme Court had found that there had never been a statute of limitations for first-degree sexual assault. The 20-year delay in bringing an indictment was not unconstitutionally excessive. The speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment did not apply until a defendant was charged or arrested. A statute of limitations was to guard against the prejudice resulting from a pre-indictment delay, but there was no such statute here. Defendant failed to show that he suffered actual prejudice from the pre-indictment delay or that the State delayed in order to gain a tactical advantage. Thus, defendant's general due process claims failed. Finally, defendant was not deprived of his speedy trial right as he never asserted his speedy trial right and he was never charged or arrested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving a recommendation from the state's board of examiners of electricians, the department cited the electricians for allegedly performing electrical work without required licensing. It was undisputed the electricians did not have electrical licenses, but they claimed the work they performed did not require a license. The court rejected the electricians' substantive due process claims because R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 5-6-4(c), 5-6-32, which authorized the department's actions, were a proper exercise of the state's police power. However, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-6-32(a) required a pre-deprivation hearing to impose fines as a penalty, so the department's post-deprivation hearing did not satisfy procedural due process. Under &sect; 5-6-32(b), a pre-deprivation hearing was not required to for the cease and desist orders, and a prompt post-deprivation hearing on the merits satisfied procedural due process as to those orders. Finally, giving proper deference to the agency's definition of an &quot;apparatus,&quot; the court upheld the department's determination that the medical equipment supports installed by the electricians were an &quot;apparatus&quot; that required licensing under R.I.

Gen. Laws &sect; 42-128.1-1, et seq., sought a judgment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-30-1 declaring that exceptions afforded by the Act to other categories of rental unit owners offended the equal protection clause of R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that the legislature unlawfully exempted pre-1978 rental dwelling units that were comprised of two or three units, one of which was occupied by the property owner, from the lead abatement and other requirements of the statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-128.1-8(e)(4). The legislature's rationale for the exemption was that because the owner was living in the unit, the owner would have the lead paint problem dealt with out of his own self interest. Data presented by witnesses indicated that a significant percentage of children who lived in multi-family homes and were found to suffer from high lead levels lived in units which had an owner-occupant. The court found that these statistics supported a finding that owner-occupants were not taking the required steps to abate the lead paint problem. The court held that there was no rational basis for allowing the children who lived in these two and three-unit owner-occupied buildings to be at risk while children living in other units enjoyed the protection of the Rhode Island Lead Hazard Mitigation Act. Thus, the exemption in question violated terms of equal protection clause of the Rhode Island Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The basis of the misdemeanor manslaughter counts was defendants' alleged failure to follow the Fire Safety Code, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-28.6-15 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants leased a building in which they operated a nightclub. A fire spread throughout the nightclub during a rock band's performance, resulting in the death of 100 people. Defendants were alleged to have affixed foam to the walls of the nightclub that was not adequately fire resistant, in violation of &sect; 23-28.6-15, the foam statute. The State asserted that the foam was not adequately flame resistant and proximately caused the 100 deaths. The court clarified that the foam statute unambiguously created a duty on owners and lessees of buildings to render acoustical materials flame resistant and that the penalty statute contained in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-28.3-9 (1956) clearly referenced the foam statute and provided for prosecution upon its violation. Defendants' assertion that notice from fire officials was required before a violation of the foam statute created an offense subject to prosecution was held without merit as no such notice requirement was provided within the statute. The court held that the State sufficiently alleged defendants committed misdemeanor manslaughter by alleging the creation of a substantial and unjustifiable risk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department denied the application upon finding that the applicant's income exceeded the maximum eligibility standard for child care subsidy. That initial decision was appealed and at a hearing, a Department representative indicated that the applicant's gross wages were annualized and child support payments from the child's mother were added. The applicant claimed the methodology was erroneous because he was only a seasonal employee and the child support should have been offset by child support payments he made to other children from a prior marriage. The Department again denied the application, and judicial review was sought. The court agreed with the Department, finding that the applicant was not categorically or income eligible under R.I. Code R. 0850.02 where there was no evidence that he was receiving any cash assistance under the Family Independence Program or was participating in an employment plan, as required by R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a tenants' organization and others, brought various claims against defendants, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), the City of Providence, Rhode Island, School Board, and the Acting Director of the Department of Public Property of the City of Providence, regarding the construction and operation of certain public schools that were built on a former landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other claims, plaintiffs contended that the DEM violated &sect; 5 (R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-19.14-5 (1956)) of the Industrial Property Remediation and Reuse Act (IPRARA), codified at R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 23-19.14.1-1 et seq., in failing to consider the issues of environmental equity, and in failing to provide proper notice and community involvement. The DEM countered that the IPRARA was inapplicable or, if the statute did apply, that the DEM substantially complied with, or exceeded, its requirements. The court found that when approving the city's Site Investigation Report and Remedial Action Work Plan, not one of the documents filed in connection with the site remediation process even mentioned &quot;environmental equity,&quot; and that by failing to implement the regulatory process and failing to require the city to notify abutters in a timely fashion, the DEM did not ensure that abutters were notified. Given the nature of the project and the make up of the impacted community (low income and minority) the necessity for the DEM to make some effort to provide effective access was apparent. Simply housing the relevant public records at DEM headquarters was not enough to satisfy the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other conclusions of law the court found that the DEM violated the IPRARA by failing to develop and implement a process that ensured community involvement throughout the investigation and remediation of the contaminated sites where the schools were built. The parties were directed, within thirty days of the decision's filing, to confer with each other to either submit a proposed remedy, or submit suggested dates for hearing on a remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an underlying contractual dispute, the parties stipulated to a judgment in the supplier's lien action. The supplier then moved for attorneys' fees under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-19. The buyer did not challenge the supplier's designation as the prevailing party in the lien action. Rather, the buyer's objection was that the lion's share of the attorney fees were, in fact, incurred in prosecuting the contract claim, not the lien. The supplier argued that the overlap of facts and law between the two claims essentially rendered them one claim for the purpose of fees. The court found there was no statutory or contractual justification for attorney fees on the contract action and that granting fees for work on both claims would be contrary to Rhode Island's long standing practice against awarding attorneys' fees without specific contractual or statutory authority. Since the jury denied recovery on the breach of contract claim, there were justiciable issues on both sides of that issue to prevent fees under the frivolous claim statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospital-linked health insurer appealed a decision of respondent Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (DBR) finding that it had violated R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-19.2-7 (1956) and requiring that certain directors reimburse the insurer for coverage. It sought a declaration that the statute violated the Contracts Clause and equal protection and due process guarantees, and an injunction against its enforcement against the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section &sect; 27-19.2-7 precluded regulated nonprofit health care providers and insurers from compensating their directors, pending appointment of a state health insurance commissioner. The DBR had proceeded against the insurer when it discovered that certain directors had been given free health care coverage. The manner of reporting the coverage to tax authorities supported the DBR's determination that the coverage constituted compensation. The court held that the insurer failed to carry its burden of showing that the statute violated the Rhode Island and United States Constitutions by impairing a contract. For one thing, no contract had been shown to exist, and for another, the statute was a reasonable exercise of the police power to assure that the public was not victimized by corrupt health care providers and insurers. That same police power also overcame the insurer's equal protection and due process arguments, since the directors were not a protected class and since there was no contract guaranteeing them a property interest in the coverage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fisherman sought review of a decision of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (D.E.M.) which denied him a particular commercial fishing license.

Department of Environmental Management 7 unconstitutional and order that he be given the requested fishing license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisherman applied for a principal effort commercial fishing license with shellfish/quahog and restricted finfish endorsements under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 20-2.1-5 (1956). The D.E.M. denied his request as &sect; 20-2.1-5 allowed only those who had such licenses as of the end of the previous year to obtain the license again, essentially prohibiting any new applicants from receiving a license. The court held that the fisherman's fundamental &quot;rights of fishery&quot; were not violated because he was granted a commercial license and maintained the right to fish recreationally. Though the moratorium on new licenses might not have been the best possible method of reaching the D.E.M.'s stated goals, under a rational basis review, it did not have to be. The fisherman did not persuade the court that either a fundamental right or a suspect class was involved. Thus, his arguments failed to trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny. Additionally, the number of fisherman with permits was reasonable in accomplishing stated goals set forth in &sect; 20-2.1-2. Finally, both R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 20-2.1-5(1)(ii) and Rule 7 of the Rules and Regulations Governing the Management of Marine Fisheries were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The probate court approved the buyer's purchase of the property. The buyer and the executor entered into a purchase and sales agreement. A real estate attorney, while researching the titles to the property uncovered tax title problems. Delays ensued due to the buyer's obtaining funding for redemption purposes on the property. The buyer assiduously, and at considerable expense, moved forward with the permitting process by securing a building permit for a single-family dwelling as well as a residential assent from the Coastal Resources Management Council. An appraiser testified that the property had increased in value from the agreement date. The buyer stated that he was ready, willing, and able to close. The executor contended that the buyer was not entitled to specific performance because he was confronted with an unmarketable title; and he failed thereafter to elect to take title subject to the defects, or request a return of his deposit and cancel the contract, thereby placing himself in breach. The court found that the buyer acted with due diligence and in good faith in the transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his sexual assault trial, the inmate contended that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the element of force and coercion. Thereafter, the inmate sought postconviction relief. In granting the petition in part, the court determined that the decision in Saluter held that the instruction given by the trial court were erroneous because it circumvented the State's required burden of proof. A defective instruction relating to the burden of proof was never considered a harmless error because it deprived the inmate of his right to a trial by jury. The instruction should have been given with a further explanation to the jurors regarding their responsibilities and the State's obligation to prove each element of the crime charged. The inmate's failure to raise the issue at trial did not preclude appellate review because there was no sandbagging by defense counsel. The court noted that the Saluter case announced a watershed rule necessary to the fundamental fairness of a criminal proceeding involving sexual assault. Finally, the inmate's argument concerning duplicitiousness was rejected because the State properly responded to the bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. Substantial evidence showed the physician was negligent under &sect; 5-37-5.1(19). The testimony of a doctor who saw the patient after her final visit to the physician six days earlier, another doctor, and the patient's son established that the physician was grossly negligent in the documentation and keeping of the patient's medical records and that he failed to document or diagnose the cancerous lump. That &quot;inadequate recordkeeping&quot; was not specified as form of unprofessional conduct in &sect; 5-37-5.1(19) did not mean that the physician's due process rights were violated by considering this as grounds to discipline him as he should have known that failure to properly document his patient's medical condition was grossly negligent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants for medical malpractice. In answering interrogatories, plaintiff stated that his medical bills were paid by a third party insurer and that he received temporary disability benefits and social security disability payments as a result of the injuries he sustained. Defendants asserted the collateral source rule, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-19-34.1, as a defense, and plaintiffs sought to strike the defense, asserting its application was unconstitutional. The court found that although plaintiffs' motion did not specifically designate the constitutional provisions that allegedly invalidated the statute, the content of the memorandum suggested an equal protection analysis. The court then determined, under a rational basis analysis, that the statute was constitutional, because, by shifting or spreading some of the financial risk for medical malpractice claims to the collateral sources, it was conceivable that the cost of insurance to medical providers might thereby be reduced. Accordingly, the court denied the motion and ruled that defendants could at trial introduce evidence of payments received by plaintiff that were defined as collateral sources.</SPAN></P>

Respondents, the mayor and other officials, argued that the provision was a denial of equal protection and that even if the requirement was valid, it would be inequitable to enforce it under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 8 provided that home rule charters could be amended only upon the vote of the people. Voters had rejected an effort to repeal the requirement that city solicitors and certain other officials be qualified electors of the municipality, but due to an error, the provision did not appear in the printed charter. The mayor argued that he relied on that version when he appointed the solicitor. He argued that the provision invidiously discriminated against nonresidents and that, in any case, because of his reliance, his appointee should be allowed to stay and be replaced when a new mayor was elected. The court held, first, that the charter provision approved by the people was the only valid, effective version, and that the solicitor's appointment certainly violated it. Since &quot;qualified electors&quot; was not an inherently suspect classification, it reviewed the rule for a rational relationship to proper ends of government, and saw a number of reasons why it might seem a good idea to have local electors serve in that position. Finally, since no one in city government had the power to declare that the law was that which it was not, there could be no equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

Second, the homeowner failed to place a cap on the cost and determine the method of how the price was to be computed, even though he continued to make periodic payments. The contractor was also not without fault. He delayed in presenting the bill and had run into a significant shortfall on the job. After viewing the evidence, the contractor was to be paid for the time put into the project, the materials purchased, and a profit. While no firm price was ever agreed to, it was clear that the contractor would not construct the home for less than $ 250,000. Further, the homeowner employed several other contractors to work on construction. These contractors were paid at the standard rates applicable for both skilled and unskilled labor. Because the contractor accepted a substantial risk by not placing this agreement in writing, he was limited to a profit of 10 percent. However, due to defects which remained in the workmanship, his overall profit was reduced. Credit was also given for the homeowner for amounts paid to an electrician.</SPAN></P>

In the first action, plaintiff plumber filed a motion to dismiss a petition and to strike the lis pendens. In the second, plaintiff debtor filed a motion to discharge an injunction bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged deprivations occurred after the 2003 statute was enacted and effective. Owners had an opportunity to seek a hearing immediately upon the receipt of a notice of intention, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-17.1(a)(2), or a claimed lien, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-17.1(a)(4). However, neither party requested an immediate show cause hearing. Instead, both defendant property owners claimed their inability to have a pre-deprivation hearing, though they never requested a hearing on the taking. In the debtor's case, no mechanics' lien existed, as it employed a method to intentionally circumvent the lien ex parte and the lien was discharged. Therefore, it lacked both an injury in fact and standing. Thus, its motion to discharge the bond lacked merit. As for the plumber's case, any deprivation could have been challenged by a prompt hearing. By way of the show cause citation and hearing, the homeowner had the opportunity to promptly question the sufficiency of the potential lien. Thus, due to the resolution of the constitutional infirmities of the statute by the legislature, the plumber's motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mechanics' lien law analyzed was constitutionally valid as applied in both actions. In the first action, the motion to dismiss was denied. In the second, the motion to discharge the bond was denied.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that there was no basis for vacating the consent judgment under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) because the subsequently overruled precedent relied on by the superior court did not have direct preclusive effect on the parties' consent judgment, and there was no evidence of any harm or monetary loss by the town if the consent judgment remained in effect. The court finally held that there were no extraordinary circumstances for vacating the consent judgment under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance allowed for the creation of overlay use districts within the city, and specified, in accordance with Rhode Island zoning statutes, that any such districts would be shown on overlay zoning district maps, to be maintained in the clerk's office. When the city amended the ordinance to create a new district, the Downcity District, at Providence, R.I., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 101.7, it did not amend its maps (which were, in any case, not kept available in the clerk's office), nor did it give notice to affected landowners, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-53 (1956). Two landowners who had been assessed fines for failing to seek district design committee approval before they demolished an old gasoline station on their land therefore challenged the validity of the amendment and sought protection from any further enforcement efforts. The court agreed that the amendment creating the district was of no effect because of noncompliance with all the formalities intended to notify landowners of their inclusion in a district, and further held that they had met their burden of showing that permanent injunctive relief was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this medical malpractice action, the executrix alleged that the healthcare providers were negligent in failing to diagnose the executrix' decedent with Hodgkins lymphoma, which ultimately led to death. The parties settled the case, agreeing to dismiss all claims with the exception of one. The parties stipulated that Medicaid payments were made and that the only issue remaining was whether the CSS applied and acted to preclude recovery of those payments. The executrix argued that the Medicaid payments were not included in the CSS and were recoverable as damages. The parties filed cross motion for judgment, which the court treated as motions for summary judgment. The court interpreted the CSS and concluded that Medicaid was not included because it was not listed in the statute and it did not fit any of the specifically enumerated payments. Therefore, evidence of those collateral source payments were not admissible in a medical malpractice action. The court found that the executrix was not precluded by the CSS from recovering medical expense damages paid by Medicaid, so the executrix was entitled to judgment in the amount of those payments, plus pre-judgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electrical subcontractor (ES) filed an action against defendants, a general contractor (GC) and a company, seeking to enforce a mechanics' lien. The ES also filed suit against defendant, the president of the GC, to recover damages for breach of contract. Defendants filed a counterclaim, seeking damages against the subcontractor for breach of contract and negligence. All actions arose out of building contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The GC and the ES entered into oral agreements for work on a variety of houses and on the president's house. The parties eventually had an argument and the ES did not return to work. The ES filed a notice of intention to claim liens for work performed. The GC contended that it was owed money expended in finishing the job, which was over the amount allegedly due to the ES. After trial, the court declared the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien statute, as well as R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 34-28-17.1(1), unconstitutional as violative of due process. The oral contract with the president was enforceable, based on mutual assent, consideration, and sufficient specificity, but the ES did not substantially perform under that or the other contract. However, the court found that the ES breached its contract by failing to perform skillfully, carefully, in a workmanlike manner, and diligently. The court also found that such failure amounted to negligence by the ES. The court found that, although management and supervision fees, as well as interest, were not proven to a reasonable degree of certainty or by competent evidence, an award to defendants for costs expended was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition to enforce the mechanics' liens and denied the ES's claims. The court granted damages to defendants, which included costs expended on permits and in hiring outside parties to finish or correct work. The court denied management and supervision fees and interest to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor argued that the Board's findings were not supported by the substantial weight of the evidence. Among other things, the court concluded that evidence that the doctor made an anonymous report to the Department of Children, Youth, and Their Families when the standard testified to by another doctor required her to state her name and follow up with a written report, supported the Board's finding that the doctor's complaint constituted unprofessional conduct. The court also found evidence to support the Board's finding that outdoor treatment of patients and failure to transfer records constituted unprofessional conduct. As for the doctor's contention that the admission of hearsay unfairly biased the administrative proceedings, the court disagreed since evidentiary standards in administrative proceedings permit admission of hearsay. Next, the court noted that the Board's decision, which included a thorough analysis of its findings on each charge was not arbitrary or capricious. Finally, the court held that the suspension of the doctor's license was appropriate based on her failure to submit to physical and psychiatric examinations conducted by Board approved professionals.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, legislative officials, supported the plan, as did three intervenor towns. Defendants filed a motion for judgment pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 52(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the plan was unconstitutional as violative of the compactness requirement of R.I. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. They also contended that the districts were not &quot;contiguous&quot; and that the districts were not &quot;as compact in territory as possible.&quot; Defendants and the towns supported the plan, arguing that contiguity, which differed from compactness, was not constitutionally mandated. Further, they claimed that the districts actually were contiguous either by land, bridge, or via bodies of water. The case was heard without a jury and the court made clear findings of fact pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (2003), holding that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the plan was unconstitutional in any manner. There was no burden shifting to defendants, and the court thoroughly reviewed factors such as compactness, contiguity, other boundary concerns, communities of interest, or political gerrymandering. The &quot;compactness&quot; requirement referred to more than geography, the population deviation was within the accepted range, and there was insufficient evidence to show political gerrymandering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department reviewed the park's standard lease and rules, and determined that it violated statutory requirements that parks absorb costs of water use and that parks' restrictions on pets not prevent residents from replacing grandfathered pets who had died.

The park challenged the constitutionality of the statutes, but failed to identify any particular United States or Rhode Island constitutional provisions that had been violated. Reviewing generally for substantive due process and equal protection, the court noted that Rhode Island's legislature had found that mobile home park residents were relatively defenseless tenants, in need of special protections.

Probative evidence supported the Department of Business Regulation's decision that the owner's rule requiring residents owning a washing machine, dishwasher, or garbage disposal to assume the cost of maintaining their septic systems violated R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-44-7(1)(vii).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor filed a petition to enforce a mechanics' lien against defendants, a property owner and a lessee, seeking to recover for work done and materials furnished to defendants, and asserting claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit. Defendants filed two counterclaims alleging breach of contract, fraud, and misrepresentation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor and lessee's cost-plus time and materials contract contained a &quot;target price&quot; --an estimate that did not account for factors outside the contractor's control. The court found that the contractor established its breach of contract and quantum meruit claims and the lessee failed to establish any defenses. The contractor's cost-plus billings were reasonable. That the project's estimated cost was $ 30 million but its actual cost was $ 90 million was due in part to the lessee; further, the lessee failed to show that the contractor acted with gross negligence or fraud. Claims of uncompleted work, even if proved, were irrelevant; since the contractor was entitled to payment only for work actually done, by definition there were no damages. The lessee failed to prove breach of contract. As to its fraud and misrepresentation claim, it failed to prove intent, reliance, or causation. The mechanics' lien was unenforceable, because the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Law &sect; 34-28-1 et seq., was unconstitutional under the U.S. and Rhode Island Constitutions for failing to require a hearing to determine the validity of a lien until after the filing of a petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment entered in favor of the contractor and against the lessee on both the breach of contract and the quantum meruit counts; the contractor was entitled to prejudgment interest and costs. On the lessee's breach of contract, fraud, and misrepresentation claims, judgment entered in favor of the contractor. The contractor's mechanics' lien petition was dismissed and its request for attorney's fees was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-45-1(a)(1), a sub-section of the so-called disorderly conduct statute, which prohibited persons from intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engaging in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior. He was charged based on actions in his home. He moved to dismiss the charges against him and argued the statute was unconstitutional due to vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disorderly conduct statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-45-1(a)(1), was clear and unambiguous. Had the legislature intended that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-45-1(a)(1), (2) be considered together, it would have joined those two sub-sections with the conjunction &quot;and.&quot; To the extent that the conduct charged occurred in defendant's own home and disturbed no one outside the home, the case was one of first impression. When applied to private annoyances, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-45-1 failed to set forth standards to guide the police and the courts to avoid arbitrary, discriminatory enforcement. To the extent that the disorderly conduct statute criminalized noisy, boisterous behavior in the home, it invited the state to intrude into domestic matters beyond those necessary for the protection of family member safety. Acts at home, that did not injure or threaten the safety of family members were not to be prosecuted criminally. As it related to conduct committed by a person in his or her private residence which disturbed no one outside the home, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-45-1 failed to set forth sufficient standards and was, without limitation, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State said defendants' motion was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of their pleas. Neither defendant could have been fully aware of possible defenses and objections until a later time as the State did not submit grand jury tapes or a transcript in response to defendants' discovery requests, but merely advised how to obtain the tapes. The State should have immediately forwarded copies of these tapes to defendants upon its receipt of them, pursuant to its continuing discovery obligation under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 16. It did not violate the purpose of the time limits in R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12 to inquire into alleged defects before going through a trial to allow defendants more time to file their motion. Because the State had no obligation to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, defendants' motion to dismiss because a grand juror's inquiry into the possibility of hearing from defendants was denied had to be denied. The prosecutor's conduct did not meet the requisite threshold for dismissing an indictment, as it was not shown the challenged conduct substantially influenced the decision to indict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a general contractor and a plumbing company, filed petitions under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 34-28-10 to -13 to enforce their mechanics' liens on the real property of petitioner property owners. The owners deposited sums equal to the amounts claimed into the registry of the court, and filed motions to dismiss in which they challenged the constitutionality of the Rhode Island mechanics' liens statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 34-28-1 to -37.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both petitioners claimed they were owed money for improvements they made to the owners' property. The court held that the mechanics' liens statute implicated a significant property interest, and applied the U.S. Supreme Court's Mathews test to determine whether the statute provided due process. Under the first prong of Mathews, the private interest implicated by the mechanics' lien statute was of tremendous significance. Under the second prong, the risk of erroneous deprivation permitted by the statute was substantial. The &quot;due process&quot; afforded the property owner consisted of no more than recording a sworn statement. Once the notice of intent to claim lien was recorded, the lien was perfected and the negative repercussions to the property owner began to flow, before any judicial determination was made as to the lien's validity. The ex parte proceedings under the statute posed an unacceptable peril of error. Under the third prong, the statute was so lacking in minimal constitutional protections that the potential governmental burden entailed by an additional procedural requirement was far outweighed by the benefits incident to the fundamental principles of due process.</SPAN></P>

Because the zoning board was considering an amendment to the zoning ordinance at the time of the applications, it postponed review until after the amendment's passage. The zoning board conducted public hearings on the applications. The court held the citizen was not entitled to individual written notice of the proposed zoning amendment under R.I. Gen.

While the licensee was pursuing its challenge, the town council passed an ordinance that codified its practice of assigning police officers to establishments during the holiday weekend. The court held that the holiday activities were sponsored by the town, not the licensee. In the absence of adequate guidelines promulgated by the town council, the chief of police did not have the authority to regulate the licensee pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-7-7.3 (1956) by requiring the licensee to pay fees for the deployment of officers, and having done so amounted to an impermissible exercise of police authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged a decision of appellee, the Smithfield Zoning Board of Review (Rhode Island), which granted the landowner a dimensional variance with regard to the subdivision of his property but conditioned the variance on the requirement that there not be any further subdivision of the property. Appellee individual Board members were also named.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner petitioned the Board for permission to subdivide his 50-acre property into two parcels. A public hearing was held and the Board granted the requested dimensional variance, conditioned on the requirement that the property not be further subdivided. The landowner appealed, seeking modification of the decision to leave intact the requested variance while eliminating the condition. The court granted the relief sought by the landowner, concluding that the Board lacked the power to condition its grant of the dimensional variance on a total ban on all further subdivision of the lot. The Board could not unilaterally append a condition to a decision granting zoning relief that extended its power under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-43 into the realm of subdivision regulation. Moreover, the condition was not found by the Board to further the intent and purposes of the comprehensive plan nor was there competent evidence in the record from which such a finding could have been made. Moreover, even if the Board had the authority to impose such a condition by consent, there was insufficient evidence to indicate that such a condition was agreed to by and between the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) regulations to conserve summer flounder. One regulation set a legal catch limit under R.I. Dep't Envtl. Mgmt. Reg. 7.7.2-2, allowing the catch limit to be amended by filing a notice with the secretary of state and publishing a news release. The regulation was frequently amended, and this procedure did not comply with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-3, on amending an agency regulation, as 30 days' notice and a hearing opportunity was not provided, and the proper adoption of R.I. Dep't Envtl. Mgmt. Reg. 7.7.2-2 did not allow the amendments. R.I. Dep't Envtl. Mgmt. Reg. 7.7.5-1c, requiring defendants to notify law enforcement before offloading their illegal catches, was not properly adopted. It violated due process by penalizing totally passive conduct and because defendants had no way to know if their catches exceeded the maximum. The regulation violated defendants' self-incrimination privileges by requiring them to report their illegal activity to law enforcement, rather than neutrally requiring all fishermen to report their catches.</SPAN></P>

The planning director issued a zoning certificate, but one that stated that the proposed plant would violate the prohibition on storage or piping of petroleum products in a Groundwater Protection area. The property owners then instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that an asphalt plant would be a permitted use. They appealed the dismissal of their action to the zoning board of review. It found that, because liquid asphalt cement was a petroleum product, it was included in the prohibition on the storage and piping of such products in a Groundwater Protection area. After the trial court reviewed the entire record, it found that the findings, conclusions, and adverse decision were not clearly erroneous, in light of the substantial evidence in the whole record, and, thus, the zoning board of review's decision was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

An improvement was a valuable addition to property or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than repairs or replacement of waste.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation made a pharmaceutical product in 20,000-liter tanks and sought height variances for several buildings. The property owner had standing to appeal the decision granting the variances as an abutting landowner and because the decision could adversely affect its property rights. The corporation's request was not barred by the doctrine of administrative finality, due to a previously granted variance request as to the same property, because the prior request was not denied. Substantial evidence before the board supported its finding that the corporation had no other reasonable alternative to enjoy a legally beneficial use of its property and that a 90 foot height variance was the least relief necessary. Due to the quality control lab's need for ventilation and mechanical space, the corporation had no other reasonable alternative than to request a height variance for that building. The corporation's utility generation facilities were incidental and subordinate to its pharmaceutical production and, therefore, an accessory use not requiring a special use permit. The board made inadequate findings regarding a variance for the warehouse building.</SPAN></P>

EDC filed its request for election of a superior court trial over a year after the 30-day period for making the election, as provided in &sect; 28-5-24.1(b), had expired. The court held that the doctrine of nullum tempus did not save EDC, a governmental agency, from the 30-day limitation period, as the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-5-1 et seq., specifically included the state and all its political subdivisions within its definition of &quot;employer.&quot; It rejected EDC's claim that its agents lacked the authority to waive its right to a court trial. EDC was bound by the decision of its counsel of record to waive the right to a court trial, as this procedural decision with regard to litigation was within his implied and apparent authority as agent. As notice of the 30-day period for making the election for a court trial was received by EDC's chief executive officer, under R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 39-14-3 precluded taxicab companies from operating outside the area authorized by their certificates of necessity, and case law established that this meant that while passengers could be taken anywhere, they could only be picked up within an operating area.  R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 39-14-11 authorized criminal sanctions and civil penalties for violations. The taxi company received several notices that its practice of picking up passengers outside its operating area in response to telephone calls received at its offices inside the operating area violated its certificate, but it continued the practice until the regulatory agency commenced an enforcement proceeding. The court held that substantial evidence supported the agency's determination that the company had violated its certificate and the statute, and there was no abuse of discretion in imposing stiff civil penalties, despite the failure to impose criminal sanctions. Finally, neither statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the company, given the availability of case law as well as the many warnings provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administrative decision in its entirety and denied the company's request for attorneys' fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

The decision to impose administrative penalties did not implicate the right to a trial by jury. The substantial due process rights of the insurer were not prejudiced. Moreover, the penalties imposed by department were not arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence and did not represent an unwarranted exercise of discretion. However, the department's order requiring the insurer to submit for review and approval any communication the insurer intended to send to its customers regarding the decision violated constitutional and statutory provisions, as it represented an unconstitutional infringement on speech under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the case for the superior court to determine attorney's fees and costs to be awarded to plaintiff landowners from defendants, a city's tax assessors and collectors (city). The landowners were initially forced to seek legal protection of their rights as a result of what the courts determined to be the city's retaliatory illegal taxing scheme resulting in $ 3,565,971 of liens to the landowners' properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court ordered Rhode Island to pay a condemnee $ 10, 650,000 damages, $ 110 per square foot, in a condemnation proceeding. The city's share was 50 percent. The city then used that valuation to assess the landowners' neighboring properties for six years of back taxes. The superior court adjudicated that, and then the city's subsequent 1999 assessment illegal. The superior court then ordered the landowners to submit a demand for attorney's fees and costs related to the illegal tax assessments and prosecution of the ensuing claims. The city appealed the order before the landowners could assert their claims for attorney's fees and costs. The landowners were placed in a position where aggressive legal action was necessary to preserve their legal rights against the illegal assessment actions taken by the city and the subsequent threat of financial loss reaching $ 3,565,971 in illegal tax liens. The extensive legal battle the landowners were forced to mount to protect their legal rights directly resulted from the city's illegal taxing scheme and its subsequent evasion of numerous court orders. That and several other factors determined the reasonable fees allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's order awarded the landowners all attorney's fees and costs resulting from the litigation, totaling $ 316,239.</SPAN></P>

As to the fine due to the president's refusal to answer the questions posed to her by the hearing officer, the superior court held that the imposition of a fine was not erroneous since there were no criminal allegations or charges pending before the president and under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 39-4-21, 3-12-34 none of the president's answers could be used against her in future criminal proceedings. The court found, however, that the $ 22,000 fine assessed exceeded the agency's statutory authority since the refusals were all in response to substantially similar questions, thereby amounting to only one offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A declaratory and injunctive action was filed to determine whether R.I.

It was dismissed and remanded to allow the governor to become a plaintiff. The appellate court held that the governor lacked standing since he was not personally injured. The attorney general was the appropriate official to bring actions on behalf of the public. The action was also not &quot;ripe&quot; for adjudication since the general assembly had 10 years in which to require a constitutional convention. Since the electorate did, in fact, reject a proposed convention, the lack of the commission did not rise to a constitutional violation.

This waiver had been used in the past to keep otherwise non-compliant vehicles in service. Plaintiffs argued that the rule negatively impacted them because the new rule might cause the retirement of some older vehicles and could result in additional costs. The court held that a plaintiff seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the validity or applicability of any rule promulgated by an administrative agency had to show that the rule, or its threatened application, interfered with or impaired, or threatened to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiff, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-7. The court held plaintiffs failed to present any credible evidence or assert any way in which the new rules would interfere or impair their legal rights or privileges. Plaintiffs did not allege any imminent or actual damage. For instance, plaintiffs did not allege that any of their taxicabs were in such poor condition that they could not qualify for an exemption from the requirements of the new regulations.</SPAN></P>

The government had an interest in ensuring that the information was not inadvertently released. The statute allowed limited discovery of a patient's confidential information.

In this action challenging the city's decision to increase the value of another parcel of land which the corporation owned from $ 30 per square foot to $ 75 per square foot, the trial court held that the property was neither &quot;omitted&quot; nor &quot;erroneously assessed&quot; under the law and that the city had violated R.I.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island, acting for plaintiff State, filed a complaint against several lead pigment manufacturers and their trade association, specifically nine named defendants. In its complaint, plaintiff alleged an extensive history of defendants' conduct consisting of misrepresentations and concealment of evidence regarding the hazards of lead. Defendants, either individually or in joining other defendants, filed motions to dismiss pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state any cause of action cognizable under Rhode Island law. The trial court found that defendants' motions to dismiss had to be examined in the context of the powers of the attorney general to redress public wrongs. Further, to adopt the free public services rule and dismiss this action thereby, particularly in the absence of controlling caselaw requiring such a rule, would have ignored existing authority of the attorney general. Finally, the trial court found that the attorney general pled sufficient factual allegations to withstand the defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal government of a Rhode Island town enacted an anti-smoking ordinance that permitted smoking only in enclosed areas of restaurants and in bars, where children were not allowed, and provided for enforcement by suspending or revoking victualing and liquor licenses. The court held, first, that the ordinance was within the home rule powers of the municipality pursuant to R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4. It then held that the state statutes authorizing municipalities to license restaurants and establishments selling alcohol contained broad enough delegations of power to exercise the licensing power in the public interest to empower the municipality to enact the challenged ordinance. Finally, although various Rhode Island statutes regulated public smoking, the statutes did not evidence a legislative intent to preempt the field. A restaurant or bar could comply with the local ordinance without violating any state statute.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motions, holding that the DNA evidence which plaintiff sought to introduce at trial did not require an evidentiary hearing, and that it was sound, reliable, directly related to the trial issues. The court further held that defendant was not in custody when he made the statements to police, and, thus, Miranda warnings were not required at that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' applications for permits to carry concealed weapons were denied by defendant state officials. They challenged the action as a denial of due process rights guaranteed by the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act and their right to bear arms, guaranteed most particularly by R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The court, a superior court, held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, although plaintiffs could seek relief in the state's high court. Judicial review in a court of general jurisdiction was only available in a contested proceeding, and under a statute that gave defendants broad discretion, as R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-47-18 (1956), the licensing statute, did, there was no right to a hearing, no contested proceeding, and no judicial review. The court also noted that there was no infringement of the right to bear arms, because case law upheld statutes forbidding carrying a weapon outside one's home, land, or business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion. It lacked subject matter jurisdiction because a license application process was not a contested proceeding entitling plaintiffs to judicial review.

The jury found against one defendant police officer but in favor of defendant town and two other officers. The plaintiff also moved for a new trial as to the negligence and excessive force claims against remaining defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that she sustained injuries as a result of the defendant police officers' (defendants one, two and three) negligence and use of excessive force, and filed suit against the officers and defendant town. A jury found in favor of the plaintiff on her negligence claim against a defendant one. The jury returned verdicts in favor of remaining defendants two and three, and defendant town on all claims, and in favor of defendant one on the plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. Plaintiff moved for an additur, or alternatively, a new trial. The trial court found that the amount awarded by the jury was too low given the nature of plaintiff's injuries. As to the motion for new trial, the trial court found that, in terms of plaintiff's objections to juror conduct, it appeared from the plaintiff's actions that she was satisfied with the jurors' voir dire and did not think that she had been prejudiced. Therefore, it would have been unfair to set aside the jury verdict to allow the plaintiff to argue prejudice. The court found that plaintiff's other claims were without merit. As such, the jury award was increased, and plaintiff's other motions were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's motion for additur was granted because if the award were allowed to stand, it would have failed to do substantial justice. However, if defendant one did not agree to such additur, then plaintiff's motion for a new trial on the issue of damages alone against defendant one alone was granted. Plaintiff's motion to recover costs was granted. All other motions filed by the plaintiff or any of the defendants were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants for medical malpractice. Plaintiffs filed a R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-2-19 motion requesting that the matter be given priority for expedited hearing. Defendant doctor argued that the motion was premature, and that the statute violated provision of the state and U.S. constitutions. R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-2-19 provided that if recoverable damages in a medical malpractice action were likely to exceed $ 100,000.00, then the action was entitled to expedited hearing. However, the statute provided that it was not to be construed so as to preclude adequate time for reasonable discovery. The court held plaintiffs' damages, if liability were proved, were likely to exceed $ 100,000. The court held the motion was not premature. The court held the statute did not violate the purchase clause of the Rhode Island constitution, as there was no showing that the statute either benefited the court or procured its favor to any party. The court held defendant's equal protection rights were not violated. The court held the statute did not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect classification, and the statute was rationally related to a legitimate legislative concern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded case to trial court with direction for trial court to determine whether R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 34, ch. 36.1, entitled &quot;Condominium Law,&quot; (1982 Act) was unconstitutional delegation of judicial or police power to condominium association. Trial court also addressed whether plaintiff could recover money paid to prevent foreclosure and whether plaintiff could recover attorney fees under &sect; 4.17 of the 1982 Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 34, ch. 36.1, entitled &quot;Condominium Law,&quot; (1982 Act) was an unconstitutional delegation of police or judicial power to a private entity. Plaintiff succeeded in his challenge of the defendants' conduct due to the unconstitutional nature of the 1982 Act , not because defendants violated the 1982 Act. Plaintiff signed the original settlement agreement without indicating he was signing under protest. The court had previously determined that plaintiff did not sign under duress. Since defendant had an apparent right to take the threatened action at the time it was threatened, and it was not until a future threat of foreclosure that plaintiff chose to litigate, plaintiff was not entitled to a refund of the initial settlement. Although the court found that certain provisions of the 1982 Act were unconstitutional, the court did not find that defendants' previous reliance on it was unreasonable. Accordingly, the court did not award counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute permitting foreclosure by a condominium association due to nonpayment of fees and assessments was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial or police power. Plaintiff was therefore granted an injunction preventing foreclosure of his condominiums. Plaintiff was not entitled to a refund funds he paid to avoid foreclosure. He was not entitled to attorney fees since defendants did not violate the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state retirement board moved for a stay of the ordered return of defendant public official's $ 42,067 contribution to his pension fund, and defendant and party in interest wife moved for a new trial in plaintiff's action under the Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act after defendant had pled guilty to criminal actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant public official pled guilty to taking bribes as governor. Plaintiff state retirement board sought, under the Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act, and was granted revocation of defendant's pension for at least 17 and a half years that he served. The court affirmed and denied defendant's and party in interest wife's motions for a new trial. The parties agreed that plaintiff could hold, pending appeal, defendant's $ 42,067 pension contribution that had been ordered returned. If the Supreme Court affirmed the return order, plaintiff, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-21-10, would have to pay defendant post-judgment interest. Party in interest had not been an indispensable party to plaintiff's action, thus the trial court properly denied defendant dismissal of the action. Defendant's plea agreement had spoken to forfeiture, not revocation, thus defendant showed no evidence that the attorney general promised his pension would not be revoked. The Act was not a criminal statute and its application to defendant had not been an ex post fact violation. Party in interest failed to show that she was in financial need of defendant's pension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New trial motions were denied. Parties agreed that plaintiff, pending appeal, should hold defendant's pension contribution that had been ordered returned. Defendant's plea agreement in earlier criminal trial had barred forfeiture, not revocation; revocation act was not an ex post facto violation; prosecutorial misconduct paled before defendant's criminality; and party in interest failed to show financial need.</SPAN></P>
