<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neglect action against respondent mother by petitioner County Department of Social Services; the issue was raised as to whether placement should be with the father or a different dispositional alternative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon the mother's voluntary admissions, the court found that the child was in fact a neglected child as that term was defined by Family Ct Act &sect; 1012 and that the mother was the person responsible for the neglect. Subsequently, a dispositional hearing was held and the issue was raised regarding placing the child with his father, who had not been named as a respondent. The court found, inter alia, that the father had had extremely limited (if any) contact with the child. Because the child had never resided in the father's home, an order of disposition placing the child with someone other than the father would not be an order removing the child from his father's home. In addition, there were no limitations in Family Ct Act &sect;&sect; 1027(b)(i), 1052, 1055 that prohibited placement of the child with someone other than the father. Accordingly, the court concluded that it had options under Family Ct Act &sect; 1035(d)(ii) to determine the child's placement. Although the cases were distinguished, the court respectfully suggested that the limitations imposed by Telsa Z., be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where respondent mother had been found to have neglected her son in a child protective proceeding without any similar finding of neglect having been made against the biological father, who did not reside with respondent and their child and had only extremely limited contact with the child, Family Court was not obligated to place the child with the nonrespondent father if it determined that it was in the best interest of the child to select a different dispositional alternative pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 1052. Since the child never resided with the nonrespondent father, an order of disposition placing the child with the Commissioner of the local Department of Social Services or someone other than the father would not be an order removing the child from his father's home and thus would not violate the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Telsa Z. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(Rickey Z.--Denise Z.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (71 AD3d 1246, 897 NYS2d 281). The limitations on placement imposed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Telsa Z</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. where the neglected child resides in the home of a nonrespondent parent should be reconsidered to allow the Family Court, after making a finding that a child has been neglected or abused upon a full fact-finding hearing, to issue any statutorily authorized dispositional order that serves the best interest of the child. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, city human resources administration (HRA) and Office of Temporary Disability and Assistance (OTDA), filed motions to dismiss petitioner mother's CPLR art. 78 petition--regarding their decisions as to her eligibility to receive child care services--for lack of ripeness and failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After HRA denied the mother's application for benefits, OTDA found that she was eligible for benefits. The gravamen of the mother's petition was that 18 NYCRR 385.4(a)(1)(ii) conflicted with Social Services Law &sect;&sect; 330 and 332-a. The court found, inter alia, that the purported conflict between the regulation and the statutes did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that they were inconsistent or that the mother would be entitled to child care benefits. The ODTA was entitled to an opportunity to interpret the regulation and determine if it could be reconciled with the statutes. Accordingly, because the mother failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, she was not entitled to art. 78 relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motions were granted, the petition was denied, and the proceeding was dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CPLR article 78 proceeding commenced by petitioner, a public assistance recipient with three minor children and a health-related disability, challenging the determination of respondent New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) to terminate her child care benefits while she was enrolled as a student in a licensed practical nursing program because she was not engaged in a work-related activity was dismissed due to petitioner's failure to exhaust available administrative remedies before the New York State Office of Temporary Disability and Assistance (OTDA). HRA's determination followed OTDA's fair hearing decision in petitioner's favor which ruled that HRA's initial determination to terminate petitioner's child care benefits was &quot;not correct,&quot; and directed HRA to provide petitioner with those benefits &quot;if so eligible.&quot; Under these circumstances, although petitioner was not required to seek another fair hearing to review HRA's determination, petitioner should have filed a complaint with the Commissioner of OTDA pursuant to 18 NYCRR 358-6.4 (c) challenging the adequacy of HRA's compliance with the fair hearing decision before seeking judicial intervention. OTDA's expertise was required to determine whether the regulation relied upon by HRA in terminating petitioner's child care benefits (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">18 NYCRR 385.4 [a] [1] [ii]) conflicted with Social Services Law &sect;332-a. Furthermore, there was no evidence that filing a complaint with the Commissioner of OTDA would be futile. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate challenged a determination by defendant state board of elections that voided his nominating petitions pursuant to Election Law &sect; 16-102 for insufficient signatures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate submitted a petition for the independent nomination for the Tea Party for the office of the New York State Senate. The court found, inter alia, that the effect of removing the phrase &quot;who also is qualified to sign the petition&quot; from Election Law &sect; 6-140(1)(b) was to remove the only basis for the requirement that a witness not have signed an earlier, valid petition. The only requirement remaining for a witness to a nominating petition was to be a duly qualified voter of the state. Therefore, after restoring the erroneously voided signatures, the nominating petition contained signatures in excess of the number required by &sect; 16-102. Consequently, the candidate's name was to be restored to the ballot for the office he sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The determination was reversed, and the candidate's name was restored to the ballot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Nominating Petitions -- Qualification of Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Board of Elections improperly invalidated signatures on a nominating petition on the ground that the witnesses had previously signed a designating petition for the same office. The effect of the Legislature removing the phrase &quot;who also is qualified to sign the petition&quot; from Election Law &sect;6-140 (1) (b) was to remove the only basis for the requirement that a witness not have signed an earlier, valid petition. It is clear that the only requirement now for a witness to a nominating petition is to be a duly qualified voter of the state. To require more is to attempt to regraft requirements from a phrase that is no longer part of the applicable statute. There are anomalies in the statute, but to continue a restriction without a basis would do violence to the plain meaning of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Nominating Petitions -- Residence of Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Signatures on a nominating petition witnessed by two people were improperly voided by the Board of Elections on the ground that the address given on their sheets was different from the address in the voting records. They lived in the same house, but the county had changed the address to facilitate 911 responses, which resulted in their residence having two addresses. They still received mail from the county Board of Elections at their new address. This was not a case where a witness had moved. Therefore, they had provided the correct address of their residence on the nominating petition and the signatures they witnessed should not have been stricken.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Nominating Petitions -- Residence of Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Signatures on a nominating petition witnessed by a person who had married and moved into his new address in late November of 2009, but witnessed the signatures at issue in mid-August 2010 and used his new address, which was different from his old address, were properly stricken. The witness was not in the process of moving from one address to another during the signature-gathering period, and the concerns of rapid and efficient verification of signatures within the restrictive time periods imposed by the Election Law and facilitating the discovery of fraud were raised by the discrepancy in his addresses. </SPAN></P>

The family court found, inter alia, that while the petition as a whole contained non-hearsay factual allegations that, if true, established the commission of the crime of first-degree robbery, a juvenile offense, the presentment agency only charged the juvenile with an attempt to commit that crime, which was not a juvenile offense. Accordingly, pursuant to &sect; 315.1(1)(b), dismissal of the petition was required for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- Lack of Original Jurisdiction Over Acts for Which Juvenile Subject to Criminal Prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Court lacked original subject matter jurisdiction over a juvenile delinquency petition charging the 14-year-old respondent with committing acts constituting the crimes of attempted robbery in the first degree and other completed offenses since the nonhearsay factual allegations, if true, established that respondent committed acts constituting the completed crime of robbery in the first degree. Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile delinquent, who, by definition, is a person over 7 and less than 16 years of age and who, having committed acts that would constitute a crime if committed by an adult, is not criminally responsible for such conduct by reason of infancy or is the defendant in an action ordered removed from a criminal court pursuant to CPL article 725 (Family Ct Act &sect; 301.2 [1]). Juveniles between the ages of 13 and 15 who are charged with certain enumerated, serious crimes of violence are &quot;juvenile offenders.&quot; Juvenile offenders are excluded from the definition of juvenile delinquents and are deprived of the defense of infancy and subject to criminal prosecution for the commission of an enumerated crime. A 14 year old who is criminally responsible for acts constituting first-degree robbery is a juvenile offender. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 10.00 [18]; &sect; 30.00 [2]; CPL 1.20 [42].) To allow the presentment agency here to draft the accusatory instrument in order to evade limitations placed upon Family Court's jurisdiction would impermissibly permit a litigant to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a court which is not vested with original jurisdiction over the proceeding. Accordingly, the juvenile delinquency petition was dismissed as jurisdictionally defective (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Ct Act &sect; 315.1). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for an order dismissing the charge of criminal trespass that was filed against him as facially insufficient pursuant to CPL 170.30 (1) (a), 100.15 (3), and 100.40 (1) (a), and for other relief; defendant claimed that the count failed to make out lack of permission or authority to enter or remain, an element of all trespass offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant enter a subway station through the turnstiles and gates by using a student MetroCard that was issued for the exclusive use of another person. Defendant told the officer that he had borrowed his sister's card to take his girl to school. Defendant claimed that the subway area beyond the turnstiles was a public place because the transit authority was a public entity and therefore he had a right to be there unless he lawfully and personally had been ordered to leave. The court disagreed. While the subway system was publicly owned, offered as a public service, and was created to perform a governmental function, the transit authority required that a fare to use the subway system be paid at a turnstile. Consequently, the area beyond the turnstiles was not open to members of the public--unless they swiped a valid fare card to pass inside. Therefore, entry into the subway system beyond the turnstiles without paying the fare constituted third-degree criminal trespass under Penal Law &sect; 140.10. Consequently, he was not entitled to relief &sect;&sect; 170.30 (1) (a), 100.15 (3), and 100.40 (1) (a). However, he was entitled to Mapp/Dunaway and Huntley hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the trespass count was denied; Mapp/Dunaway and Huntley hearings were to be conducted, the motion to reserve the right to make further motions was denied, and the People's motion to compel limited reciprocal discovery was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Trespass -- Entering Subway System without Paying Required Fare </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant could lawfully be prosecuted for criminal trespass in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 140.10) based upon an accusatory instrument alleging that a police officer observed him enter a subway station beyond the turnstiles using a nontransferable student MetroCard belonging to another person. The statute proscribes knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 140.00 [5]) in a building or upon real property &quot;which is fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders.&quot; Although the subway system is publicly owned, the New York City Transit Authority is empowered to require that a fare be paid to use those facilities (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Authorities Law &sect; 1204 [5-a]). The presence of a turnstile inside a subway station makes the real property within &quot;fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude&quot; persons who have not paid a fare. The area beyond the turnstiles is not open to members of the public unless they swipe a valid fare card to pass inside. Consequently, entry into the subway system beyond the turnstiles without paying the required fare constitutes criminal trespass in the third degree, and the accusatory instrument was thus facially sufficient for pleading purposes. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with violating &sect; 20-453, for displaying and offering for sale condoms on the street without a general vendor license. The condoms contained written messages that tied safe sex with safe political practices. The court found, inter alia, that although the condoms communicated messages arguably designed to stimulate political awareness and conversation, the political references were used as a marketing device to boost sales. Accordingly, the condoms did not fall within the First Amendment exceptions to &sect; 20-453.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Street Sale of Message-Bearing Novelty Condoms without Vendor's License </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topical novelty condoms sold in message-bearing wrappers with the names and images of well-known political figures were not expressive items entitled to First Amendment protection so as to exempt street vendors of those items from New York City's general vendor licensing statute (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-453). The products at issue do not fall within the statute's&nbsp;First Amendment exemptions from the licensing requirement for vendors of written materials such as newspapers and books and &quot;other similar written matter,&quot; as well as vendors of various nonwritten objects such as paintings, photographs, prints and sculptures. Defendants' merchandise had a dominant nonexpressive purpose, with political references being used merely as a marketing device to boost sales rather than to promote any ideas or viewpoints. As such, the items were &quot;commercial goods&quot; that fell outside the scope of the First Amendment. Furthermore, the licensing statute, as applied, constituted a valid &quot;time, place or manner&quot; restriction on expression that was narrowly tailored to serve the significant governmental interest in keeping the public streets free of congestion and maintaining the City's tax base and economic viability. The statute provided defendants with ample alternative channels of communication aside from unlicensed street sales. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant owner filed a CPL 170.40 application for an order dismissing two notices of liability in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner received two notices that he was liable to pay fines of $ 50 after the driver of his vehicle did not stop at red lights. The court found, inter alia, that it lacked jurisdiction to issue a declaration regarding the legality of the current system for appointing judicial hearing officers to the Traffic and Parking Violations Agency. The court was aware of no legal requirement, and the owner cited none, that motorists be warned that a particular intersection was watched by a &quot;red light camera&quot; or that the owner be supplied with a sworn or affirmed certificate by a technician to serve as prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. the owner's claims, regarding the time the yellow light lasted or that the light otherwise malfunctioned, were defenses more properly raised at the hearing on the merits. Inasmuch as the owner did not face a criminal conviction or conviction under the Vehicle and Traffic Law, his due process violation claim lacked merit. Since a notice of liability was not an accusatory instrument, the ultimate relief the owner sought was not available under &sect; 170.40. the owner's remaining contentions were considered and found to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was not entitled to dismissal, in the interests of justice on a motion made pursuant to CPL 170.40 to the president of the Board of the Judges of the District Court of Nassau County (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UDCA 2406), of two notices of liability sent by mail by the &quot;Red Light Camera Division&quot; of the Nassau County Parking and Traffic Violations Agency advising him that his vehicle was recorded passing a red light by an authorized red light camera (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1111-b; Local Law No. 12-2009 of County of Nassau). The extraordinary relief of dismissal in the interests of justice is available only in criminal cases commenced by the filing of an accusatory instrument (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 170.30 [1] [g]). Since a notice of liability is not an accusatory instrument, the ultimate relief sought by defendant was not available. Furthermore, the court lacked jurisdiction to issue a declaratory ruling on defendant's claims regarding the validity of the red light camera program and the alleged improper appointment of judicial hearing officers to conduct hearings under the program. Defendant's remaining constitutional claims regarding the program lacked merit. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff association sought a judgment declaring that Tax Law &sect; 32 was unconstitutional and that defendant department was not allowed to not require enrolled agents or their employees to register with the department or to pay any fees pursuant to &sect; 32. The department moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action and sought a judgment declaring that &sect; 32 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association claimed that &sect; 32 was pre-empted with respect to enrolled agents by federal licensing requirements. However, the court found that the complaint did not plead facts that supported a claim that Congress intended federal law to fully occupy the field of tax return preparation. The Practice Regulations of 31 C.F.R. &sect; 10.1 et seq. did not contain language suggesting that they were intended to exclusively regulate the preparation of both federal and state tax returns. The association also alleged due process and equal protection violations, but failed to plead any facts to support its assertion that there was not a reasonable connection between &sect; 32's registration requirement and the promotion of public welfare. Nor did the association's allegations support a claim that &sect; 32's exemption of tax attorneys and accountants was arbitrary and capricious. There was a reasonably conceivable state of facts providing a rational basis to sustain the classification. The imposition of an obligation to pay money did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property, and a reasonable user fee is not a taking if imposed for the reimbursement of the cost of government services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department's motion to dismiss was granted. It was ordered, adjudged, and declared that Tax Law &sect; 32 did not violate the United States Constitution by requiring enrolled agents and their employees to register with the  New York Department of Taxation and Finance and to pay fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Federal Preemption -- Registration of Tax Return Preparers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tax Law &sect; 32, which requires commercial preparers of New York State tax returns, excluding only attorneys, public accountants and certified public accountants, to register electronically with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) for each calendar year and to pay an annual $ 100 fee to DTF as part of an effort to enhance the quality of tax preparation services in New York, is not unconstitutional as applied to agents enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service and their employees on the ground of preemption by federal licensing requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;31 CFR 10.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.). Congress did not intend federal law to fully occupy the field of tax return preparation. Rather, Congress expressly recognized the existence of parallel state licensing and regulation of state tax return preparers (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;26 USC &sect; 6103 [k] [5]). Moreover, the fact that preparation of a New York State tax return may be &quot;inextricably&quot; linked to an enrolled agent's preparation of federal tax returns is insufficient to demonstrate either field or conflict preemption.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Registration of Tax Return Preparers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Tax Law &sect; 32, which requires commercial preparers of New York State tax returns, excluding only attorneys, public accountants and certified public accountants, to register electronically with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) for each calendar year and to pay an annual $ 100 fee to DTF as part of an effort to enhance the quality of tax preparation services in New York, is not violative of due process or equal protection as applied to agents enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate the absence of a reasonable connection between the statute's registration requirement and the promotion of the public welfare, especially in view of the recent acknowledged unethical and criminal behavior in the tax return preparer community. Furthermore, the classification of enrolled agents as being nonexempt from the statute's licensing requirement is not arbitrary and capricious. Enrolled agents, although subject to standards of practice under the federal practice regulations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">31 CFR 10.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), are not subject to the same licensing and professional standards as are attorneys and certified public accountants. Furthermore, Tax Law &sect; 32 is not arbitrary for serving the same purpose as General Business Law &sect; 372. That statute, which provides for a &quot;consumer bill of rights&quot; regarding tax preparers, predates the enactment of Tax Law &sect; 32 and does not prescribe any registration requirements for tax return preparers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Registration of Tax Return Preparers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Tax Law &sect; 32, which requires commercial preparers of New York State tax returns, excluding only attorneys, public accountants and certified public accountants, to register electronically with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) for each calendar year and to pay an annual $ 100 fee to DTF as part of an effort to enhance the quality of tax preparation services in New York, does not represent an unconstitutional taking of property as applied to agents enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service. A reasonable user fee is not a taking if it is imposed for the reimbursement of the cost of government services. Here, the annual fee is a reasonable amount for administration of the registration program, and is comparable to the registration fees that both attorneys and certified public accountants registered in New York are required to pay. Moreover, the increased confidence in the tax preparation industry resulting from the enhanced regulation confers a benefit on both enrolled agents and the general public. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several crimes, including using a basement as a dwelling unit, improper storage and collection of garbage, and expired building permit. Defendant brought an omnibus motion requesting, among other things, discovery and inspection of evidence, an order directing the prosecution to file and serve a bill of particulars, suppression of evidence, and dismissal of the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution argued that disclosure under CPL 240.20 only directed that discovery be provided to defendants charged with felonies or misdemeanors. However, the court interpreted CPL 240.20 as requiring the prosecution to provide discovery to defendants who were also charged under an information not charging a misdemeanor. Based on review of defendant's request for a bill of particulars, several of the requests were reasonable. The indictments for two of the charges were insufficient. The attorney's affirmation submitted in support of defendant's motion to suppress lacked sufficient factual information to permit the court to grant this part of the motion. The assertions seeking to suppress &quot;observations&quot; was too broad and conclusory to raise any factual issues to support suppression under CPL 710.60. However, Hempstead, N.Y., Village Code &sect; 52-2A (7) was unconstitutional. The fact that two cars were parked at a home and were registered to persons with two different surnames, should not have automatically led to the assumption that two families were living in that dwelling. Under the color of this law, there was no probable cause to issue a warrant under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion for discovery was granted. Defendant's request for a bill of particulars was also granted. The warrant was suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Property Owner Entitled to Disclosure in Criminal Prosecution for Violations of Village Code Charged in Information </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was entitled to disclosure in a criminal prosecution for numerous violations of a village code, none of which comprised a felony or misdemeanor. CPL 240.20, which requires the prosecution to provide disclosure to a defendant against whom an &quot;indictment, superior court information, prosecutor's information, information, or simplified information charging a misdemeanor is pending,&quot; does not limit disclosure to only those defendants charged with felonies or misdemeanors. Rather, the statute requires the prosecution to provide discovery to defendants who are also charged under an information that does not charge a misdemeanor, as here. The misdemeanor requirement only applies to a simplified information, which is distinct from an ordinary information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Bill of Particulars </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's request for a bill of particulars pursuant to CPL 200.95 was granted in view of the prosecutor's failure to provide the grounds for the refusal to comply with defendant's otherwise facially reasonable requests for information. The prosecution's refusal to comply with a request for a bill of particulars must be in writing setting forth the grounds for the belief that the item of factual information requested is not authorized to be included or that such information is not necessary for the defendant to adequately prepare or conduct a defense, and must be timely served on the defendant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Information -- Sufficiency of Accusatory Instruments Charging Property Owner with Violations of Village Code </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accusatory instruments charging defendant, the owner of a building occupied by tenants, with violations of the village code for using a basement as a dwelling unit, permitting three unrelated occupants to use the residence as living and sleeping quarters, improperly storing and collecting garbage, and permitting garbage and debris to be unlawfully placed for collection were facially sufficient (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 100.15, 100.40 [1] [a]) to withstand defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to CPL 170.30 and 170.35. The charges were all based on the personal observations of the village code enforcement officer. The charge of failing to maintain a fence in safe condition was dismissed for facial insufficiency since the accusatory instrument merely alleged that the fence was not functional and did not allege that the fence was unsafe. Similarly, the charge that defendant continued to work on an abandoned project with an expired building permit was likewise dismissed for facial insufficiency, since the accusatory instrument did not allege factually that defendant continued working on the project after the project had been deemed abandoned. Lastly, the charge that defendant failed to provide an emergency escape and rescue opening for a &quot;finished basement&quot; in violation of the code provision requiring that basements with &quot;habitable space&quot; have an opening for emergency escape and rescue was facially sufficient. A &quot;finished basement&quot; as alleged in the accusatory instrument is the same as having &quot;habitable space.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Standing -- Standing of Limited Liability Company Property Owner to Seek Suppression of Evidence in Prosecution for Violations of Village Code </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a criminal prosecution for violations of a village code involving a building owned by defendant limited liability company and occupied by tenants, defendant had standing to seek suppression of the personal observations of the village code enforcement officer that formed the basis for the charges against it since it had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the searched premises. The protections of the Fourth Amendment apply to entities such as defendant. The violations charged against defendant could ultimately result in fines, penalties and liens imposed against the property. Those pecuniary interests demonstrated a direct proprietary interest in the property sufficient to vest defendant with standing to suppress the evidence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Suppression Hearing -- Suppression Motion Summarily Denied Due to Lack of Specificity </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a criminal prosecution for violations of a village code, a motion by defendant seeking suppression of the personal observations of the village code enforcement officer that formed the basis for the charges against it was summarily denied pursuant to CPL 710.60. The attorney's affirmation submitted in support of the suppression motion lacked sufficient specificity to support the assertion that the code enforcement officer's observations should be suppressed. The affirmation failed to specify facts such as which observations defendant was seeking to suppress or any other facts upon which the court could review the application. The assertions seeking to suppress &quot;observations&quot; were too broad and conclusory to raise any factual issues to support a ruling in favor of suppression.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption in Village Code That Two Families are Illegally Residing in Dwelling if Two Cars Registered to Persons with Different Surnames are Parked at Residence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A village code provision that presumes &quot;two or more families are residing in the dwelling&quot; in violation of the law &quot;if there are two or more motor vehicles parked on the dwelling lot registered to persons with two or more different surnames&quot; is unconstitutional. The provision lacks a rational connection between the basic facts that the prosecution can prove and the ultimate fact presumed. There must be an additional condition that exists before that presumption can be made. The fact that two cars are parked at a residence and are registered to persons with two different surnames should not automatically lead to the assumption that two families are residing in that dwelling. A person with visitors to the home or a married couple with different surnames and vehicles registered under their own names would be presumed to be in violation of the law. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several drug possession and other violations. Before proceeding with a plea, the parties sought a determination regarding whether defendant had a predicate felony conviction pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.06 which might have had a significant impact on any sentence which would be promised pursuant to an agreed-upon plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the time which defendant previously spent in detention by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) constituted &quot;incarceration&quot; which served to toll the running of the &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(iv), (v), 10-year period within which a person must have been convicted of a prior felony in order to be deemed a predicate felony offender. If such detention was &quot;incarceration&quot; under the statute, defendant would likely have been adjudicated as a predicate felony offender. Defendant's ICE detention began in 1989 following his incarceration for a drug possession conviction and continued until July 13, 2000. The instant crimes were alleged to have occurred on or about March 27, 2009. The court found that the statute's language, surrounding provisions, legislative history, and case law interpretations all strongly indicated that incarceration should not have been construed to include immigration detention such as defendant was subject to. &quot;Incarceration&quot; under the statute did not include periods during which an offender was detained by ICE for possible deportation. Thus, defendant appeared to be a first felony offender under the relevant provisions of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant was a first felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Felony Offender--10-Year Toll during Period of &quot;Incarceration&quot; Not Applicable to Civil Immigration Detention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's period of detention in the custody of immigration authorities pending a determination of whether his 1990 felony narcotics conviction made him subject to deportation did not constitute &quot;incarceration&quot; which served to toll the running of the 10-year period within which a person must have been convicted of a prior felony in order to be deemed a predicate felony offender (Penal Law &sect; 70.06 [1] [b] [iv], [v]). Under the statutory scheme, the 10-year tolling period is measured from the date of a previously imposed criminal sentence, rather than a previous period of confinement for any other reason, thereby indicating the legislative intent that the tolling provision would apply only to imprisonment as punishment for a criminal conviction or adjudication and not some other type of involuntary confinement. Periods of time spent in civil immigration detention are not &quot;prison terms.&quot; Moreover, since defendant was not confined by a &quot;state or local incarcerating agency,&quot; it would be impossible for the predicate felony statement filed by the People to be in compliance with the literal terms of CPL 400.21. Consequently, defendant would only be deemed a first felony offender for purposes of sentencing pursuant to an agreed-upon plea to resolve the current charges against him. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff credit union's declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 253, which imposed a mortgage recording tax (MRT) on mortgages given to secure loans that it made to its members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After DTF's audit division issued an initial informal determination denying the credit union's requested refund, the credit union filed a declaratory judgment action, claiming that it was immune from state and local taxation under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1768 of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 and the Supremacy Clause. The court found, inter alia, that the credit union's challenge to the constitutionality of the MRT and DRT's power was enough to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Finally, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction was not applicable. However, notwithstanding the United States Supreme Court decisions on the issue, the New York Court of Appeals expressly held that the MRT was not a tax on property. Consequently, the court was constrained to follow the existing Court of Appeals authority on the issue and find that the MRT was not a tax on property and, therefore, not an exempted tax under the FCUA. As a result, the credit union failed to state an actionable claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Challenge to Legality of Imposition of Mortgage Recording Tax on Federal Credit Unions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiff federal credit union was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies before bringing a declaratory judgment action challenging the legality of the imposition of the mortgage recording tax (MRT) (Tax Law &sect; 253) on mortgages given to secure loans it makes to its members on the ground that federal credit unions are exempt from virtually all state and local taxation, including taxation on intangible property such as mortgages, under the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 (12 USC &sect; 1768). The fact that plaintiff's administrative appeal of the denial of its claim for a refund of the MRT it already paid was still pending did not foreclose plaintiff from bringing the action. Since plaintiff raised issues of constitutional interpretation and statutory construction, the action fell within an exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. There were no issues that required factual determination at the administrative level before the statutory and constitutional issues could be reached. Moreover, the administrative action sought redress for MRT already paid, while the declaratory judgment action sought prospective relief from having to pay the MRT in the future.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction -- Challenge to Legality of Imposition of Mortgage Recording Tax on Federal Credit Unions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiff federal credit union was not precluded by the primary jurisdiction doctrine from bringing a declaratory judgment action challenging the legality of the imposition of the mortgage recording tax (MRT) (Tax Law &sect; 253) on mortgages given to secure loans it makes to its members on the ground that federal credit unions are exempt from virtually all state and local taxation, including taxation on intangible property such as mortgages, under the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 (12 USC &sect; 1768). Since the only issues for consideration in the declaratory action were the applicability and/or constitutionality of the MRT as it applied to federal credit unions, the Department of Taxation and Finance did not have primary jurisdiction over those issues and the court was thus not required to defer to the expertise of the administrative agency.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law - Supremacy Clause - Challenge to Legality of Imposition of Mortgage Recording Tax on Federal Credit Unions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Federal credit unions such as plaintiff are not exempt under the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 (FCUA) (12 USC &sect; 1768) from paying the mortgage recording tax (MRT) (Tax Law &sect; 253) on mortgages given to secure loans made to their members. FCUA generally exempts the &quot;property&quot; of federal credit unions from local taxation. However, under New York law, the MRT is not a direct tax imposed on &quot;property,&quot; but is merely a tax on the privilege to record a mortgage. Furthermore, even if federal credit unions are considered to be instrumentalities of the federal government, they are still not entitled to immunity from the MRT. An instrumentality of the United States enjoys no greater immunity from taxation under the Supremacy Clause (US Const, art VI, cl 2) than what is provided for in the express applicable statutory provisions. Here, the MRT, as a tax on the privilege of recording a mortgage, was not expressly prohibited under any statutory immunity. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery, Penal Law &sect; 160.15(4), a class B violent felony. The People filed a statement of two or more predicate violent felony convictions, pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.08, and CPL 400.16, 400.15. The People argued that defendant had to be sentenced as a persistent violent felony offender (PVFO). The court sentenced defendant as a PVFO.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained he was not subject to the enhanced sentencing provisions of &sect; 70.08 because he was not the same person convicted of the two prior violent felonies set forth in the People's violent predicate felony offender statement. The People filed and served a certificate signed by an identification specialist employed by the state of New York Division of Criminal Justice Services within the Office of Criminal Justice Operations. The specialist compared the fingerprint card from the arrest under this indictment with the arrest fingerprint cards on file for the two prior felonies, and concluded the three sets of fingerprint impressions belonged to the same individual. The court found that this testimony, in conjunction with the two certificates of conviction and the three fingerprint cards admitted into evidence at the hearing, established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was the same person previously convicted of the two violent felonies set forth in the People's PVFO statement. There was no doubt that Penal Law &sect; 70.08 met the test for constitutionality under Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant was a mandatory PVFO.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was lawfully subjected to enhanced sentencing as a mandatory persistent violent felony offender (Penal Law &sect; 70.08) based upon the People's predicate felony statement (CPL 400.16) indicating that defendant had two prior qualifying violent felony convictions for robbery in the second degree. Defendant failed to controvert the predicate statement on the ground that he was not the same person who was convicted of the two prior violent felonies. The People satisfied their burden of proving that defendant was in fact the same person who was convicted of the prior crimes through the submission of the certificates of conviction in conjunction with a fingerprint comparison certificate (CPL 60.60). Moreover, although the testimony of a live witness was not required to establish defendant's identity as the person named in the two certificates of conviction, the People's expert in fingerprint analysis testified in any event that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, all three fingerprint records belonged to the same individual.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The PVFO statute meets the test for constitutionality since the enhanced sentencing ranges under the statute are activated without the court's discretion based solely on the finding of two or more prior violent felony convictions. Prior convictions may be used to enhance a defendant's sentencing and need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before a jury. Consequently, defendant was not entitled to have a jury determine his PVFO status. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner trustee sought appointment as an SCPA art. 17-A guardian for a disabled person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the reports of health care providers, the ward was described as suffering from profound mental retardation and autism. At issue was whether constitutional standards required periodic reporting and review in an art. 17-A proceeding. The court found that they did. As a matter of fundamental due process, the state was not allowed to impose the loss of personal liberty inherent in a guardianship without some guarantee that the person to whom it granted guardianship continued to act in her ward's best interests, and that the ward was, at the very least, no worse off than before the guardianship was awarded. A court granting guardianship of the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled had to require periodic reporting and review-or &quot;monitoring&quot;-by art. 17-A guardians of the person, even as it did, by statute, of guardians of the property. This monitoring requirement was inherent not only in the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process of law, but also under the international human rights norms contained in the Convention and Optional Protocol on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was in the ward's best interest that the trustee be appointed his guardian. The trustee was ordered to report to the court, on a yearly basis, providing such information as was required by Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 81.31 for persons adjudicated incapacitated and appointed guardians under Mental Hygiene Law art. 81.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Incapacitated and Mentally Disabled Persons -- Guardian for Mentally Retarded and Developmentally Disabled Persons -- Periodic Reporting and Review Requirement &quot;Read Into&quot; Statutory Scheme to Satisfy Constitutional Standards </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding pursuant to SCPA article 17-A for the appointment of a guardian for a person suffering from mental retardation and developmental disabilities, it was determined that, in order to satisfy constitutional standards and international human rights concerns, a requirement of periodic reporting and review must be &quot;read into&quot; the statute. Under the present statutory scheme, once the guardian has been appointed, the court's involvement ends without any subsequent reporting or review. However, as a matter of fundamental due process, the State may not impose the extensive loss of personal liberty inherent in the guardianship system without some guarantee that the person or persons to whom it has granted guardianship of the person continues to act in the ward's best interests. A periodic reporting and review requirement would enable the Surrogate's Court to ascertain whether the deprivation of liberty resulting from guardianship is still justified by the ward's disabilities. In the absence of periodic reporting and review, the risk of deprivation of protected liberty interests is great, while imposing an annual reporting requirement would substantially increase the likelihood that guardianship is still needed in the best interests of the ward. In the absence of such reporting, there is virtually no other way for the court to stay apprised of the ward's situation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners of adult bookstores, video stores, and movie theaters brought an action against defendant city, and others, attacking the constitutionality of NY City Zoning Resolution &sect; 12-10 and asking for a preliminary injunction. Initially, the court granted the injunction. On appeal, however, the order was reversed and the reversal was then modified. The case was remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prior ordinance was applied less restrictively to owners who devoted less than 40 percent of their floor space to adult activities, known as the 60/40 formula. The city believed that the 60/40 formula resulted in sham compliance, and amendments to &sect; 12-10 sought to broaden the definition of adult establishment use. The owners argued that the city had failed to make out a prima facie case because it failed to submit any evidence that any of the institutions that the city put forth as 60/40 entities were, in fact, 60/40 entities. The court disagreed. The remand instruction was directed to self identified establishments. That was what all the businesses examined by the city were. The essential nature of the businesses as adult establishments had not changed and no new study had to be undertaken to determine whether 60/40 entities had a deleterious effect on their surrounding environs. The city provided substantial evidence that their dominant, ongoing focus was on adult matters and thus satisfied its &quot;light&quot; burden with regard to bookstores and video stores. However, the same holding did not apply to the two adult movie theaters in this action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the owners' request for relief with regards to the bookstores and video stores, but not as to the two adult movie theaters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 2001 amendments to New York City's adult use zoning regulations, which redefined and broadened the definition of &quot;adult establishment&quot; subject to regulation as to location, were constitutional as applied to plaintiffs' bookstores and video stores. Defendant City provided substantial evidence that the conversion of plaintiffs' totally adult entities to 60/40 adult establishments in order to comply with the adult zoning regulations was a sham because the dominant, ongoing focus of those establishments was on adult materials. Defendant thus met its light burden of showing that the essential nature of plaintiffs' adult establishments had not changed, and that it could thus rely on a prior study of the negative secondary effects of adult establishments in New York City to regulate otherwise constitutionally protected speech as to time, place and manner as a legitimate exercise of its police power. However, the amendments were not constitutional as applied to two adult movie theatres. The large number of peep shows in one theatre and the payment of one admission in both theatres, which allows a patron to see all of the movies, both adult and nonadult, did not constitute the necessary substantial evidence. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner brought a hybrid CPLR art. 78 proceeding against defendants city and New York City Department of Buildings (New York) (DOB), and others which, inter alia, challenged a declaration of immediate emergency relating to the owner's building and building violations and sought injunctive relief restraining further demolition of the building and enforcement of DOB actions. The city and the DOB moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the DOB's inspection of the building, it relied on the expertise of the Emergency Response Team and its weekend-duty engineer, who recommended that an immediate emergency be issued and that the building be demolished to a safe level. The court found that this was proper. The record reflected that the DOB followed necessary notice procedures for emergency demolition. The owner presented only evidence in the form of testimony by its engineer, whose statements that the building was structurally sound were based only on inspection after the top two floors had been demolished. A discrepancy in the professional opinions of the engineers alone did not invalidate the DOB's administrative determination. Absent a clear showing by the owner that the determination of the DOB was arbitrary and capricious or irrational, such determination should not have been disturbed. The evidence provided a rational basis for the DOB's determination that the building was in immediate danger of collapse. Given the exigent circumstances presented by the building's condition, the owner was not deprived of due process merely because it was not afforded any pre-deprivation notice or hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the petition/complaint for failure to state a claim and for lack of ripeness and jurisdiction was granted in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Unsafe Buildings -- Emergency Demolition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The determination of the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) declaring plaintiffs' five-story building to be in imminent danger of collapse and authorizing the immediate demolition of the top two floors of the building in order to reduce the building to a safe level was reasonable, rational and in compliance with law. DOB was entitled to rely on the expertise and experience of the emergency response team that inspected the building and its weekend-duty engineer, who recommended that an immediate emergency be issued. The fact plaintiffs' engineer gave a contrary professional opinion as to the condition of the building by itself was insufficient to invalidate DOB's administrative determination in the absence of a clear showing by plaintiffs that DOB's determination was arbitrary and capricious or in any way irrational. Moreover, the record demonstrated that DOB followed necessary notice procedures for emergency demolition (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY City Charter &sect; 643; Administrative Code of City of NY former &sect;&sect; 26-235, 26-243, 26-127). Under these circumstances, the affidavit of plaintiffs' engineer was insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact requiring a trial pursuant to CPLR 7804 (h). Issues such as whether the building was actually in imminent danger of collapse and whether demolition was the only appropriate remedy were discretionary determinations of DOB entitled to deference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Unsafe Buildings -- Emergency Demolition -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs failed to state any due process claims regarding the constitutional sufficiency of the notice used to apprise them of the rationally-based determination of the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) declaring their five-story building to be in imminent danger of collapse and authorizing the immediate demolition of the top two floors of the building in order to reduce the building to a safe level. The demolition of a building for the purpose of dealing with an emergency without a prior hearing does not give rise to a due process claim as long as there is a postdeprivation remedy. Here, given the exigent circumstances presented by the building's imminent danger of collapse, which necessitated prompt action by DOB, plaintiffs were not deprived of due process merely because they were not afforded any predeprivation notice or hearing. Rather, plaintiffs' opportunity to contest the propriety of the agency determination and seek money damages in a state court action provided them adequate postdeprivation remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Emergency Demolition of Unsafe Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs failed to state a claim to recover damages for an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; with respect to the rationally-based determination of the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) declaring their five-story building to be in imminent danger of collapse and authorizing the immediate demolition of the top two floors of the building in order to reduce the building to a safe level. The municipal demolition of an imminently dangerous structure in order to protect the public is an exercise of the police power and does not constitute a &quot;taking.&quot; Furthermore, the court was required to defer to DOB's discretion in determining that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and required emergency demolition, as supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Ripeness Doctrine -- Claims Arising from Emergency Demolition of Unsafe Building -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs' claims against the City of New York and various municipal agencies based upon their potential liability arising from the partial demolition of their five-story building pursuant to the determination of the City's Department of Buildings (DOB) that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and required emergency demolition were not ripe for judicial review and were dismissed as premature. Despite their claims for monetary damages, plaintiffs were in fact seeking judicial review of administrative actions without first availing themselves of all administrative remedies. With regard to liens placed against the property by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) based upon the partial demolition of the building, plaintiffs failed to submit the required notice (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 27-2129), and thus could not contest the HPD's emergency repair charges in a judicial or administrative proceeding. Similarly, plaintiffs failed to file any administrative appeals challenging the propriety of DOB's issuance of notices of violation regarding the building. Furthermore, plaintiffs' unspecified claims against the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) likewise failed because LPC had yet to pursue any claims against plaintiffs based on the building and its demolition. Under these circumstances, it could not be said that any of the involved agencies rendered a final determination from which plaintiffs could appeal in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Tort Liability -- Immunity for Discretionary Acts -- Claims Arising from Emergency Demolition of Unsafe Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs could not recover money damages from the City of New York based upon the partial demolition of their five-story building pursuant to the determination of the City's Department of Buildings (DOB) that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and required emergency demolition. DOB's determination that an immediate emergency existed, warranting demolition of the building, was a discretionary act entitling the city defendants to full immunity from liability. DOB's determination could not be deemed to be ministerial merely because DOB was required to follow a prescribed set of procedures before authorizing an emergency demolition (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Administrative Code of City of NY former &sect; 26-236). The determination of an emergency itself relied on the judgment of professionals, and was not improper merely because others would have reached a different conclusion as to the structural soundness of the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Torts -- Trespass -- Municipality's Emergency Demolition of Unsafe Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Plaintiffs failed to state a trespass claim against the City of New York based upon the partial demolition of their five-story building pursuant to the determination of the City's Department of Buildings that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and required emergency demolition where it had been determined that the demolition of the building was not arbitrary and capricious, and therefore not unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Indemnity -- When Claim for Indemnification Available -- Municipality's Emergency Demolition of Unsafe Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Plaintiffs failed to state a common-law claim for indemnification against the City of New York for claims raised by tenants in their five-story building that was partially demolished pursuant to the determination of the City's Department of Buildings that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and required emergency demolition. In order to state a claim for common-law indemnification, plaintiffs were required to allege that their injury was due solely to the negligence or wrongful acts of the city defendants, and plaintiffs failed to make any such allegations or even allege that the city defendants had any duty toward them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Damages -- Punitive Damages -- Municipality's Emergency Demolition of Unsafe Building</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for punitive damages against the City of New York and various city agencies and public officials based upon the partial demolition of their five-story building pursuant to the determination of the City's Department of Buildings that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and required emergency demolition. Even if plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief had survived dismissal, punitive damages are not recoverable against municipalities or public officials acting within the scope of their governmental duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor sued defendant city, alleging breach of contract. The city moved pursuant to 22 NYCRR 202.21(e) for an order vacating the contractor's note of issue and certificate of readiness for trial and pursuant to CPLR 3025(b) for leave to amend its answer. The contractor moved for an order declaring unconstitutional a program that required participants to award certain work to disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) contractors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that, because the contractor acknowledged in its certificate of readiness that discovery was not complete, the note of issue had to be vacated. The court held that, pursuant to 22 NYCRR 202.21(e), as it was undisputed that a deposition remained outstanding, a material fact in the certificate was incorrect. Having recently learned of the indictment of the contractor's officers, the city sought to amend its answer to include affirmative defenses of fraud and fraud or illegality in the contract performance. The contractor neither alleged nor demonstrated that the proposed amendment surprised or prejudiced it, and the amendment may have been meritorious. Moreover, there was no evidence that the city knew of the contractor's alleged fraudulent activities before the unsealing of the indictment in 2009, and, in any event, a delay in moving for leave did not, in and of itself, preclude amendment absent prejudice. The contractor's officers were not charged with violating the program which the contractor claimed was unconstitutional, and thus, any finding that the DBE program was unconstitutional was irrelevant and did not preclude of contractor's fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to vacate the note of issue was granted. Leave was granted for the city to amend its pleadings. The contractor's cross-motion for declaratory relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The note of issue filed by plaintiff in a breach of contract action against defendant City of New York relating to work performed on a construction project was vacated pursuant to 22 NYCRR 202.21 (e) where it was undisputed that defendant's request to depose a nonparty witness remained outstanding, thereby demonstrating that a material fact in plaintiff's statement of readiness was incorrect. Moreover, notwithstanding the parties' inability to choose a date for the deposition, since a party seeking the deposition of a nonparty witness has the option of conducting the deposition by oral or by written questions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 3108), defendant was not required to accept plaintiff's request that it depose the witness by written questions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Pleading - Amendment - Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims Alleging Fraud</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant City of New York was granted leave to amend its answer (CPLR 3025 [b]) in a breach of contract action relating to work performed on a construction project under a contract awarded in June 1999 to include affirmative defenses and counterclaims alleging fraud in the inducement and fraud or illegality in the performance of the contract based upon the indictment in 2008 of plaintiff's former officers on federal charges involving a scheme to defraud the New York Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. Plaintiff failed to allege or demonstrate that the proposed amendment would &quot;surprise or prejudice&quot; it, and the amendment was otherwise shown to be meritorious in view of the indictment of plaintiff's officers. Moreover, plaintiff offered no evidence that defendant knew of the alleged fraudulent activities before the unsealing of the indictment in 2009, and even if defendant knew before then, a delay in moving for leave does not, in and of itself, preclude the amendment of a pleading absent a demonstration of significant prejudice to the opposing party. In addition, to the extent that defendant might otherwise have been estopped from interposing the new fraud defenses and counterclaims by virtue of a 2004 memorandum of understanding between the parties, the subsequent indictment of plaintiff's officers effectively negated that estoppel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law - Validity of Regulation - Viability of Collateral Attack on Constitutionality of New York Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program to Avoid Liability on Fraud Claims in Breach of Contract Action </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiff was precluded in its breach of contract action against defendant City of New York relating to work performed on a construction project subject to the New York Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program from collaterally attacking the constitutionality of the New York DBE program to avoid liability under defendant's affirmative defenses and counterclaims alleging fraud in the inducement and fraud or illegality in the performance of the contract based upon the indictment of plaintiff's former officers on federal charges involving a scheme to defraud the New York DBE program. A party charged with fraudulently circumventing or conspiring to defraud in connection with a statute or regulation may not challenge the constitutionality of the statute or regulation. Moreover, since plaintiff's officers were indicted for conspiracy and mail and wire fraud and were not indicted for violating the New York DBE program, the constitutionality of that program was legally irrelevant to defendant's fraud claims. In any event, the federal DBE regulation and the New York DBE program have withstood constitutional challenges. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff associations sued defendant officials, seeking a declaration that the new registration fee set forth in the Health Care Improvement Act, Tax Law &sect; 480-a(2)(a)(ii), as amended by L 2009, ch. 58, pt. C, &sect; 125, was unconstitutional. The associations also sought a temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction to stay implementation of the amended statute pending a determination regarding its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The associations collectively represented approximately 10,000 retail fuel and food businesses which owned and operated neighborhood mini-marts, convenience stores and gas stations. The court found that, while, arguably, an individual retail store, one of the members, may have been required to pay a larger fee as imposed by the challenged legislation, and arguably, &quot;collectively,&quot; the members may have been required to pay a larger fee, there was no showing of injury in fact to any one single retail dealer, or that any one of the associations' members would have been forced to close down their business. The associations did not demonstrate, through competent admissible non-speculative evidence, other than mere assertions, that one member would have been harmed, or injured in fact. The associations did not put forward, or identify, one single retail member, or disclosed such members' gross sales to indicate how the revised fee would have forced such member to close down its business. The potential injuries to a member of the various trade associations were speculative, and, thus, insufficient to establish standing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties -- Standing -- Organizational Standing -- Challenge to Implementation of Revised Tobacco Retail Registration Fee </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, five trade associations that collectively represent approximately 10,000 members comprised of retail fuel and food businesses which own and operate neighborhood mini-marts, convenience stores and gas stations, lacked standing in a declaratory judgment action to enjoin defendants on constitutional grounds from implementing the newly revised tobacco retail registration fee that changed the prior $100 flat registration fee for the sale of retail tobacco products to a sliding scale fee based on the gross sales of all products at a location (Tax Law &sect; 480-a [2] [a] [ii]). In order for an association or organization to have standing to challenge an administrative action, it must demonstrate a harmful effect on at least one of its members. Here, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate through admissible nonspeculative evidence that any single member would be harmed or injured in fact by the new fee imposed on tobacco retailers. Plaintiffs failed to identify one retail member or disclose such member's gross sales to indicate how the revised fee would force such member to close down its business. The potential injuries to a member of the various trade associations were speculative and, therefore, insufficient to establish standing. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information alleged that defendant, a registered sex offender, passed along the front of a high school's bleachers during a soccer game. Defendant claimed that the People unlawfully sought to expand the conduct proscribed by Dunkirk, N.Y., City Code &sect; 64-3(B) to include entry onto school property, even though the proscribed conduct was specifically limited to entry into a school. The appellate court found, inter alia, that pursuant to CPL 100.15(3), 100.40(1), the information was no more and no less than a verbatim regurgitation of the language of &sect; 64-3(B) without specifying the exact locus criminis. The term &quot;school&quot; was then construed to include both the school's building and grounds. Accordingly, because the code as drafted did not invite arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, it was not facially insufficient or unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Because the People failed to timely serve notice upon defendant, CPL 710.30 required preclusion of his statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In the prosecution of defendant for violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting a sex offender from entering &quot;into any public or private school, nursery school, pre-school, child care facility, playground, or park&quot; (Dunkirk City Code &sect; 64-3 [B]), the accusatory instrument alleging that defendant, a registered sex offender, walked along a paved pathway on the grounds of a high school, passed by playing fields while a soccer game was in progress and stopped along the pathway outside of the girls' bathroom was facially sufficient, notwithstanding that there were no allegations that defendant entered the school building. The allegation that defendant walked past the field during a soccer game provided reasonable cause to believe that he committed the offense charged, as the offense included the term &quot;playground.&quot; Moreover, the rules of statutory construction and the stated purpose of the ordinance provided support for the interpretation of the undefined term &quot;school&quot; as including both the building and grounds. The term &quot;school,&quot; being associated with the words &quot;park&quot; and &quot;playground&quot; in the ordinance, can be interpreted in its broadest sense. In addition, the lawmakers' purpose for enacting the ordinance was to protect children from sex offenders, particularly in areas &quot;where minors are required to be present or congregate for recreation purposes&quot; (Dunkirk City Code &sect; 64-1 [D]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Restrictions on Sex Offenders -- Vagueness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A municipal ordinance prohibiting a sex offender from entering &quot;into any public or private school, nursery school, pre-school, child care facility, playground, or park&quot; (Dunkirk City Code &sect; 64-3 [B]) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, a registered sex offender who allegedly walked along a paved pathway on the grounds of a high school, passed by playing fields while a soccer game was in progress and stopped along the pathway outside of the girls' bathroom. It is commonly known that virtually all elementary and middle school grounds have playgrounds and virtually all high school grounds have athletic fields, and that such playgrounds and fields are accessible by walkways. Further, most individuals are on notice that a number of statutes give special protection to school buildings and grounds. Thus, the ordinance was sufficiently definite to put a person of ordinary intelligence on fair notice that the term &quot;school&quot; included buildings as well as grounds. The ordinance did not invite arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, as the determination as to what constitutes a &quot;school&quot; was not left to the enforcing officer. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent patient filed a motion to dismiss petitioner State's Mental Hygiene Law art. 10 petition, which sought to civilly confine him as a dangerous sex offender; the patient claimed that the State failed to state a cause of action and that application of art. 10 to him would violate his constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While confined at a developmental center, the patient allegedly assaulted a speech pathologist. Thereafter, he was indicted for first-degree sexual abuse and adjudicated an incapacitated person. Thereafter, the State initiated a proceeding pursuant to art. 10. When the patient refused to be examined by a psychiatrist and signed a document to that effect, an evaluation was performed by a licensed psychologist based upon his review of the available records. The court found, inter alia, that whether the evaluation would support the ultimate determination was for the fact-finder. Because the patient had not been convicted of a sexual offense, the application of art. 10 to him was unconstitutional. However, the State insured the patient's continued confinement by filing an appropriate action under Mental Hygiene Law art. 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action was denied, however, it was granted insofar as Mental Hygiene Law art. 10 was unconstitutional as applied to the patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Sufficiency of Petition </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The petition seeking civil confinement of petitioner pursuant to article 10 of the Mental Hygiene Law adequately stated a cause of action against respondent even though the psychological evaluation on which it was based did not include a personal interview of respondent. Pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.05 (e), respondent's case review team was entitled to arrange a psychiatric examination but was not required to do so. In addition, the records reviewed by the case review team were voluminous and consistent and provided a sufficient basis for the allegations in the petition.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Constitutionality of Mental Hygiene Law Article 10 as Applied to Certain Persons Lacking Capacity to Stand Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent, who allegedly committed sexual assault but was never convicted of any underlying sexual offense due to his incapacity to stand trial, was entitled to dismissal of the petition seeking his civil confinement pursuant to article 10 of the Mental Hygiene Law. Article 10 is unconstitutional as applied to a person who has never been convicted of an underlying sexual offense and who continues to be incapacitated and unable to assist in his or her defense under the criteria of CPL article 730. Respondent lacked the capacity to stand trial, the alleged crime was unwitnessed and required proof that the assault was motivated for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire, and respondent's proven mental retardation and limited functioning would make it virtually impossible for counsel to prepare a defense. Further, there was no need for the State to proceed under article 10, as respondent remained subject to civil confinement in an appropriate institution under Mental Hygiene Law article 15. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, department of taxation and its commissioner, filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff taxpayer's action to declare that Tax Law &sect; 210.1(g)(1), as it was in effect during the years 2003-2007, was unconstitutional; the taxpayer filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer did not follow the statutory formula in paying the fixed dollar minimum tax (FDMT) in &sect; 210(g)(1) because it believed the tax was unconstitutional, since it was imposed on the taxpayer's gross payroll, regardless of whether any of the payroll related to services provided by persons located in New York. After the defendants issued a deficiency notice, the taxpayer sought a hearing with the Division of Tax Appeals. Shortly thereafter, the defendants agreed with the taxpayer's calculations, refunded the overpayments for the years 2005 and 2006, and the tax appeal was dismissed. The court found, inter alia, that because the taxpayer's &quot;aggrievement&quot; had been ameliorated by the refund, it no longer maintained an actual stake in the matter being adjudicated. Accordingly, the taxpayer lacked standing to pursue its claim. After the taxpayer received the refunds, the FDMT was no longer being applied to it. Accordingly, the taxpayer did not meet the general standing requirements to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The taxpayer's claim for a refund for the 2003 tax return payment was time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Tax Law &sect; 1087(a).</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had already received refunds of such taxes it paid under the statute. To constitute an injury-in-fact for purposes of determining standing, the adverse impact on a petitioner's pecuniary interests must not be a remote and consequential result, but a direct one. Here, any injury-in-fact plaintiff may have experienced ceased when the taxes were refunded. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, governor and health commissioner, filed a motion to dismiss an application for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs, nursing homes and health facilities association (jointly, the homes), which challenged Public Health Law &sect; 2808(5)(c) (2009) and sought to prevent its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homes claimed that &sect; 2808(5)(c) imposed a statutory &quot;freeze&quot; on their owners' private bank accounts by requiring bureaucratic approval before withdrawal of equity or transfer of assets that could not exceed in the aggregate three percent of such facility's total Medicaid revenue in the prior calendar year. As a result, they claimed that the owners could not pay their expenses. The court found, inter alia, that the homes demonstrated a likelihood of ultimate success on the merits. They also demonstrated that they would suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction were not granted. Finally, the provision created a situation where a monetary award was not likely adequate compensation for the opportunities lost, the restriction on the owners' personal funds, and the ability to spend the funds as they wished. The defendants' interest was protected by Public Health Law &sect; 2808(5)(a). Therefore, the homes were entitled to a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

The statute, effective April 1, 2009, requires nursing home owners to apply to the Commissioner of Health for approval before withdrawing equity or transferring assets which would exceed in the aggregate 3% of the facility's total Medicaid revenue in the prior calendar year, and allows the Commissioner to approve or disapprove withdrawal requests based upon &quot;such other factors&quot; as the Commissioner &quot;deems appropriate.&quot; Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of ultimate success on the merits in establishing the unconstitutionality of the statute as being an improper delegation of legislative authority and otherwise failing to ensure due process and equal protection. Plaintiffs also established that they would suffer irreparable harm due to the statute's detrimental effect on an owner's ability to secure credit at market rates and pay taxes when due. Furthermore, should plaintiffs succeed, a monetary award would not likely adequately compensate them for the opportunities lost, the restriction on their personal funds and the ability to spend those funds as they wish. The State's interest is protected by Public Health Law &sect; 2808 (5) (a), which requires the Commissioner's approval for equity withdrawals that would &quot;create or increase negative net worth.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an earlier petition and remittal, petitioner doctor brought a second CPLR art. 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the determination of respondents New York State Workers' Compensation Board and its chair, which, pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 13-d(5), removed him as an eligible medical care provider within the workers' compensation system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor had pled guilty to one specification of misconduct, failure to maintain accurate records, before the Office of Professional Misconduct (OPMC). He was subject to a censure and reprimand, and placed on a three-year probation. This was the basis for the board's removal. The court found that, after the doctor was charged, he bought a digital EEG machine which eliminated the possibility of recurrence of the problem. The board and the chair, however, gave this mitigating factor no weight. Revocation was excessive. Moreover, as the court may have looked to the totality of the punishment for a given offense, the board could not have tacked on to the prior findings and penalty given by another agency, the OPMC, and then argue that the court had to examine their punishment in a vacuum, without consideration to the cumulative and detrimental effects that both determinations had. The board's decision deprived the doctor of 15 to 20 percent of his patient base, devastating his practice. There were no allegations of improper care or treatment of patients or other acts of medical negligence. The response of the board and the chair was totally unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted and the determination of revocation was annulled. The board and the chair were ordered to immediately restore the doctor to the list of eligible workers' compensation physicians.</SPAN></P>

Under the circumstances, the administrative sanction of removal from the list of workers' compensation providers was excessive and totally unreasonable, especially in the absence of any allegations of improper care or treatment of petitioner's patients or other acts of medical negligence. Moreover, respondents improperly gave no weight to the mitigating factor that the record-keeping violation involving petitioner's failure to maintain complete printouts from EEG tests had been fully remedied by petitioner's purchase of expensive new equipment, thereby eliminating the possibility of recurrence of the problem which resulted in the consent order.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unlicensed sale of costume jewelry on a public street in violation of Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 20-453. Defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that the prosecution here violated her right to free speech under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jewelry she sought to sell was &quot;art,&quot; and thus exempt from the licensing scheme generally applicable to sellers of merchandise on the public streets. The court found that defendant's claim failed. Defendant was not prevented from creating, displaying, or publicizing her wares-only from selling them. To be sure, that art was sold did not deprive it of the First Amendment protection it would otherwise enjoy. It was the sale itself that had to have been sufficiently expressive to warrant First Amendment scrutiny of &sect; 20-453. The First Amendment protected speech rather than objects. The License Law, &sect; 20-453, was content neutral, and in no way sought to censor the vendors it attempted to regulate. Despite the strictures of the ordinance, defendant remained free to make her jewelry, to give it away, and even to display it on the street. Thus, the law in no way precluded defendant from reaching public audiences on the sidewalks generally, or in any of the specific venues where she currently hawked her wares.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's prosecution for the unlicensed sale of costume jewelry on a New York City public street did not violate her First Amendment right to free speech. The City's licensing scheme (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-453) constitutes a reasonable time, place or manner restriction on defendant's otherwise unfettered right to sell her merchandise. Defendant's jewelry did not qualify as &quot;sculpture,&quot; which, like other visual &quot;art&quot; such as paintings, photographs or prints, would be sufficiently expressive to at least trigger First Amendment review. Rather, jewelry falls squarely within the category of goods that are merely potentially expressive, and when items offered for sale are only potentially expressive, the requirement that their sale be licensed constitutes a permissible time, place or manner restriction. The licensing ordinance is content neutral and in no way seeks to censor the vendors it attempts to regulate. Defendant remained free to manufacture, show and advertise her jewelry, and even to sell it, but not in public spaces without a license. Moreover, since the ordinance may constitutionally be applied to defendant, there was no need to hold a pretrial hearing on defendant's dismissal motion or otherwise inspect the merchandise at issue (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 170.45, 210.45 [5] [a]). </SPAN></P>

Upon learning that the lifeguards were employees of the university's student government association, the State sought to implead them into the diver's action. The Court of Claims found, inter alia, that there was no showing that a material fact in the certificate of readiness was incorrect, nor was there a showing that the case, insofar as the State was concerned, was not ready for trial. The lifeguards were not necessary parties to the action or claim. Therefore, they could not be impleaded or interpleaded into the action under Court of Claims Act &sect; 9(6). Pursuant to CPLR 3001, the coverage dispute was properly the subject of a declaratory judgment action in a supreme court, not the Court of Claims. There were no legitimate and pending discovery requests. Accordingly, there was no basis to strike the diver's note of issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action to recover damages for injuries claimant sustained while diving into a swimming pool at a state university campus, defendant's motion to strike the note of issue on the grounds that the lifeguards were necessary parties who had not been joined, and there remained an issue regarding the obligation of the lifeguards' insurance carrier to defend and indemnify defendant, was denied. There was no showing that a material fact in the certificate of readiness was incorrect, nor was there a showing that the case, insofar as the named defendant was concerned, was not ready for trial (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uniform Rules for Trial Cts [22 NYCRR] &sect; 206.12 [d]). The lifeguards were not &quot;necessary parties&quot; to the action, and could not be joined as either codefendants or third-party defendants. The coverage dispute was properly the subject of a declaratory judgment action in Supreme Court, not the Court of Claims (CPLR 3001), and, in any event, there was no indication that such an action had even been commenced. Moreover, the only incomplete discovery alleged by defendant was that which would be conducted by counsel for the lifeguards, who were not properly subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, or hypothetical discovery which might be desired by the insurance carrier's counsel should defendant be successful in a yet-to-be-commenced declaratory judgment action. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective observed defendants and 22 others, who were all wearing gang colors, at a park. The detective, upon seeing them exchange hand signs and distinctive hand shakes, concluded that they were engaged in a universal meeting at which future gang activities were planned and discussed, including violent criminal activity. The court found, inter alia, that the offense of unlawful assembly did not impermissibly infringe upon the rights to free speech and free assembly under the First Amendment. That the detective did not detail what specific future violent criminal activity defendants were planning did not render the information deficient. The facts alleged were enough to show that defendants were preparing to engage in the generalized &quot;violent and tumultuous conduct&quot; required by &sect; 240.10, and were adequate to inform defendants as to the nature of the charges against them. Therefore, because the information satisfied CPL 100.15, it was not jurisdictionally defective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The unlawful assembly statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.10), which proscribes assembling with four or more other persons &quot;for the purpose of engaging or preparing to engage ... in tumultuous and violent conduct likely to cause public alarm,&quot; does not impermissibly infringe upon the First Amendment rights to free speech and free assembly and is thus constitutional on its face. The statute does not purport to penalize assembly &quot;merely to advocate&quot; the use of force or violence. Rather, by punishing assembly with others for the defined and specific purpose of engaging or preparing to engage in violent and tumultuous conduct, the statute observes the established distinction between mere constitutionally protected advocacy and &quot;incitement to imminent lawless action.&quot; Moreover, since &quot;clear and present danger&quot; is inherent in assembly with others to prepare to engage in violent and tumultuous conduct likely to cause public alarm, the statute was not required to expressly provide as an element that the offender's conduct constitute an &quot;incitement to imminent lawless action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Assembly -- Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An accusatory instrument charging defendants with unlawful assembly (Penal Law &sect; 240.10) was facially sufficient (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 100.40 [1] [c]) based upon the allegations of the deponent police officer that he observed defendants congregating, without a special events permit (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;56 RCNY 1-05 [a] [1]), in a public park with 22 other individuals all wearing the colors of a notorious street gang with a history of committing violent crimes and exchanging distinctive hand signs and handshakes. The officer's extensive investigatory experience and training on gang activity provided ample support for his conclusion that the assembly was a &quot;universal meeting&quot; at which future gang activities, including violent criminal activity, were planned. The facts alleged were sufficient to show that defendants were preparing to engage in the generalized violent and tumultuous conduct required by the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion opposing resentencing, arguing that to do so violated his double jeopardy and due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole for first- and second-degree robbery, defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery. On the date of sentence, an assistant attorney general stated that no predicate statement was filed because of the plea. Thereafter, the Department of Correctional Services realized that defendant was a second violent felony offender and computed his time to run consecutively to the time he still owed on his original conviction. After his release from prison, defendant sued the State for compensation for wrongful confinement for the time period between September, 2005 and March, 2007. The court found, inter alia, that because defendant should have been aware that he should have been adjudicated a second violent felony offender under CPL 400.15, he could not have a legitimate expectation of the finality of an illegal sentence. The stated excuse of the assistant district attorney for not filing a predicate statement did not relieve the court of its obligation to resentence defendant in accordance with Penal Law &sect; 70.45. Therefore, he could be resentenced without running afoul of the double jeopardy and due process clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion was denied, and the People were directed to file the appropriate second violent felony offender statement so that defendant could be arraigned on it, be adjudicated a second violent felony offender, and then be resentenced accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Violent Felony Offender -- Mandatory Resentencing to Correct Sentencing Error</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, who was not initially adjudicated as a second violent felony offender upon his 1992 robbery conviction as mandated by CPL 400.15, could lawfully be resentenced following his release from prison in 2007 in order to correct the sentencing error. Defendant had been released after the Department of Correctional Services recalculated his jail time to reflect that the 1992 sentence should run concurrently with his 1986 violent felony convictions, rather than consecutively, because he had not been adjudicated as a second violent felony offender. The sentencing court's inherent authority to correct an illegal sentence is not limited by CPL 440.40 (1), which affords the People one year to file a motion to set aside a sentence. Where the law mandates that a defendant be adjudicated a predicate felony offender but the sentencing court fails to do so, the error must be remedied by resentencing, regardless of the passage of time. Furthermore, resentencing defendant would not violate his constitutional right against double jeopardy or his right to due process. Since defendant was aware of the illegal sentence, he could not be deemed to have had a legitimate expectation of the finality of his sentence, nor could his resentencing be deemed a vindictive or retaliatory prosecution in response to his civil suit seeking compensation for his alleged wrongful confinement in the absence of any proof of an improper motive. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an omnibus motion that sought, inter alia, to reduce the charges in counts 1 and 2 based on the rule of lenity, to compel disclosure of the victim's psychiatric, medical, and school records, and that a combined hearing on impeachment material and Molineux issues be conducted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count 1 charged defendant with predatory sexual assault against a child. Count 2 charged the same crime on the same legal theory, on a different date, against the same complainant. Counts 3 and 4 charged first-degree criminal sexual act with the same victim. Count 5 charged endangering the welfare of a child. The court found, inter alia, that defense counsel was asking it to declare both the first-degree rape statute,&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 130.45(4), and the predatory sexual assault statute,&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 130.96, unconstitutional as applied to defendant because of the huge disparity in sentencing requirements and plea restrictions for the two crimes. Although defendant raised a serious and troubling issue, the issue had been squarely decided by appellate courts. Consequently, the trial court was not free to review the constitutional arguments based on the issues raised by the defense. Because it was alleged from the victim's mother, by affidavit of a person with whom the mother spoke, that the victim suffered from bi-polar disease and had a habit of lying on a regular basis, defense counsel made a sufficient showing to merit an in camera inspection of the victim's mental health records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss or reduce the counts was denied, the motion to compel the victim's school records was denied, the motion to compel the victim's mental health records was granted insofar as an in camera inspection, the motion was granted as to setting a combined hearing on impeachment material and Molineux issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Predatory Sexual Assault against Child -- Rule of Lenity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, who was charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child for committing the crime of rape in the first degree against a female victim less than 13 years old when he was more than 18 years old (Penal Law &sect; 130.96), was not entitled under the rule of lenity to reduction of those class A-II felony counts to the lesser class B felony of rape in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 130.35 [4]) because the two crimes have identical elements, but different permissible sentences and different plea bargaining restrictions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 70.45 [2-a] [f]; &sect; 70.80 [4] [a] [i]) and the statute provides no guidance as to when the lesser or greater crime should be charged other than as the result of a subjective assessment of the relative &quot;heinous quality&quot; of the particular defendant's acts. The rule of lenity can be applied to give a criminal defendant the lesser of two available penalties where the statutes involved are sufficiently ambiguous so as to fail to give notice of the scope of punishment. Here, there was no ambiguity because the legislative history indicated that the predatory sexual assault statute was enacted to increase penalties to further deter and punish sexual offenders who commit heinous and egregious acts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Bill of Particulars</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, who was charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child (Penal Law &sect; 130.96), was not entitled to a bill of particulars pursuant to CPL 200.95 disclosing the substance of his conduct relating to those counts that would justify the prosecution's decision to charge him with that crime rather than with the lesser class B felony of rape in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 130.35 [4]). The request for a bill of particulars, aside from being untimely, was also unnecessary. The prosecution was free to decide under which statute to charge defendant, and absent evidence of an abuse of discretion, that decision is not subject to judicial review. Furthermore, the court, if asked to do so by defense counsel, would have submitted the lesser crime to the jury in the alternative.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant, who was charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child (Penal Law &sect; 130.96), was not entitled via judicial subpoena duces tecum or pursuant to disclosure under CPL article 240 to the victim's school records for use for impeachment purposes. Potential impeachment use at trial is not a sufficient justification for issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, especially where, as here, the demand is based on defense counsel's speculation as to what information would be found in the records. Moreover, the records were not in the possession of the prosecution and thus were not discoverable.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant, who was charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child (Penal Law &sect; 130.96), was entitled to in camera inspection via judicial subpoena duces tecum of the victim's mental health records. There were allegations that the victim suffered from bipolar disease and had a habit of lying on a regular basis. Since the victim's testimony would have direct bearing on defendant's guilt or innocence, information relevant to her credibility constitutes exculpatory material helpful to the defense that must be disclosed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the New York discretionary persistent felony offender sentencing scheme was not unconstitutional in that it did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. The  sentencing scheme, after defendant was deemed eligible to be sentenced as a persistent felony offender, required that the sentencing court make a qualitative judgment about, among other things, defendant's criminal history and the circumstances surrounding a particular offense in order to determine whether an enhanced sentence, under the statutorily prescribed sentencing range, was warranted. The New York sentencing scheme, by requiring that sentencing courts to consider defendant's &quot;history and character&quot; and the &quot;nature and circumstances&quot; of defendant's conduct in deciding where, within a range, to impose an enhanced sentence, set the parameters for the performance of one of the sentencing court's most traditional and basic functions, i.e., the exercise of sentencing discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's discretionary persistent felony offender sentencing scheme (Penal Law &sect; 70.10; CPL 400.20) does not violate the right to jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Under New York's scheme, a defendant is subject to an enhanced sentence based solely on the existence of two prior felony convictions. Unlike the invalid sentencing schemes in other states which effectively provided for judicial fact-finding of an element of an offense as a prerequisite to enhancing a sentence beyond the relevant sentencing range, the New York scheme, after a defendant is deemed eligible to be sentenced as a persistent felony offender, requires that the sentencing court make a qualitative judgment about, among other things, the defendant's criminal history and the circumstances surrounding a particular offense in order to determine whether an enhanced sentence, under the statutorily prescribed sentencing range, is warranted. New York's sentencing scheme sets the parameters for the performance of one of the sentencing court's most traditional and basic functions, i.e., the exercise of sentencing discretion. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state senators filed a motion for an order preliminarily enjoining defendants, governor, appointee, and secretary of state, from, inter alia, presiding over the senate; the defendants filed cross-motions for an order dismissing the complaint in its entirety and for an order changing the place of trial on the ground of improper venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the 2009 election, a majority of the senators elected a temporary president and majority leader. Thereafter, two Democratic members joined 30 Republican senators in an effort to remove him as the temporary president. The governor appointed the appointee to break the resulting procedural deadlock. The court found, inter alia, that the senators properly characterized their action as one for a declaratory judgment. Since the governor was not authorized by N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 to appoint a lieutenant-governor, a fortiori he was not under a statutory duty to make the appointment. The defendants failed to make any showing to support their motion to change venue. Since resolution of the governor's power to make the appointment was not a task assigned to another branch of government, the controversy was not a political question. The senators alleged a usurpation of senate power that gives rise to a sufficient injury in fact falling within their zone of interest, which gave them standing. In addition, the senators established a likelihood of success on the merits for their claim. Accordingly, a preliminary injunction under CPLR 6311(1) was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator's motion was granted, the defendants' motions were denied, and the appointee was preliminarily enjoined from exercising any of the powers of the office of lieutenant-governor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trial -- Place of Trial -- Venue of Declaratory Judgment Action Challenging Authority of Governor to Appoint Lieutenant Governor to Fill Vacancy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Nassau County was a proper venue under CPLR 509 for a declaratory judgment action challenging the authority of defendant Governor under NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6 to appoint a Lieutenant Governor to fill a vacancy in that office. CPLR 506 (b), the special venue provision for a CPLR article 78 proceeding which requires that the proceeding be brought in any county within the judicial district &quot;where the respondent made the determination complained of . . . or where the material events otherwise took place, or where the principal office of the respondent is located,&quot; was inapplicable, since the action could not properly be characterized an article 78 proceeding. A declaratory judgment action, as opposed to a more limited article 78 proceeding, is the appropriate vehicle to test the constitutionality of executive action. The separation of powers doctrine militates against the type of summary relief available in an article 78 proceeding where, as here, it is claimed that legislative or executive action is unconstitutional on its face. In addition, since plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief was incidental to their request for a declaratory judgment, the venue provision of CPLR 6311 (1) was also inapplicable to require that the place of trial be transferred to Albany County. Furthermore, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the inconvenience of unnamed material witnesses warranted a change of venue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Questions -- Constitutional Challenge to Governor's Authority to Fill Vacancy in Office of Lieutenant Governor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A declaratory judgment action challenging the authority of defendant Governor under NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6 to appoint a Lieutenant Governor to fill a vacancy in that office presented a justiciable controversy. Although the dispute concerning the Governor's power to appoint a Lieutenant Governor arose from a &quot;political context,&quot; it did not present a nonjusticiable political question that would violate the separation of powers doctrine. Furthermore, the fact that the Lieutenant Governor had already taken the oath of office did not render the action moot. A determination that the Governor was without power to appoint a Lieutenant Governor would have the immediate, practical consequence of preventing the Lieutenant Governor from continuing to perform the duties of that office or standing first in the governorship's line of succession.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- When Remedy Appropriate  -- Constitutional Challenge to Governor's Authority to Fill Vacancy in Office of Lieutenant Governor -- Quo Warranto Proceeding Not Exclusive Remedy Available</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A declaratory judgment action was the appropriate vehicle to challenge the authority of defendant Governor under NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6 to appoint a Lieutenant Governor to fill a vacancy in that office. A quo warranto proceeding by the Attorney General (Executive Law &sect; 63-b) was not the exclusive remedy available. Such a proceeding is intended to challenge the results of an election to avoid the risk of leaving a contested office vacant for a possibly protracted period. The action challenging the Governor's power to appoint a Lieutenant Governor does not involve a contested election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Constitutional Challenge to Governor's Authority to Fill Vacancy in Office of Lieutenant Governor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs, members of the New York State Senate, had standing to maintain a declaratory judgment action challenging the authority of defendant Governor under NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6 to appoint a Lieutenant Governor to fill a vacancy in that office. Prior to the Governor's appointment, a temporary president elected by plaintiffs and the other members of the Senate would have presided over the Senate and also have stood next in the succession to the governorship (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art III, &sect; 9). Consequently, plaintiffs alleged a usurpation of Senate power that gives rise to a sufficient injury-in-fact falling within their zone of interest as to grant them standing to maintain the action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- Powers of Governor -- Lack of Authority to Fill Vacancy in Office of Lieutenant Governor -- Preliminary Injunction</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Governor lacked the authority pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 43 to appoint a Lieutenant Governor to fill a vacancy in that office. NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6, which requires that the Governor and Lieutenant Governor be elected at the same time, should also be read as requiring that the office of Lieutenant Governor remain vacant until such time as a Governor is elected. NY Constitution, article XIII, &sect; 3, which authorizes the Legislature to determine how vacancies in &quot;elective office&quot; are filled but requires that the appointee run at the next election, cannot apply to the office of Lieutenant Governor. Consequently, Public Officers Law &sect; 43, which authorizes the Governor to fill a vacancy in an &quot;elective office&quot; until the vacancy is filled by an election, cannot, consistent with NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 6, be interpreted to authorize the Governor to fill a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor. Consequently, plaintiffs demonstrated their entitlement to a preliminary injunction preventing the Governor from filling a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff and defendant's civil union under Vermont law was valid and properly contracted notwithstanding the fact that neither party resided in Vermont at the time they received their certificate of union, and notwithstanding language contained in the certificate that specifically authorized the establishment of a civil union &quot;in Vermont only.&quot; Vermont's civil union statute provides that any town clerk in the state may issue a license to applicants &quot;if neither is a resident of the state&quot; (18 Vt Stat Ann &sect; 5160 [a]), and the Vermont Supreme Court has confirmed that residency in Vermont is not a requirement for obtaining a civil union under the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff, who entered into a valid civil union with defendant in Vermont, was not entitled to dissolution of the alleged &quot;marriage between the parties&quot; pursuant to Domestic Relations Law &sect; 170 (1) on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. Although New York courts will generally recognize out-of-state marriages as a matter of comity, a civil union contracted in the State of Vermont is not a legal marriage and therefore may not be dissolved by way of a matrimonial proceeding commenced in New York. The dismissal of the complaint, however, was without prejudice to plaintiff's right to file a verified complaint for dissolution of the Vermont civil union. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a chief judge and the State Unified Court System, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, the Governor of the State of New York and state officials, alleging, among other things, that they violated the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers guaranteed by N.Y. Const. art. VI and that the judicial salaries codified in Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 221 through 221-(i) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that defendants violated the Constitution by linking judicial salaries to unrelated issues and thereby refusing to enact into law reforms of judicial compensation, which defendants conceded were necessary. The supreme court noted that the parties had recognized that issues in the case that were raised and decided in a previous case had to be decided in the same manner. It held that through the practice of linkage, defendants unconstitutionally abused their power by depriving the judiciary of any increase in compensation. The supreme court declared that the first two causes of plaintiffs' action failed to state a viable claim of a constitutional violation. The remaining issue to be resolved was plaintiffs' assertion that &sect;&sect; 221 through 221-(i), which set forth the salaries of State-paid judges, was unconstitutional. The supreme court concluded that plaintiffs had not argued that the challenged Judiciary Law sections were unconstitutional when enacted, nor could their counsel state a date when the sections allegedly became unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted defendants' motions to dismiss in part, granted plaintiffs' request that it search the record and grant summary judgment to them on the third cause of action, declaring the unconstitutionality of the linkage practice, and dismissed the first two causes of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action challenging the Legislature's failure to increase judicial compensation, plaintiffs failed to state a viable claim that defendants violated the constitutional prohibition against the diminution of judicial compensation (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) by permitting judicial compensation, last adjusted in 1998, to diminish by virtue of inflation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action challenging the Legislature's failure to increase judicial compensation, plaintiffs failed to state a viable claim that Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 221 through 221-i, setting forth the salaries of state-paid judges and last adjusted in 1998, were presently unconstitutional. Plaintiffs did not claim that the challenged Judiciary Law sections were unconstitutional when enacted, and could not state a date when the sections allegedly became unconstitutional. The alleged erosion in value of the salaries due to inflation did not render the statutory amounts unconstitutionally inadequate.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action challenging the Legislature's failure to increase judicial compensation, plaintiffs failed to state a viable claim that the judiciary had been unconstitutionally discriminated against in comparison to the vast majority of other state employees who had received increases to compensate for the rate of inflation. The failure of the Legislature to adjust judicial salaries was equally true with respect to salaries of the statewide elected officials, the members of the Legislature and commissioners appointed by the Governor whose salaries are fixed by statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner of property subject to tax liens brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant department, challenging a jeopardy assessment of sales tax against her, and asserting that Tax Law &sect; 1138 was inapplicable to her, that the assessment and lien should have been declared null and void, and that she was entitled to a refund of the sums paid by her to the department. The department moved to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assessment was made against the owner because she was alleged to have been an officer or other responsible person associated with a corporation which owed the tax. The department argued that the owner failed to exhaust all administrative remedies. The owner claimed that she met the exceptions to the exhaustion rule. The court found that &sect; 1138(b) allowed an assessment against an officer or other responsible person. However, the jeopardy assessment was made after the last date that the return was required to be filed, not before as required by Tax Law &sect; 1136(b). Thus, the department's assessment was untimely, and was, as applied to the owner, wholly inapplicable. The department had no power to make a jeopardy assessment against the owner under Tax Law &sect; 1138(b) at the time it did. Further, any pursuit of administrative remedies by the owner would have been futile. The owner was financially unable to deposit the sales tax allegedly owed, nor able to post a bond. She would not have been excused from either depositing the full amount of tax or posting a bond in order to seek judicial review of a determination made by the division of tax appeals or the tax appeals tribunal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Sales Tax Jeopardy Assessment &quot;Wholly Inapplicable&quot; to Taxpayer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies before commencing a declaratory judgment action challenging the issuance of a jeopardy assessment of sales tax against her pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 1138 (b). The jeopardy assessment against plaintiff was made after the last date that the return was required to be filed, not prior to such date as required by the statute. Therefore, the jeopardy assessment was untimely as a matter of law. Accordingly, at the time it was made, the jeopardy assessment was, as applied to plaintiff, wholly inapplicable, thereby triggering an exception to the rule that a party must exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking relief in the courts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Futility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies before commencing a declaratory judgment action challenging the issuance of a jeopardy assessment of sales tax against her pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 1138 (b), since any pursuit of administrative remedies would have been futile. Prior to seeking judicial review of a jeopardy assessment, a party must comply with the tax deposit or bond provisions found in Tax Law &sect; 1138 (a) (4). However, plaintiff alleged that she was financially unable to deposit the tax allegedly owed and that she could not afford to post a bond. Although the statute was amended to provide for an administrative determination as to whether someone was personally liable for sales tax and eliminated the requirement that the tax be deposited or a bond posted when such determination was judicially challenged, plaintiff alleged that section 1138 was not applicable to her. Accordingly, had plaintiff asked for a hearing on the issue of the general applicability of section 1138 (b) and received an adverse determination, she would have had to deposit the tax or post a bond prior to seeking judicial review. Section 1138 (a) (4) would not have absolved plaintiff from that requirement. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partners's marriage in the Netherlands was recognized in New York. The child of the married couple already had a recognized and protected child/parent relationship with both partners, arguably making adoption unnecessary and impermissibly duplicative. Regardless, the partners sought an order of adoption that would be subject to full faith and credit and would recognize their rights as parents of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Recognition and protection of the genetic mother's parental rights existed in New York, but not in the rest of the country. The court found that 1) the Full Faith and Credit Clause offered no protection; 2) a birth certificate was only prima facie evidence of parentage (under Public Health Law &sect; 4103) and did not, in and of itself, confer parental rights that were recognized elsewhere; 3) no statute dealt directly with the issue of whether the law should recognize both parties in a committed lesbian relationship--the gestational mother, and the genetic mother of a child--as the child's legal parents without an adoption; and 4) the paternity statutes were overtly discriminatory. Because a judicial order of adoption in one state had to be given full faith and credit in every other state, and there was no public policy exception to that recognition, only a judicial order of filiation would provide the requested protection. Although adoption should be unnecessary, the child's best interests required a judgment that ensured recognition of both women as the child's legal parents throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the genetic mother's petition to adopt the child, and, as a matter of law, in addition to her own genetic and loving connection, she was accorded all the rights and responsibilities appurtenant to the relationship of parent to her son.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Who May Adopt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second-parent adoption (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 110 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) was granted by Surrogate's Court at the request of all the parties in order to permit petitioner, the genetic/biological mother of a child born to her lawful same-sex spouse via in vitro fertilization, to establish a formal parent-child relationship with the child. Petitioner and the gestational mother, who were legally married in a foreign jurisdiction, lived together and coparented the child, who they considered to be the child of each of them. Although equal protection considerations would allow petitioner to utilize less intrusive, expensive and time-consuming methods of establishing her legal relationship with the child either through a new birth certificate amended to reflect the parentage of both mothers, a statutory acknowledgment of paternity (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 4135-b; Social Services Law &sect; 111-k; Family Ct Act &sect; 516-a) or a filiation proceeding to &quot;determine parentage&quot; under a constitutionally mandated gender-neutral reading of the paternity laws, a second-parent adoption was necessary to ensure recognition of both mothers as the child's legal parents throughout the entire United States. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion pursuant to CPL &sect; 170.30(1)(a) to dismiss an information charging her with offering printed material without a permit in violation of Town of Oyster Bay, N.Y., Town Code &sect; 168-16 and trespass in violation of Penal Law &sect; 140.05. Defendant argued that Code &sect; 168-16 was unconstitutional on its face, and the trespass charge was predicated on a finding that her actions and presence in a park were unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for distributing literature in a park without a permit. The district court held that nothing on the face of the Code or its implementing regulations suggested that they were anything but content neutral. Code &sect; 168-16 did not take into account the organization, speaker, or message as a condition for requiring a permit. Town of Oyster Bay, N.Y., Department of Parks Rules and Regulations &sect; 3(a)(1) provided, without reference to organization, speaker, or message, that no person could hold or sponsor a special event or demonstration in town parks without a permit. There was nothing in the Code or the implementing regulations that removed commercial literature from the ambit of Regulation &sect; 3(f)(2), requiring the issuance of a permit. The district court concluded that Code &sect; 168-16, and Regulation &sect; 3(f)(2) were unconstitutional on their faces as overbroad. Although it could have been the town's intention to limit the permit requirement to special events and demonstrations, Code &sect; 168-16 and Regulation &sect; 3(f)(2) were much broader in their scope and application. These sections applied to any person, at any time, anywhere in a town park or recreational facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information charging her with distributing printed material without a permit and trespass.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- First Amendment Rights -- Permit Requirement for Distribution of Literature in Public Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trespass charge filed against defendant for distributing religious literature in a town park during a free outdoor concert without a permit in violation of the town ordinance was dismissed due to the unconstitutionality of the ordinance. Notwithstanding the town's good faith effort to enact a content-neutral ordinance that would constitutionally regulate the distribution of expressive material in the town parks, the ordinance and implementing regulations as written were not narrowly tailored to meet the town's legitimate, compelling governmental interest in being able to regulate and control the patrons of its parks and recreational facilities, and were thus constitutionally overbroad on their faces. The ordinance did not limit the permit requirement to &quot;special event&quot; days and &quot;demonstrations.&quot; Rather, the ordinance on its face prohibited any person from engaging in the &quot;distribution of printed or similarly expressive material without a permit,&quot; and merely provided an additional requirement of distributing leaflets from a fixed location on &quot;special event&quot; days. The representation of the town's regulatory agency that the ordinance would be narrowly interpreted to limit permit requests to &quot;special event&quot; days was insufficient to overcome the facial invalidity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant brought an action against respondent State, alleging that he was wrongfully placed on post release supervision (PRS) for a five year period and was unlawfully arrested, wrongfully detained, and falsely imprisoned. The State moved for summary judgment dismissing the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing judge never pronounced PRS as part of claimant's sentence. However the State's Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) determined that claimant was to be under PRS for five years. Claimant was arrested on alleged curfew violations and was re-incarcerated. However, the DOCS lacked the authority to impose PRS. The court found that the State's motion was unsupported by an affidavit by a person having knowledge of the facts, as required by CPLR 3212(b). Counsel's affirmation and the verified answer were insufficient. The issue was whether DOCS was acting in an objectively reasonable manner when it determined that it could lawfully add the PRS. However, the State cited no express statutory or regulatory authority allowing DOCS to impose PRS. To establish that it was acting under color of law, the State had to demonstrate that DOCS was acting in an objectively reasonable manner in adding the period of PRS to claimant's sentence or that the PRS term was automatically included therein. On the motion for summary judgment as a matter of law, the State did not make such a demonstration, and thus, the motion could not have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with depraved indifference murder, pursuant to CPL 210.30, 210.20, 210.40, and on various other grounds. A federal court had previously vacated his conviction for depraved indifference murder after a Brady violation was established. Subsequently, the People sought to retry defendant on that count to which defendant has responded with his motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from the stabbing death of the victim in front of a night club. The Brady material involved a statement from another man that he had stabbed the victim two times before defendant allegedly stabbed the victim. The federal court had found that there was a reasonable probability that had such exculpatory information been disclosed to the defense, the case would have been different. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on an insufficiency ground and to reinspect the grand jury minutes as controlling case law provided no legal basis to grant the motion on those grounds. The court found that retrial was not barred on double jeopardy grounds since the conviction was vacated for the Brady violation, not on the ground that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient. The court found no merit to defendant's contentions that collateral estoppel or prosecutorial misconduct barred his retrial. The court further found that the interest of justice did not bar retrial since considering the factors set forth in CPL 210.40(1), defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of some compelling factor justifying such relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and/or to bar a retrial in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Depraved Indifference Murder -- Retroactive Application of Judicial Decision</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, who faced retrial on a charge of depraved indifference murder after his conviction was vacated by a federal court on the ground of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation, was not entitled to dismissal of the indictment on the ground that the evidence adduced before the grand jury was legally insufficient to establish the offense of depraved indifference murder under current New York case law. Prior to the commencement of his trial in 2000, defendant had filed a motion to dismiss the indictment that was denied by Supreme Court on the ground that the evidence presented to the grand jury was legally sufficient. As a general rule, a court should not reconsider, disturb or overrule an order of another court of coordinate jurisdiction in the same action unless the defendant has made a showing that extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant a departure from the doctrine of the law of the case. At the time the determination was made with respect to defendant's prior motion to dismiss the indictment, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Register</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (60 NY2d 270, 457 NE2d 704, 469 NYS2d 599 [1983]) was the controlling law in the State of New York, but the Court of Appeals subsequently overruled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Register</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Feingold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (7 NY3d 288, 294, 852 NE2d 1163, 819 NYS2d 691 [2006]), holding that &quot;depraved indifference to human life&quot; is a culpable mental state. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Feingold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applied to all cases pending on direct appeal where the defendant had adequately challenged the sufficiency of the proof as to his or her depraved indifference murder conviction, but was not applicable to defendant, whose conviction became final on May 3, 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes- - Double Jeopardy -- Retrial on Depraved Indifference Murder Charge after Change in Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The retrial of defendant on a charge of depraved indifference murder after his conviction was vacated by a federal court on the ground of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation was not barred by the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. As a general rule, the double jeopardy doctrine does not preclude the retrial of a defendant who succeeds in having a conviction reversed on appeal, unless the conviction was reversed upon the ground that the evidence was legally insufficient, or the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct deliberately intended to provoke a mistrial. Here, defendant's conviction was vacated on the ground of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation, not on the ground that the evidence was legally insufficient, and no mistrial had been declared.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Collateral Estoppel -- Retrial on Depraved Indifference Murder Charge after Change in Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The retrial of defendant on a charge of depraved indifference murder after his conviction was vacated by a federal court on the ground of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation was not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Where, as here, a defendant has been acquitted by a jury of some of the charges in a multi-count indictment and the conviction has been reversed on appeal due to a trial error, the People are not foreclosed by collateral estoppel concerns from reprosecuting the defendant on the charge which resulted in conviction. At his first trial defendant was acquitted of the intentional murder charge, which indicated that the jury did not conclude that defendant intended to cause the victim's death. As a determination regarding the defendant's intent is not the sine qua non of a conviction of depraved indifference murder, the People were not foreclosed by collateral estoppel from retrying the depraved indifference murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Failure to Disclose Exculpatory Material -- Order Barring Retrial Not Appropriate Remedy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant, whose depraved indifference murder conviction was vacated by a federal court, was not entitled to an order barring a retrial on the ground that, as the federal court had found, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation occurred during the first trial. An order barring the retrial in order to punish the People for the failure to disclose and to deter any future violations was not warranted, as the underlying principle of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady v Maryland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (373 US 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 [1963]) is not punishment of society for misdeeds of a prosecutor, but rather avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Argument and Conduct of Counsel -- Order Barring Retrial Not Appropriate Remedy for Failure to Disclose Exculpatory Material</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendant, whose depraved indifference murder conviction was vacated by a federal court on the ground of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation, was not entitled to an order barring a retrial on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. There was no reason to deviate from the federal court's determination that the appropriate remedial relief was a retrial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Indictment -- Dismissal in Interest of Justice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant, who faced retrial on a charge of depraved indifference murder after his conviction was vacated by a federal court on the ground of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation, was not entitled to dismissal of the indictment in the interest of justice (CPL 210.20 [1] [i]; 210.40). Defendant failed to sustain his initial burden of making a prima facie showing of some compelling factor, consideration or circumstance which would render his conviction or prosecution on the underlying charges unjust. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violation itself did not warrant a dismissal pursuant to CPL 210.40 (1) (e), and in view of the seriousness of the crime charged, the impact of the crime on the public interest weighed heavily against dismissal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owners of guns brought a proceeding pursuant to, inter alia, CPLR art. 78, seeking an order: (1) permanently enjoining respondents from enforcing Nassau County, N.Y., Miscellaneous Laws, tit. 69, Local Law 5-2008 (Local Law 5-2008), and (2) for, in effect, a declaration that Local Law 5-2008 was unconstitutional, unduly vague, and/or pre-empted by relevant state law enactments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners primarily argued that Local Law 5-2008 was preempted by applicable state law enactments which allegedly fully occupied the field of handgun regulation. The court found that the owners lacked standing for certain of the claims, as the specific weapons at issue were exempt from the reach of Local Law 5-2008. In any event, Local Law 5-2008 neither infringed on a preempted field nor was otherwise invalid by virtue of any conflict with existing state law enactments. The applicable portions of Local Law 5-2008 were not vague or ambiguous with respect to their particular and specific application to the weapons at issue, but instead, conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. The owners' alternative claim of facial invalidity similarly failed since when there existed at least one constitutional application of the statute. Local Law 5-2008 was not invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was denied and it was declared that the Local Law No. 5-2008 was not unconstitutional to the extent reviewed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of violating the open container law in violation of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., City Ordinance &sect; 14-19, which was punishable by up to six months in jail. He filed several motions, seeking various forms of relief. He challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, arguing, among other things, that if violated the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution in that its punishment was excessively harsh.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city court held that although an amendment to the ordinance could readily update the statute, which imposed a demode penalty, the authority to revise penalties did not rest with the city court, buy was within the sole discretion of the city's legislative body. It compared the penalty in other jurisdictions throughout the county and State for the same offense and found that the ordinance had an outmoded penalty disproportionate to the crime for which it was exacted and set forth a grossly excessive punishment that was irrationally severe. The ordinance's penalty became outmoded with the passage of time and the enactment of the Penal Law. The city court was bound to exercise judicial restraint and respect the separation of powers, leaving it to the local legislative body to evaluate if the punishment that evolved out of the enactment of the Penal Law was rationally related to the offense. The ordinance was not vague or ambiguous. It was specific and had exemptions and an applicability provision. The statute did not prohibit the possession of all alcohol in a public place but only possession with the intent to consume alcohol, and it particularized what public places it covered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city court denied defendant's request to dismiss the accusatory instrument, granted his request for discovery and inspection to the extent that there were unanswered discovery demands, denied his request to preclude the People from cross-examining him on prior criminal conviction and vicious or immoral acts but granted a Sandoval hearing upon the consent of the People, and granted his request for Molineux relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Cruel and Unusual Punishment -- Disproportionate Penalty -- Open Container Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's challenge to a municipal open container law on the ground that its allegedly disproportionate penalty violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments was denied in light of the fact that a New York penal sanction has never been struck down on the grounds of disproportionality. The statute--classified as a violation--provided a penalty of six months' incarceration, three months more than a class B misdemeanor offense. Not only was the penalty greater than that imposed for arguably more serious offenses, it was greater than that imposed by neighboring municipalities for the same offense. Nevertheless, although the penalty was inordinately disproportionate to the offense and outmoded in light of the sentencing structure of the Penal Law, which was enacted the year after the municipal law, the court was bound to exercise judicial restraint and respect the separation of powers, leaving it to the local legislative body to set the appropriate penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Open Container Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's constitutional challenge to the validity of a municipal open container law was denied. There was no actual or threatened injury that the defendant advanced which gave him a demonstrated constitutional right to drink alcohol in public places. Moreover, the right of municipalities to regulate the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public has been recognized in New York State. This right is underscored by a municipality's right to regulate the use of municipal property and enact ordinances that tend to preserve good order, peace, health, and the safety and welfare of its inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Open Container Law -- Vagueness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A municipal open container law which stated that &quot;[n]o person shall have in his or her possession any open container containing an alcoholic beverage in any public place with the intent to consume the same in such public place&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute included exemptions and an applicability provision, and it specifically defined public place as &quot;includ[ing] all areas of the public parks of the City . . . such areas designated by the city as picnic areas, golf courses, highways, roads, streets, sidewalks and publicly owned and maintained malls.&quot; The reasonable regulation of the possession of alcoholic beverages is not unconstitutional; only where a statute outright proscribes the possession of a container of alcohol has it been deemed unconstitutional on the basis that it failed to bear a reasonable relation to the public good, because if uniformly enforced, it would prohibit the acquisition of all alcoholic beverages for all purposes. The statute in question did not prohibit the possession of all alcohol in a public place, but only possession with the intent to consume the alcohol, and then the ordinance particularized which public places were covered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pistol permit applicant sought a hearing on the denial of her request to expand her sportswoman-residence pistol permit to an unrestricted and full carry permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant's initial request for an expansion of her gun permit was denied. At a hearing thereon, the applicant provided testimony in support of her application. It was noted that no representatives from any of the government agencies that were contacted appeared for the hearing. The applicant indicated that she felt afraid for her personal safety on two occasions while in public places. In one incident, a man appeared to be walking towards her in a mall parking lot but he moved in another direction before confronting her. In the other incident, a man in line behind her in a fast food restaurant said he was going to rob the place. However, he indicated that he was just kidding. The police were not called in either situation. The court acknowledged the right to possess a gun under U.S. Const. amend. II, but noted that such right had limitations. As the applicant did not show sufficient circumstances to distinguish her need from those of the general public and she did not show a specific need for self protection distinguishable from that of the general community of persons engaged in the same business or profession, the full-carry permit was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the request for an expanded permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- Firearms -- Full Carry Permit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, who possessed a sportswoman-residence permit allowing her to possess a weapon in her home and for many sports-related undertakings, but sought to upgrade to a full carry permit because on two occasions she was in fear for her personal safety in public places, was not entitled to a full carry permit. The issuance of a pistol permit is a privilege subject to reasonable regulation, and in order to receive a full carry permit the applicant must show a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community or persons engaged in the same profession. Petitioner's two fearful encounters and her claim that she would feel more comfortable or secure with a full carry permit were not indicative of a special need, nor did they distinguish her &quot;need&quot; from any other citizen. Although the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">District of Columbia v Heller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (554 US 570, 128 S Ct 2783, 171 L Ed 2d 637 [2008]) struck down as unconstitutional a District of Columbia statute that totally banned handgun possession in the home, the Court also recognized that the individual right to bear arms is limited. Reasonable regulation by New York State of handgun possession survives that decision. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner grandparents filed an application for an order finding respondent adoptive mother in willful violation of a visitation order that granted the grandparents visitation rights with their grandchildren. The mother moved to vacate the visitation order, arguing that compelling the children to visit with the grandparents was no longer appropriate because visiting with them caused the children mental anguish and emotional pain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents' son and his wife were convicted of murdering the children's sibling. The children were present during the acts of violence committed against their deceased sibling and at least one of them was also a target of the abuse. The parental rights of the son and wife were terminated. The mother adopted the children. The grandparents were granted visitation with the children. The trial court held that although the grandparents proved that visitation did not occur pursuant to the visitation order, there was no willful violation on the part of the mother. The mother showed that it was no longer in the children's best interests to compel them to visit with their grandparents against their wishes and that there had been a sufficient change in circumstances to terminate compulsory visitation. The evidence demonstrated that the grandparents' presence triggered very painful memories for the children. While the grandparents genuinely loved the children and wanted to be a part of their lives, their desire to have a relationship with the children was far outweighed by the psychological harm and emotional turmoil caused to the children when they were forced to attend visits.</SPAN></P>

Although almost three years had elapsed since implementation of the visitation order, petitioners' presence continued to trigger very painful memories for the children, whose father had been convicted of murdering their sibling, and had also abused at least one of the children. Petitioners' love for the children and desire to have a relationship with them was far outweighed by the psychological harm and emotional turmoil caused to the children that resulted when they were forced to attend visits. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ultimately, plaintiff sought a declaration that Tax Law &sect; 471-e governed plaintiff's obligation to pay or collect on the cigarette taxes at issue and, therefore, by virtue of exemption as a qualified reservation, it had not evaded or avoided the payment of the tax in violation of Tax Law &sect; 1814. By motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiff also sought the return of its property seized under a search warrant. The court addressed which of plaintiff's claims were cognizable in a declaratory proceeding and held that plaintiff had not established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. The court held that plaintiff was not a qualified reservation within the meaning of Tax Law &sect; 470(16), Tax Law &sect; 471-e, nor 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1151(a), to avoid imposition of the tax. The court further rejected plaintiff's attempt to forbear criminal prosecution, noting that the policy of forbearance by the New York Department of Taxation and Finance with regard to criminal prosecution under Tax Law &sect; 471-e could not circumscribe defendants' authority to investigate and determine whether criminal charges under Tax Law &sect; 1814 should be brought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Agriculture and Markets Law&sect; 353, a class A misdemeanor, for allegedly refusing to provide medical care for his dog for a prominent mass protruding from her rear end, which subsequently required surgery and six days of intensive care. Defendant moved for dismissal, challenging both the sufficiency of the complaint and the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint was signed by a Humane Law Officer of the ASPCA. She observed a 2-year-old female dog who was underfed and had a prolapsed vagina extending from the rear end. Defendant stated he owned the dog, knew the dog had a mass on the rear end and would not take the dog to the vet. As the dog had not received medical attention, the dog required surgery and six days of intensive care. The court held that allegations that defendant's lack of care caused the dog to suffer needlessly, though perhaps not complete enough to sustain a conviction, were sufficient to establish a prima facie case of Agriculture and Markets Law&sect; 353. Defendant's argument that the ASPCA intervened while he was attempting to arrange for a vet to come to his premises and examine the dog related to credibility and was an argument for trial. Nor did defendant show additional compelling reasons why the case should be dismissed. Defendant failed to meet his burden that the continuation of the case would result in fundamental injustice, so as to require dismissal under CPL 170.40. Defendant was informed of the prohibited activity and the statute contained provisions to allow the question of justification to be considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animals - Cruelty to Animals - Failure to Provide Medical Care to Sick Dog </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution alleging that defendant violated Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353, which broadly prohibits cruelty to animals, when he failed to provide medical care for his sick dog, the complaint was facially sufficient where it alleged that defendant knew that the dog had a mass requiring surgery and would not bring her to the veterinarian, and that eventually surgery followed by six days of intensive care was required. The provision of the statute that applied to defendant's conduct was not the failure to provide proper &quot;sustenance,&quot; but rather &quot;further[ing] any act of cruelty to any animal, or any act tending to produce such cruelty.&quot; Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 350 (2) defines cruelty as &quot;every act, omission, or neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted,&quot; and defendant was alleged to have neglected his dog to such a degree as to cause it to suffer needlessly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animals - Cruelty to Animals - Dismissal in Interests of Justice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A motion to dismiss in the interests of justice a prosecution alleging that defendant violated Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353, which broadly prohibits cruelty to animals, when he failed to provide medical care for his sick dog, was denied. Although defendant asserted that he was otherwise a good pet owner, that he had no criminal history, that punishing him would not be socially beneficial, and that no one should be prosecuted for failing to provide expensive medical care for an abandoned animal that became sick without any fault on the part of its adoptive owner, the prosecution maintained that the seriousness of the offense and the resulting harm were great, that defendant admitted to knowing about the dog's condition and refusing to seek treatment, and that once defendant assumed responsibility for the animal he became responsible for her care. Accordingly, inasmuch as defendant's contentions raised factual issues best decided by a trier of fact, dismissal in the interests of justice was unwarranted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animals - Cruelty to Animals - Constitutional Vagueness Challenge </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353, which broadly prohibits cruelty to animals, is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Statutes prohibiting cruelty to animals do not prohibit causing pain to animals, but only causing &quot;unjustifiable&quot; pain, and an act is considered justifiable where its purpose is reasonable and the suffering not disproportionate to the desired end. Whether the prosecution can prove that defendant, who allegedly so neglected a dog that it eventually required expensive surgery and extensive care, unjustifiably committed those acts was a matter best left to the trier of fact based upon the moral standards of the community. Accordingly, defendant was amply informed of the prohibited activity and the statute contained provisions to allow the questions of justification to be considered. Insofar as defendant conceded that he knew about the dog's condition for at least a week and had attempted to have a veterinarian visit the premises, but refused to take the dog to a veterinarian, it cannot be said that the statute was arbitrarily enforced with regard to his conduct. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prosecution for the prohibited possession of a firearm under ECL 11-0931(2), defendant moved to suppress a weapon that was seized from his automobile. Defendant claimed that an inventory search of his vehicle was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over by the police for loud music blaring from his car and a broken taillight. The officer issued two appearance traffic tickets for violation of the excessive vehicle sound ordinance, Rochester, N.Y., City Code &sect; 75-12(A), and the vehicle rear light statute,&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 375(2)(a)(3). Although the officer did not intend to take defendant into custody, &sect; 75-12(C) required that the vehicle be towed; therefore, the officer performed an inventory search and found a loaded shotgun in the trunk. The court granted the motion to suppress. While the initial stop was lawful, the impoundment was unconstitutional as no probable cause of criminality existed and the vehicle's seizure did not serve a valid community caretaking function. Defendant was able to drive the vehicle as he had a valid driver's license, and the location of the vehicle did not jeopardize public safety or impede the efficient movement of traffic. Defendant did not exhibit any suspicious behavior, and no contraband was in open view. The existence of &sect; 75-12(A) did not transform the seizure into a constitutionally permissible seizure and was, thus, unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The impoundment and search of defendant's automobile based solely upon the fact that defendant was ticketed for violating an excessive vehicle sound ordinance was unconstitutional. Absent a search warrant, the police may constitutionally impound a vehicle only where probable cause of criminality exists, or where the vehicle's seizure serves a valid community caretaking function. The two prerequisites for a constitutionally reasonable vehicle impoundment, outside of a criminal investigation, include the need to remove the vehicle to further public safety or the unimpeded flow of traffic, and the defendant's inability to provide for the vehicle's immediate and efficient removal. When the police officer here stopped defendant for two traffic infractions, he had no basis to believe that either defendant or the vehicle was involved in criminal activity, and he had no constitutionally legitimate community caretaking reason to impound defendant's car. Defendant had a valid license and was physically capable of driving the car, which was neither disabled nor impeding vehicular or pedestrian traffic.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner worker sought benefits from respondent insurer for a work site injury. The worker also settled a third-party action against respondent owner of the site where the injury occurred. The worker and the insurer sought a judicial determination of the amount of the lien to be enforced against the settlement under Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 29(1), and of the insurer's obligation to make future payments to the worker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker obtained a $ 600,000 settlement from the owner on the third party claim. The cost-of-litigation percentage was 21.56. The worker argued that the lien should have been limited because the $ 600,000 tort settlement represented only 24 percent of the counsel-estimated $ 2.5 million &quot;full value&quot; of the injured worker's case against the tortfeasor and the further fact that only 22 percent of the settlement proceeds included elements of damages for which the injured worker had been compensated by the insurer. The court disagreed. Pursuant to &sect; 29(1), a compensation carrier was entitled to enforce its lien against the proceeds of any recovery from a third party, and the lien was enforceable against the entire amount of the recovery or settlement, albeit after subtraction of attorneys' fees and litigation costs. The funds to which the lien attached properly included sums for pain and suffering or other elements of damages not covered by workers' compensation. However, any portion of the settlement for loss of consortium was not subject to the lien, and the court found that it was appropriate to ascribe 10 percent of the settlement, $ 60,000, to that claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker's petition was denied and the insurer's cross motion was granted. Among other things, the worker was ordered to pay the insurer $ 151,566 as its statutory net lien, with interest. In the case of weekly payments and qualifying medical reimbursements, the insurer was ordered to make payments at the rate of 21.56 percent of what such payments otherwise would have been, until its $ 259,100 credit was exhausted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Carrier's Lien -- Reduction of Lien Based on Equitable Considerations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, a severely injured worker who received workers' compensation benefits from respondent and was awarded future benefits, was not entitled to a reduction in respondent's lien asserted against petitioner's third-party tort settlement based upon equitable considerations otherwise applicable to Medicaid liens under federal law. Under New York's workers' compensation scheme (Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 29), the workers' compensation carrier is granted a lien against the full amount of any recovery or settlement in the third-party action, after subtraction of attorneys' fees and other litigation costs, regardless of whether the action may have been settled by the injured worker for less than its &quot;full value&quot; or whether the settlement included pain and suffering or other elements not covered by workers' compensation. The Legislature has deemed the lien provision to be an appropriate cost-containment measure in order to balance the goal of protecting injured workers against the necessity of protecting the legitimate business and economic interests of employers and their workers' compensation insurers. It would thus require legislative action to change the statutory scheme to allow for the reduction of the carrier's lien based on equitable considerations. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him for storing a boat on his property; defendant claimed that Webster, N.Y., Town Code &sect; 225-46 was unconstitutional due to vagueness because it did not define the word &quot;store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of &sect; 225-46 for parking a boat and trailer in his front yard. Defendant did not deny that his boat and trailer were parked in his front yard on his driveway from time to time. However, he argued that the word &quot;stored&quot; would imply a long term placement of the trailer and boat. The court found that &sect; 225-46 would certainly not seem to prohibit the temporary parking of a boat and trailer. But that begged the question as to when the temporary parking of a boat and trailer on one's property turned into the act of storing said property in violation of the ordinance. The practical intent of &sect; 225-46 was more relevant to a long term rather than a short term placement. Since it would appear that reasonable persons could disagree as to what constituted storage, defendant established beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 225-46 was unconstitutionally vague, because it failed to establish an objective standard as to what would constitute storage. It thus violated the due process provisions of both U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal trespass in the second degree under Penal Law &sect; 140.15, criminal trespass in the third degree under Penal Law &sect; 140.10(a), and trespass under Penal Law &sect; 140.05 by way of a misdemeanor complaint. He filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it had never been converted into an information because it was facially insufficient under CPL 100.15 and 100.40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that under all of the trespass counts charged, a defendant had to be shown to &quot;enter or remain unlawfully&quot; in or upon the premises. Here, although defendant's own admissions established that he was not licensed or privileged to enter or remain as a tenant of the building, the People had to establish through nonhearsay evidence that he was not upon the premises as a guest of a tenant. The deponent's statement that he could not locate anyone in an apartment who could verify defendant's claim that he was visiting in a fifth-floor apartment was hearsay, which had to be &quot;cured&quot; by a supporting deposition. This had not been done; thus, the complaint had not been converted to an accusatory instrument upon which an individual could be prosecuted. The court declined to follow a decision of the Appellate Term that upheld the facial sufficiency of a similarly worded complaint. It stated that the Appellate Term had failed to address the hearsay issue. Moreover, the court stated, the opinions of the Appellate Term were not binding upon it, but were merely persuasive authority, and the judgments and orders of the present court were not subject to review by the Appellate Term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendant for trespassing in an apartment building, the misdemeanor complaint alleging that defendant claimed to have been visiting a particular apartment, but that &quot;deponent could not locate anyone in the apartment who could verify defendant's claim,&quot; was facially insufficient. The deponent's statement that the occupants could not verify defendant's claim was hearsay, and it was not cured by a supporting deposition.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a trespassing prosecution in which defendant challenged the facial sufficiency of the misdemeanor complaint, an Appellate Term decision upholding a Supreme Court order that confirmed the facial sufficiency of a similarly phrased complaint was not binding upon the Bronx County Supreme Court. New York Constitution, article VI, &sect; 8 establishes the authority of the Appellate Division and Appellate Term, specifically reserving review of the cases decided by the Supreme Court to the Appellate Division only. Although the Supreme Court and Criminal Court in Bronx County were recently merged into the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, and the Chief Administrative Judge placed judicial review of Supreme Court decisions in misdemeanor cases in the Appellate Term (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rules of Chief Admin of Cts [22 NYCRR] &sect;142.3), that was an invalid and unconstitutional transfer of judicial review exceeding the scope of the authority of the Chief Administrative Judge and violating the express terms of CPL 450.60, which mandates that an appeal from an order of the Supreme Court be heard in the Appellate Division. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a hybrid CPLR art. 78 proceeding and action for declaratory and injunctive relief  petitioner medical laboratory sought a judgment, inter alia, declaring that Suffolk County, N.Y. Local Law 4-1993 (Suffolk County, N.Y. Administrative Code &sect; A4-13) was illegal, invalid, null and void because it violated General Municipal Law &sect;&sect; 100-a and 104-b(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed its action after respondent county awarded a medical laboratory services contract to respondent laboratory. The contract did not violate the competitive bidding requirements of General Municipal Law &sect; 103, because as a contract for specialized services, it was governed by the provisions of General Municipal Law &sect; 104-b. Contrary to petitioner's claims, Local Law 4-1993 was not inconsistent with &sect; 104-b. The state had not preempted the entire field regarding local public contracts that were not required to be competitively bid such as the instant contract. As the Local Law 4-1993 was valid, the court was required to uphold the county's decision regarding the award of the contract so long as it was in accord with the law and had a rational basis. The record supported the county's determination that respondent laboratory's proposal was superior to that of the other proposers, including petitioner. The court's decision rendered petitioner's claim for injunctive relief moot. The petitioner's remaining claims were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared Local Law 4-1993 to be valid, dismissed petitioner's claims under CPLR art. 78, and dismissed petitioner's claims for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Bids and Bidders -- Validity of Local Preference Law in Award of Public Contracts Not Subject to Competitive Bidding Requirements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A medical laboratory services contract awarded by respondent Suffolk County in accordance with the County's local preference law was not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful. The local preference law, which requires that the County's consulting contracts for specialized personal or professional services not otherwise subject to statutory competitive bidding requirements, as here (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Municipal Law &sect; 103), be awarded to individuals or entities located within Nassau or Suffolk County when practical in order to promote local economic activity on Long Island, was not invalid as being inconsistent with General Municipal Law &sect; 104-b. That statute, which applies to public contracts for goods and services not subject to competitive bidding requirements, affords localities discretion to formulate their own procedures and policies for the award of contracts which are in their &quot;best interests.&quot; As such, the statute does not manifest an intent by the State to preempt the entire field regarding local public contracts which are not required to be competitively bid. The Suffolk County Legislature clearly articulated the socioeconomic benefits of the local preference law to the residents of Suffolk County. Consequently, the local law constituted a valid exercise of the County Legislature's powers and was thus not void as unconstitutional or illegal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owners brought an action against respondent assessors, challenging a tax assessment on their property. The owners sought an order granting partial summary judgment. The assessors also moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The previously-existing home on the property was replaced by a new and larger home, which retained only the foundation of the previous house, but which was expanded, and two walls of the original home which were re-framed. The owners argued that any assessment should have only taken into account the value of new improvements. The assessor, however, found that this was construction of a new and improved home, and reassessed the property by consideration of both the nature of the construction and the property's then market value. The court found that the owners showed that the work done was an improvement to an existing structure, and not new construction. The owners, however, failed to show the proper equalized value of the improvements. A letter submitted was conclusory in its estimate of how much was spent for the construction, and lacked any schedule of costs, materials, labor, or other calculations that defined the fair market costs of the improvements. Material fact issues did not exist as to whether the alterations and additions made to the premises were new construction, but did exist as to whether the alterations and additions were of the equalized value asserted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' motion for partial summary judgment was granted only on the issue of selective reassessment, and the 2006 and 2007 assessments were declared invalid and void. The case was remitted for a new assessment for 2006 and 2007, which was to be determined by taking the prior assessment and adding to same only the equalized value of the improvements to the property. The assessors' cross-motion for summary judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Selective Reassessment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding challenging the new assessment of petitioners' property that was based on its market value rather than adding the equalized value of the improvements to the prior assessment, petitioners were entitled to partial summary judgment as a matter of law on the issue of selective reassessment. Petitioners demolished and removed all but the foundation and portions of two of the walls of the original house on their property and constructed a new house that was more than double in size. An already improved property may only be reassessed, in the absence of a municipality-wide reassessment, as part of a comprehensive plan and based on the cost of improvements made to the property. Here, petitioners demonstrated that the work done to the home consisted of an improvement to an existing structure, albeit one that gutted and substantially doubled the square footage of the residence, and not new construction. Nor was there a comprehensive, municipality-wide plan for reassessment upon improvements in place. Petitioners, however, were not entitled to partial summary judgment as a matter of law on the issue of the proper equalized value of those improvements, as the evidence offered regarding the amount of money spent on construction lacked any schedule of costs, materials, labor or other calculations that would have appropriately defined what were the fair market costs of the improvements to the property. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owners filed an action, which the court deemed a special proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78, seeking a judgment declaring that a condemnation of their property was unauthorized, was null and void, and invalid. Respondent, the Power Authority of the State of New York, proceeded under an exemption of EDPL 206(D) in acquiring the property at issue for use for a power plant under an emergency situation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners had been leasing the property to a power company, the lessee. The lessee had contracted with respondent and turned over all of its authority with regard to the power company operations and property to respondent. In turn, respondent commenced its efforts to acquire the property out right. The emergency situation alleged by respondent was the need for construction of a fast-track power plant to be operational by July 1, 2005. The public interest or public use was the need to meet the energy demand on a particular area. Petitioners disputed the validity of both reasons for the emergency situation. The court found that from the time respondent came on board, they intended to acquire the entire property. Significantly, the court found the testimony of four witnesses with many years of service in the power industry that respondent only acquired property for a power plant once compelling. The court held that respondent's acquisition of the property was not for a public purpose but principally conferred a private benefit by eliminating the power company lessee's obligation to pay rent under the lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition, in part, by declaring that the condemnation of petitioners' property was not for public use and set the acquisition of the property by respondent aside.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent New York State Power Authority was enjoined from condemning petitioners' property for the construction of a &quot;fast-track&quot; power plant on Long Island by way of an &quot;emergency&quot; condemnation proceeding that was not subject to the ordinary acquisition procedures (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;EDPL 206 [D]) where respondent failed to demonstrate a public need to acquire the property. Petitioners had already leased the property to the developer for a 35-year period for the purpose of constructing and operating a power plant, and the Long Island Power Authority had entered into an agreement with the developer to purchase the facility's electric generating capacity in accordance with the public request for proposal (RFP) it had issued. Under these circumstances, respondent's acquisition was not for a public purpose, but principally conferred a private benefit by eliminating the developer's obligation to pay rent under the lease. Respondent otherwise failed to demonstrate its need for fee ownership of the property, especially in view of the fact that the RFP expressly allowed for site control of the power plant by either fee ownership or a land lease. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, Governor and same-sex couple, filed motions to dismiss petitioner taxpayers' challenge to an executive directive by the Governor that recognized same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions; the couple also filed a motion to intervene as respondents to protect their interests in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers maintained that the Directive's implementation would inevitably cause the expenditure of state funds through same-sex spouses' eligibility for insurance benefits, other benefits, and financial assistance to the needy, for which only one partner previously was eligible. Accordingly, they claimed that it exceeded the Governor's lawful authority. The court found, inter alia, that even assuming an expenditure of state funds caused by the Directive's implementation, the Directive was entirely lawful. The Directive, requiring state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages legally solemnized in other jurisdictions was consistent with New York's common law, New York State Finance Law &sect; 123-b, Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 12, 15(1)(a), Executive Law &sect; 296, and N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same-Sex Marriage -- Validity of Executive Directive Requiring State Agencies to Recognize Same-Sex Marriages Legally Performed in Other Jurisdictions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor's May 14, 2008 executive directive requiring state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages legally solemnized in other jurisdictions for a full range of statutory and regulatory purposes is consistent with New York's common law, statutory law and constitutional separation of powers regarding recognition of marriages legally solemnized outside New York. Consequently, declaratory and injunctive relief was denied in a taxpayers' action pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b challenging the executive directive as having exceeded the Governor's lawful authority. The Governor's directive implementing New York's marriage recognition rule does not violate the separation of powers doctrine in the absence of legislative action specifically prohibiting recognition of same-sex marriages legally performed in other jurisdictions as authorized by federal law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">28 USC &sect; 1738C). Those marriages are not among the classes of marriages the Legislature has determined to be void or voidable (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 5-7). Furthermore, in view of the protections and benefits already extended to same-sex couples under New York law, it could not be said that the executive directive conflicts with New York's public policy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint against defendant arose from his response to a telephone call from his son's school principal. The principal had called defendant to indicate that his child was being suspended from school and defendant responded by indicating that the principal better &quot;watch it&quot; and that he was going to &quot;get&quot; her. In support of his motion to dismiss, defendant asserted that the complaint was facially insufficient, pursuant to CPL 170.30(1)(a) and 170.35(1)(a)-(b) as the allegation that he told the principal that he &quot;was going to get&quot; her was far too vague and remote to establish a prima facie case of harassment under Penal Law &sect; 240.30(1). The court agreed with defendant, finding that the complaint failed to allege a clear, unambiguous, and immediate threat. The court noted the brief nature of the telephone call and that, although it was not clear exactly what defendant intended, there was certainly no imminent threat of a specific physical harm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint charging defendant with two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree under Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) (a) and (b) for telling his son's principal, who had called defendant to advise him of his son's suspension, that, in substance, she had &quot;better watch it,&quot; and that he &quot;was going to get&quot; her, was facially insufficient. Penal Law &sect; 240.30 reaches only conduct intended to threaten or harass, such as threats which are unequivocal and specific, and communications which are directed to an unwilling recipient under circumstances wherein substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner. There were no allegations here that defendant issued an ultimatum threatening a specific type of harm which would befall the complainant at a predetermined time or place in the near future. Moreover, the complainant's privacy rights were not implicated as she telephoned defendant in her official capacity as school principal, defendant did not solicit the call, and defendant's response, while perhaps rude, was hardly shocking, and should not have alarmed an experienced school principal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a decision by the United States Supreme Court required a jury to make factual findings in order to elevate his sentence and that the decision overturned a New York Court of Appeals decision, which upheld the persistent felony offender sentencing statute. He claimed that his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury was violated when the trial judge held a hearing prior to sentencing instead of having the jury hear facts for elevation of his sentence to a persistent felony offender status. The supreme court held that the court of appeals decision remained good law. That decision was supported in the Appellate Division, First Department. The interpretation of constitutional questions by the federal courts were not binding on the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff indigents filed an action against defendant State, seeking a declaration that their constitutional rights were being violated due to systemic deficiencies in the manner of providing a defense to indigent individuals in five designated counties. They also sought injunctive relief requiring the State to provide a system of public defense in such counties. The State moved to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indigents had criminal charges pending against them in the counties. The State claimed that a declaratory judgment action could not be brought to challenge whether they were receiving effective assistance of counsel. The supreme court held that the indigents did not have an adequate remedy at law. They sought prospective relief based upon the likelihood that their constitutional rights would be violated. Their allegations illustrated their claims that the attorneys who represented indigent defendants in the counties were overworked and could not provide an appropriate defense. The indigents had standing to maintain the action. They were not seeking to assert the rights of third parties. Allegations of systemic deficiencies, which gave rise to a strong likelihood that the indigents' constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel would be violated, stated a justiciable cause of action. The counties were necessary parties. The complaint sought injunctive relief requiring criminal defense services to comply with constitutional and legal requirements, which, absent an amendment to County Law &sect; 722, would require the counties to fund significant increases in attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court conditionally denied the State's motion to dismiss. The indigents had to serve and file a second amended complaint adding the counties as parties defendant within 30 days. Unless the  indigents complied with the condition, the State's motion to dismiss would be granted in its entirety. In that event, the State could submit a proposed judgment on notice to the indigents, supported by an affirmation of such non-compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an assemblyman and former counsel, moved to dismiss plaintiff taxpayer's State Finance Law &sect; 123-b action for, inter alia, lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a cause of action, and/or lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought money damages from the assemblyman and his former chief legal counsel for the sum paid by the state in settlement of a sexual misconduct/harassment action filed by a female employee of the Assembly who was allegedly raped and sexually harassed by former counsel. The action was settled with the state paying $ 500,000 and former counsel paying $ 7,500. The taxpayer claimed that the settlement should have come from the pockets of the assemblyman and former counsel, and not from the taxpayers. The court found, inter alia, that there was no allegation that the assemblyman, in the course of his duties as the Assembly Speaker, caused the wrongful expenditure, misappropriation, misapplication, or any other illegal or unconstitutional disbursement of state funds. It was the Attorney General, who was required to defend that assemblyman, who agreed to the settlement pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 17(3)(b). The Attorney General's representation of the assemblyman did not entail the expenditure of public funds within the meaning of &sect; 123-b. Finally, former counsel was not represented by the Attorney General and was personally responsible for part of the settlement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State -- Taxpayer Actions -- Wrongful Expenditure of State Funds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A citizen taxpayer action pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b was dismissed pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7) for failure to state a cause of action where it sought restitution to the State from the Speaker of the New York State Assembly and his former chief legal counsel for the sum paid by the State in settlement of a prior sexual misconduct/harassment action brought by a female employee of the Assembly who was raped by the chief legal counsel following a work-related function outside the office. The complaint failed to allege any illegal or wrongful expenditure of state funds on the Speaker's behalf, even if the payment of damages could have been avoided had the Speaker terminated counsel's state employment prior to the rape based on his history of sexual harassment of female employees. In any event, it was the determination of the Attorney General, made pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 17 (3) (b), that the settlement of the action was in the best interests of the State, and plaintiff could not utilize a citizen taxpayer action to challenge the Attorney General's handling of civil litigation brought against the State and against a public officer in connection with his official duties. The Attorney General's representation of public officers does not entail the expenditure of public funds within the meaning of the State Finance Law nor did plaintiff allege any illegal or unconstitutional conduct in connection with the Attorney General's handling of the civil action. Furthermore, any judicial scrutiny of statutorily mandated nonfiscal activity of the Attorney General would be violative of the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately one year after the parties executed and recorded a separation agreement, the husband filed an action for divorce based upon conversion of the separation agreement. The wife claimed that the separation agreement was unenforceable because it was unconscionable and void because it was induced by misrepresentations. The court found that &sect; 177 could not be literally applied without causing an absurd result. Accordingly, the court created a notice that contained the requisite information about the availability of health insurance required by &sect; 177, and the parties executed it. As a result, the husband was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action for divorce and ancillary relief based upon the parties' separation agreement, which agreement was executed before the effective date of the statutory requirement that parties to a divorce action be made aware of the potential loss of health insurance coverage (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 177), plaintiff and defendant were required to execute a statement regarding their awareness of the potential loss of health insurance coverage as a prerequisite for being granted a conversion divorce. The statement, however, did not need to contain the exact language included in Domestic Relations Law &sect; 177 (1), as a literal application of the statute would lead to an absurd result. Rather, after notice regarding the potential loss was provided by the court to the parties as required by Domestic Relations Law &sect; 177 (2), it was sufficient to require them to recite slightly different language that satisfied the Legislature's intent. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners limited liability company (LLC) and its member brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding against respondents board and review commission, seeking an order vacating the decision of a hearing officer rendered at the conclusion of a small claims assessment review (SCAR) hearing pursuant to RPTL 730 which held that the SCAR provisions did not apply because the dwelling was owned by the LLC and thus was not &quot;owner occupied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The member was the sole organizer and member of the LLC, and there was no controversy that the property was the member's residence. The court found that the application for basic school tax assessment relief (STAR) benefits was denied without stating an explicit reason. The hearing officer's declination to consider the matter in a SCAR proceeding was without rational basis. RPTL 730 did not preclude consideration of homes whose title was held by an LLC. A CPLR art. 78 proceeding was an appropriate form for requesting relief. It would have been inappropriate for the court to determine the value of the subject premises on the limited record before it. The member and the LLC had the opportunity to seek review of the denial of their request for a basic school tax assessment relief exemption by the review commission, and therefore, failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The member and the LLC failed to demonstrate that an exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine was applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted to the extent that the matter was remanded to the review commission with a directive that it schedule a SCAR hearing as soon as practicable, and that such hearing be conducted by a different hearing officer. The portion of the petition which sought to compel a basic STAR exemption was denied, without prejudice to renewal upon a final determination of the review commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The refusal of the Hearing Officer in a small claims assessment review (SCAR) proceeding to entertain petitioner's application for a basic school tax assessment relief exemption (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 425 [3]) for his one-family home on the ground that the dwelling was not &quot;owner occupied&quot; as required pursuant to RPTL 730 (1) (b) because the record owner of the property was petitioner's single-member limited liability company (LLC) lacked a rational basis. The statute was intended to provide an expedited method for the review of assessments on one-, two- and three-family &quot;owner-occupied&quot; homes used exclusively for residential purposes. The statute does not preclude review in a SCAR proceeding merely because an LLC owns the property. Here, it was undisputed that petitioner used the home as his residence, and he was thus eligible, as the beneficial owner, to utilize the SCAR procedure.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Availability of STAR Exemption Where Limited Liability Company Holds Legal Title </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.

The statute was designed to provide school tax relief to owners of one-, two- and three-family homes by providing an exemption for a designated portion of the total assessment of their property. The statute does not preclude a STAR exemption merely because legal title to the property is held by an LLC.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Review of Denial of Application for STAR Exemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the denial of petitioner's application for a basic school tax assessment relief (STAR) exemption, the portion of the petition seeking to compel the respondents to grant a basic STAR exemption was dismissed due to petitioner's failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. Although the court held that the Hearing Officer improperly determined that the petitioner was disqualified from proceeding under the small claims assessment review provisions in seeking a STAR exemption, petitioner had the opportunity below to seek review of the denial of the exemption by the Assessment Review Commission, and could not demonstrate that further administrative proceedings would have been futile so as to avoid application of the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judges sued defendants governor, state senate, state assembly, and State, alleging that the judges had been improperly denied an increase in compensation in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The judges moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the senate had passed a bill providing for a judicial pay raise, a companion bill was never passed by the assembly, apparently based on the governor's threat to veto it unless the legislature also adopted a campaign finance reform proposal. In a prior decision, the court found that the assembly refused to pass a bill for a judicial pay raise that did not also contain a legislative salary increase. No affidavit denying the existence of this linkage was filed, so the court found that the judges' claim with respect to the linkage was established, and that the agreed adjustment in judicial pay had not been enacted only because there was no agreement with respect to a legislative pay raise. There was no open policy issue to be resolved as all parties agreed that the judiciary was entitled to an adjustment and the amount thereof. In denying the entire judicial branch of government a pay raise for almost a decade, the political branches of the State government had used the judicial pay issue as a pawn in dealing with the unresolved political issue of legislative compensation, and this linkage was an unconstitutional interference on the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges' summary judgment motion was granted to the extent of declaring that the governor, the state senate, the state assembly, and the State, through the practice of linkage, had unconstitutionally abused their power by depriving the judiciary of any increase in compensation for almost a decade, and by directing those parties to remedy such abuse by proceeding in good faith to adjust the compensation of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Disqualification -- Judicial Pay Increases -- Rule of Necessity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action brought by four judges of the Unified Court System seeking a declaration that the legislature unconstitutionally deprived the judiciary of a salary adjustment since 1998 due to linkage of the judicial pay issue to measures dealing with legislative compensation and other unrelated substantive matters could appropriately be heard by a randomly assigned Justice of the Supreme Court pursuant to the rule of necessity, even though the Justice could be financially affected by the outcome of the case. Under the well-recognized rule of necessity, the personal interest of a judge in a particular case will not result in disqualification if the case cannot be heard otherwise. Here, since the state constitutional issues raised in the action under the separation of powers doctrine cannot be determined in any other forum than the State Supreme Court, the rule of necessity required that the assigned Justice hear and determine the issues presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Constitutionality of Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation under Separation of Powers Doctrine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The refusal of the State Legislature to provide the judiciary with a salary adjustment since 1998 due to linkage of the judicial pay issue to measures dealing with legislative compensation and other unrelated substantive matters constituted an abuse of power and unconstitutional interference with the independence of the judiciary under the separation of powers doctrine. The claim of linkage asserted by plaintiffs, four judges of the Unified Court System, was deemed to have been established for purposes of the motion for summary judgment due to the failure of any member of the Legislature or any executive official to submit an affidavit denying the existence of the linkage practice. It is the constitutional duty and the obligation of the Legislature, in order to insure the independence of the judicial branch of government, to provide compensation adequate in amount and commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the judges involved. Although plaintiffs did not allege any specific interference with their independence in the performance of their judicial duties, they did demonstrate that the denial of a judicial pay increase for almost a decade due to the practice of linkage adversely affected the entire judiciary and was otherwise repugnant to the State's tripartite form of government. At this point, the proper remedy was limited to a declaration of unconstitutionality with the expectation that defendants would take appropriate remedial action. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a limited liability company (LLC) and its president, were criminally charged with violating 1 RCNY 6-01(k) by permitting the dismantling of a crane without first submitting to the Department of Buildings the name of a licensed rigger and without the presence of a site safety coordinator. Defendants made a motion to dismiss on the basis that &sect; 6-01(k) and Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 26-248(a) were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants alternatively requested that a motion in limine be granted to enjoin the People from arguing at trial that the term &quot;climbing&quot; was encompassed within the concept of erection and dismantling; defendants also sought discovery and a ruling of preclusion under Sandoval. Upon consideration, a judicial hearing officer (JHO) recommended, inter alia, that defendants' motion to dismiss be denied. Because the provisions were meant to minimize or guard against each act of segmented erection, the JHO found that the raising of a crane, section by section by &quot;climbing,&quot; would encompass erection of that crane within the meaning of &sect; 6-01(k). No reasonable likelihood existed that defendants were left to speculate whether their conduct was prohibited as a lay person of ordinary intelligence would understand that when segments were being added to a crane, erection safeguards would apply; defendant should have had such an understanding based on the submission of several applications for approval of the use of cranes at the construction site. The JHO determined that the People responded properly to defendants' discovery demands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The JHO, inter alia, recommended that defendants' motion to dismiss be denied, concluded that the People had responded properly to defendants' discovery demands, and found that defendants' Sandoval motion was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a CPLR art. 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action, respondents, the State, its comptroller, and the office of the state comptroller, made a motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint by petitioners, charter schools and non-profit associations, seeking a declaration that the comptroller lacked authority to audit charter schools and a permanent injunction so that the comptroller could not conduct audits of charter schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners also sought a declaration that General Municipal Law &sect; 33(2) and Education Law &sect; 2854(1)(c) violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court denied respondents' motion for summary judgment, finding the statutory provisions unconstitutional. While respondents argued that the charter schools lacked capacity to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes, the charter schools did not constitute political or governmental subdivisions of the State and, thus, were not subject to the same prohibition as municipalities. The comptroller could not be assigned administrative duties, such as the auditing of charter schools, as the charter schools were independent, not-for-profit education corporations. The charter schools were analogized to public benefit corporations, which did not constitute political subdivisions for the purposes of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The fact that the charter schools received public funds did not transform them into political subdivisions of the State. The duty of auditing charter schools was not incidental to the comptroller's function of supervising the accounts of school districts as a school district was not required to approve a charter school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied respondents' motion for summary judgment. The court declared that General Municipal Law &sect; 33(2) and Education Law &sect; 2854(1)(c) violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 to the extent that such statutes authorized or directed the comptroller to audit charter schools and permanently enjoined the comptroller from conducting or attempting to conduct audits of the charter schools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties - Capacity to Sue - Challenge to Statutory Scheme Authorizing State Comptroller to Audit Charter Schools </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioners, charter schools incorporated by the Board of Regents as independent and autonomous education corporations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 852 [5-a]), had the legal capacity to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory scheme that authorizes the State Comptroller to audit charter schools (General Municipal Law &sect; 33 [2]; Education Law &sect; 2854 [1] [c]). Charter schools are not political or governmental subdivisions of the State and are thus not subject to the general rule precluding municipalities and other local governmental corporate entities from maintaining constitutional challenges against the State. Moreover, charter schools are expressly empowered &quot;to sue and be sued in all courts and to participate in actions and proceedings . . . in like cases as natural persons&quot; (N-PCL 202 [a] [2]), a grant of authority that encompasses the prosecution of constitutional claims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Challenge to Statutory Scheme Authorizing State Comptroller to Audit Charter Schools </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioners, charter schools incorporated by the Board of Regents as independent and autonomous education corporations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 2852 [5-a]), had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory scheme that authorizes the State Comptroller to audit charter schools (General Municipal Law &sect; 33 [2]; Education Law &sect; 2854 [1] [c]). Petitioners fall within the zone of interest protected by article V, &sect; 1 of the New York State Constitution, which expressly limits the Legislature's power to assign to the Comptroller any administrative duties, except as may be &quot;incidental&quot; to the performance of the Comptroller's core function of supervising the accounts of the State and its &quot;political subdivisions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State -- Comptroller -- Power to Audit Charter Schools </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Respondent State Comptroller lacks the authority under article V, &sect; 1 of the New York State Constitution to conduct audits of charter schools. Charter schools are incorporated by the Board of Regents as independent and autonomous education corporations, even though they are considered &quot;public schools&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 2852 [5-a]), and are thus not &quot;political subdivisions&quot; of the State subject to the Comptroller's fiscal oversight. Consequently, the statutory scheme that authorizes the State Comptroller to audit charter schools (General Municipal Law &sect; 33 [2]; Education Law &sect; 2854 [1] [c]) is violative of article V, &sect; 1, which, in setting forth the Comptroller's broad responsibility to superintend the State's finances, expressly limits the Legislature's power to assign to the Comptroller any administrative duties, except as may be &quot;incidental&quot; to the performance of the Comptroller's constitutionally authorized functions. The duty of auditing charter schools cannot be deemed to be &quot;incidental&quot; to the Comptroller's core function of supervising the accounts of the State and its &quot;political subdivisions.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint charging him, inter alia, with second-degree and aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a child, violations of Penal Law &sect;&sect; 240.30(1)(a), (b), 240.26, 260.10; defendant claimed that the complaint was insufficient to sustain the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendant, age 18, sent the complainant, age 14, an unspecified number of messages through the Myspace website, essentially stating defendant's love for the complainant. The complaint also alleged that defendant was repeatedly asked to leave the complainant's house by her father, and that he had to be physically removed from the property. The messages and defendant's statements at the complainant's home allegedly caused the complainant and her father to fear defendant, and/or to become alarmed and annoyed. The court found, inter alia, that the complaint did not allege that the messages were intended to threaten, incite alarm, or harass. No threat of physical contact, genuine or otherwise, was alleged. The mere allegations that defendant told the complainant that she should not listen to her parents and should go with him, without more, were insufficient to establish endangering the welfare of a child. Consequently, the complaint was insufficient to support the counts of second-degree and aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a child under Penal Law &sect;&sect; 240.30(1)(a), (b), 240.26, 260.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Harassment -- Teenager's Love Messages Sent to 14-Year-Old Complainant Via Social Networking Web Site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 18-year-old defendant could not be charged with aggravated harassment (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]) for having merely sent messages to the 14-year-old complainant through a social networking Web site expressing his unrequited love for her, in the absence of any allegation that the messages were intended to threaten, incite alarm or harass. In order to be constitutional, the harassment statute must be strictly construed to reach only conduct intended to threaten or harass, such as specific threats or intolerable invasions of privacy. Communications that are merely unpleasant or disagreeable are protected by the First Amendment and do not fall within the statute's scope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harassment -- Teenager's Attempt to Get 14-Year-Old Complainant to Run Away with Him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 18-year-old defendant could not be charged with harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.26) for having merely gone to the 14-year-old complainant's home, expressed his love for her and urged her to run away with him, in the absence of any allegations that defendant intended to threaten harm. While defendant stated that he would not leave complainant alone, there is nothing in the accusatory instrument to indicate that defendant intended this to be a threat, or anything more than a declaration of his affection for complainant, even over the objections of her parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The 18-year-old defendant could not be charged with endangering the welfare of a child (Penal Law &sect; 260.10) for having sent messages to the 14-year-old complainant through a social networking Web site expressing his unrequited love for her and then going to complainant's home and urging her to run away with him over the objections of her parents, in the absence of any allegations that defendant's conduct was likely to endanger complainant's physical or moral welfare. A teenager's misguided and clumsy attempts to woo another teenager do not constitute endangering the welfare of a child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by a police officer on a public sidewalk pushing a cart containing piping. When defendant was unable to produce a bill of sale for or other proper proof of ownership or right to possession of the materials, he was arrested for violating &sect; 10-118. The court found that &sect; 10-118 required no further allegations than those already contained in the complaint: that defendant was transporting piping, and was unable to produce either proof of ownership or right to possess the materials. Although perhaps not complete enough to sustain a conviction, the allegations in the complaint were sufficient. The regulation did not create an irrebuttable presumption that the materials were stolen. The only presumption created by the regulation was that the materials were likely unlawfully removed from a building or construction site at some point in time. The regulation provided a means of overcoming the presumption by presenting proof of ownership or authorization. Consequently, defendant failed to meet his burden to show that the regulation was constitutionally voidable for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An accusatory instrument charging defendant with violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting the transportation of building materials without proof of ownership or right to possession thereof (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-118 [b]) based upon the sworn allegations of the arresting officer that he observed defendant &quot;pushing a cart containing piping&quot; on the sidewalk and that defendant was &quot;unable to produce a bill of sale for or other proper proof of ownership or right to possession&quot; of the materials was facially sufficient for pleading purposes without the need for an additional allegation that defendant unlawfully removed the materials from a construction site or structure. In order to sustain a charge under the ordinance, the allegations in the accusatory instrument were only required to establish that defendant was transporting piping along a public street without proof of ownership or authorization to possess those materials. The ordinance does not require further allegations that the building materials were actually removed from a building.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Destruction or Removal of Property in Buildings or Structures -- Municipal Ordinance Proscribing Transportation of Building Materials on Public Street without License Not Invalid under Irrebuttable Presumption Doctrine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant could lawfully be prosecuted for violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting the transportation of building materials without proof of ownership or right to possession thereof (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-118 [b]) based upon the sworn allegations of the arresting officer that he observed defendant &quot;pushing a cart containing piping&quot; on the sidewalk and that defendant was unable to provide proof of ownership or authorization to possess those materials. The statute, which was intended to deter the removal of property from construction sites, does not create an impermissible irrebuttable presumption that individuals who transport building materials stole those materials from building sites so as to violate defendant's right to due process. Rather, the only permissible presumption created by the statute is that where loose fragments of buildings are carried or carted about the city, such materials were likely unlawfully removed from a building or construction site at some point in time. The statute provides a means of overcoming this presumption by presenting proof of ownership or authorization.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Destruction or Removal of Property in Buildings or Structures -- Transportation of Building Materials on Public Street without License Not Unlawful Strict Liability Offense</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The statute, which was intended to deter the removal of property from construction sites, cannot be construed as an unlawful strict liability offense for the crime of theft, since the substantive conduct punished by the statute is not theft, but transporting materials without a license.  </SPAN></P>

The statute is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, since it provides adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. Defendant's conduct fell squarely within the clear wording of the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs claimed that the Department's policy memorandum, which recognized as spouses the parties to certain same-sex marriages, violated the constitutional principal of separation of powers, violated State Finance Law &sect; 123-b, violated N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8, art. IV, &sect; 8, and State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 202. The plaintiffs also argued that under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the Department should be prohibited from arguing that the term &quot;spouse,&quot; as used in Civil Service Law &sect; 164, included partners of same-sex couples who were married outside New York. The court found, inter alia, that because the action was not the same as a prior case, the doctrine of judicial estoppel did not apply. The other arguments offered by plaintiffs to invalidate the determination were without merit. In the absence of a contrary holding, recognition of legally performed foreign same-sex marriages was appropriate. The policy memorandum provided an interpretative statement of the term &quot;spouse&quot; as it related to eligibility for health plan benefits. As such, it did not violate the separation of powers, improperly use public funds, or constitute an improper unified rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to intervene was granted, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was denied, and summary judgment was granted to the defendants and the intervenors; the policy memorandum was declared to be both lawful and within the Department's authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner agency filed a civil management petition to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that defendant was a sex offender requiring civil management pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.6(g).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was evaluated by a psychiatrist to determine whether he was a sex offender with a mental abnormality requiring civil management. The psychiatrist reviewed the case review team's report and defendant's hospital psychiatric records, analyzed defendant's contacts with the criminal justice system and sex offender treatment documents, and interviewed defendant. She concluded that defendant suffered from a mental abnormality and was at high-risk to commit sex offenses. The court found that the psychiatrist's credible opinion as to defendant's personality disorder with antisocial features was amply supported by defendant's criminal history, medical and therapy reports, as well as his evaluation. Consequently, there was probable cause to believe that defendant suffered from a mental abnormality. The court was of the opinion that a probability of dangerousness was contained in its initial finding of probable cause. Confining defendant to his home would not be adequate to protect the public. Consequently, because lesser conditions of supervision would not suffice, pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect;&sect; 10.03(q), 10.06(g), defendant was to be committed during the pendency of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted, defendant's application to be examined by a psychiatrist was granted, and trial was to commence upon completion of the examination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- &quot;Probable Cause&quot; Hearing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner established through the testimony of its expert witness in a proceeding under the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act that there was &quot;probable cause&quot; to believe that respondent, a detained sex offender eligible for conditional release to parole supervision, was a high-risk sex offender with a mental abnormality requiring civil management (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 [g]) who must be confined during the pendency of the proceeding. In determining whether &quot;probable cause&quot; exists, it is the synthesis of all the information about the respondent, including the antisocial traits, disorders and expert opinion as to the mental abnormality, rather than simply a specifically classified disorder as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, that the court is mandated to consider. Here, the expert's credible opinion as to respondent's personality disorder with antisocial features was sufficiently supported by respondent's history of predatory sexual behavior, his psychiatric records and the expert's evaluation of him. Furthermore, once respondent was found to suffer from a mental abnormality at the &quot;probable cause&quot; phase of the proceeding, an independent finding of dangerousness was not required for the purpose of determining the necessity of his pretrial confinement. The &quot;probability&quot; of dangerousness is inherent in the definition of mental abnormality. It is only at the dispositional phase of the proceeding that the court is required to make a separate finding of dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.07 [f]). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees' managing agent timely submitted license renewal applications concerning the licensees' parking garages. He claimed that the DCA refused to accept the applications and denied them without explanation. The DCA's letter determination delineated the following bases of its determination: outstanding fines, judgments, and flagrant refusal to abide by DCA rules and judicial orders. The DCA's counsel admitted at the oral argument that she had instructed the licensing department to deny all license applications for companies related to the managing agent. The court found, inter alia, that the DCA's decision was not arbitrary or capricious, and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. There were ample bases in the record to support the DCA's denial of the licensees' license renewal applications. Consequently, the denial was not disproportionate nor shocking to the court's conscience. Although a finding of &quot;good character&quot; was part of the DCA's licensing scheme, Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 20-321(b) was not a factor in its determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges for second-degree aggravated harassment under Penal Law &sect; 240.30(1A), (1B) that were filed against him; defendant claimed that the charges were facially insufficient, and that the statute was unconstitutional as applied since his speech was constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sent approximately six text messages within 17 hours to the complainant's phone that stated he was outside of her residence and that she would end up in the hospital. The court found that defendant's culpability, if any, arose from his harassing conduct, not from any expression entitled to constitutional protection. The allegations in the information, if true, were not merely irritating or abusive, but threatening and would understandably have caused the complainant to be fearful for her life. The brevity of the text messages had no impact on the severity of their meaning. Consequently, the factual allegations in the complaint were sufficient to support the charges for second-degree aggravated harassment under &sect; 240.30(1A), (1B).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Harassment -- Threatening Text Messages</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An accusatory instrument charging defendant with two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1] [a], [b]) based upon allegations that he sent six threatening text messages to complainant's phone in less than 17 hours stating that he was outside of her residence and that she would end up in the hospital was facially sufficient to support the charges. Defendant's unwanted communication with complainant did not constitute constitutionally protected speech. Defendant's culpability would arise from his harassing conduct, not from any expression entitled to constitutional protection. The issue of whether the substance of defendant's text messages conveyed a genuine threat to complainant within the meaning of the statute was a question of fact for the jury to determine. Furthermore, defendant's contention that text messages are not as serious as phone calls, letters or e-mails lacked merit. Text messages are communicated in writing, just like letters or e-mails, and access the recipient often instantaneously, like a phone call directly to the person's cell phone. In addition, the brevity of a text message has no impact on the severity of its meaning. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the governor, the state assembly, the state senate, and the State, moved to dismiss pursuant to CPLR &sect; 3211(a)(7) a complaint filed by plaintiffs, two family court judges, a city civil court judge, and a city criminal court judge, alleging that they had been improperly denied an increase in compensation since 1999 in violation of separation of powers and N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a), the no-diminution clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several legislative measures had been introduced to increase the judiciary's compensation but had not passed into law due to, inter alia, the governor's objection to the inclusion of an increase in the salary of legislators. Although the New York state constitution did not expressly mandate a separation of powers, the principle was included by implication. The court determined that based on the circumstances, an issue existed as to whether the executive and legislative branches had abused their power and unconstitutionally interfered with the judiciary's independence. No allegation of the impairment of the independence of the judicial branch had to be made to establish a constitutional violation by defendants. Because inflation affected everyone, allegations that only asserted a failure to increase judicial salaries for nine years did not state a viable claim for a violation of the no-diminution clause. The action against the governor had to be dismissed based on a common-law immunity, similar to that under N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 11, the speech and debate clause, which applied to members of the executive branch, such as the governor, when they performed legislative functions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the governor's motion to dismiss the action as against him. The court granted the motion to dismiss as to the remaining defendants as to the first cause of action claiming a violation of the no-diminution clause and denied the motion as the second cause of action claiming a violation of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Constitutionality of Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The failure of the State Legislature to provide for a pay adjustment to state-paid judges of the Unified Court System to offset the effects of inflation and increased cost of living since the last increase in judicial compensation in 1999 stated a viable constitutional claim for breach of the separation of powers doctrine. Plaintiffs' allegations in their declaratory judgment action that all the parties in the legislative process agree upon the need to provide the judiciary with the compensation adjustment but that no action has been taken because of political infighting involving the attempted linkage of judicial and legislative pay adjustments with the enactment of campaign finance reform were sufficient to raise an issue as to whether defendants abused their power and thus unconstitutionally interfered with the independence of the judiciary. However, defendants' failure to adjust judges' compensation cannot be deemed to be violative of the constitutional prohibition against the diminution of judicial compensation (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]). The decrease in the economic value of the salaries paid to judges over the past nine years because of the impact of inflation has not had a particularized discriminatory impact on judges different from that upon any other persons who did not receive a salary increase during that period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- Immunity from Suit -- Constitutional Challenge to Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Governor was not a proper party defendant in a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the Legislature's failure to provide for a pay adjustment to state-paid judges of the Unified Court System to offset the effects of inflation and increased cost of living since the last increase in judicial compensation in 1999. The remaining defendants, the State of New York, the Senate and the Assembly, are proper parties, and the dismissal of the action against the Governor would not be a bar to the declaratory relief sought. Furthermore, the Governor would be immune from suit under NY Constitution, art III, &sect; 11 to the extent that plaintiffs sought to require the Governor to engage in a &quot;legislative function&quot; by signing a legislative enactment increasing judicial compensation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State filed a petition seeking a probable cause determination that respondent inmate was a sex offender requiring civil management pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law art. 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on probation for the gang rape/sodomy of a 12-year-old, the inmate raped and sexually abused a 19-year-old female. A licensed psychologist reviewed the inmate's history and interviewed him. The psychologist found that the inmate suffered from a mental abnormality that predisposed him to reoffend sexually. In addition, the inmate declined to have any involvement in sex offender treatment, and his lifestyle plans lacked the specificity requisite to a relapse prevention plan. The court found probable cause under Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06(g), (k) to believe that the inmate was an individual requiring civil management. The psychologist's testimony clearly established the necessity of continued confinement during the pendency of the proceeding. Therefore, pursuant to Correction Law &sect; 500-a(1)(f), the inmate was to be confined at a county correctional center during the pendency of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a probable cause hearing under the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 [g]), petitioner established that there was reasonable cause to believe that respondent, who was convicted in 1981 of raping and sexually abusing a 19-year-old woman whom he had picked up and offered to drive to a train station while he was on parole for his 1975 conviction for the gang rape/sodomy of a 12 year old, was a sex offender requiring civil management upon the completion of his sentence. The conclusion of petitioner's expert that respondent suffered from a mental abnormality which predisposed him to committing another sexual offense and that he would pose a danger to the community if released was based upon such factors as respondent's criminal sexual offense history, his mental health treatment, disciplinary history and his lack of any realistic lifestyle plan if he were released into the community. Furthermore, petitioner demonstrated that respondent should be confined in the county jail (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 500-a [1] [f]) pending the outcome of the trial. Lesser conditions of supervision would not suffice to protect the public during the pendency of the proceeding. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Presentment Agency filed a petition pursuant to Family Ct Act &sect; 343.1(4) and CPL 65.20 declaring that a five-year-old victim in a juvenile delinquency proceeding was a &quot;vulnerable witness&quot; whose testimony at the fact-finding hearing should be taken by means of live, two-way closed-circuit television.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was sexually molested by respondent juvenile, her 14-year-old god-brother. Thereafter, the victim developed symptoms that were consistent with an acute traumatic reaction. She related her concern that if she saw the juvenile in the future, he would do it again, and that she would be scared if she had to tell her story in court in his presence. The court determined that the victim was competent to be sworn as a witness in the prospective fact-finding hearing. Based upon the information obtained during the evaluative process, it determined that the victim should be considered a vulnerable witness in accordance with Family Ct Act &sect; 343.1(4). It was likely that the victim would suffer serious mental or emotional harm that would impair her ability to give testimony before the court if required to testify at trial in the juvenile's presence. Therefore, pursuant to CPL 65.10(1), 65.20(2), the use of live, two-way closed-circuit television pursuant to CPL 60.30 would diminish the likelihood or extent of such harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion was granted, and the testimony of the vulnerable child witness could be taken by means of live two-way closed-circuit television.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Witnesses -- Use of Closed-Circuit Television of Child Witnesses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a juvenile delinquency proceeding based upon allegations that the 14 1/2-year-old respondent committed sex offenses against a five-year-old girl, petitioner presentment agency demonstrated by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that the child victim should be declared to be a &quot;vulnerable witness&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 343.1 [4]; CPL 65.20) who would testify at the fact-finding hearing from a testimonial room separate and apart from the courtroom by means of live, two-way closed-circuit television. The &quot;vulnerable witness&quot; statute was satisfied by petitioner's showing through its expert that the child victim would suffer &quot;serious&quot; mental or emotional harm that would impair her ability to give testimony before the court if she were required to testify in respondent's physical presence in the courtroom, especially in view of the long-standing family-like relationship respondent had with the victim and her family. The statutory scheme authorizing the use of live, two-way closed circuit television as a method of permitting certain child witnesses to give testimony in sex crime cases furthers the aim of insulating those child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in open court without violating the constitutional right of confrontation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After counts alleging that defendant acted recklessly in aiming a loaded firearm toward a crowd of people were withdrawn, defendant pleaded guilty to the remaining counts in the indictment. The trial court noted, prior to accepting the guilty plea, that it could not promise what defendant's sentence would be. The People subsequently filed a violent predicate felony conviction statement which alleged that defendant was convicted of attempted assault upon a police officer. Based on that statement, to which defendant did not object, defendant was sentenced as a predicate violent felony offender. Defendant claimed that the predicate conviction was based on a jurisdictionally defective superior court information. Upon consideration, the court granted defendant's motion. With respect to the predicate conviction, after a felony complaint was filed and defendant executed a waiver of indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted assault on a police officer under Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00 and 120.08. However, the information improperly charged a nonexistent crime as one could not have a specific intent to cause an unintended crime and was, thus, defective under CPL 195.20.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant was entitled to an order setting aside his sentence as a second violent felony offender, as his predicate violent felony convictions for two counts of attempted assault on a police officer were based on a jurisdictionally defective superior court information. In the prior prosecution defendant had been charged by felony complaint with attempted aggravated assault upon a police officer, but the superior court information to which he pleaded guilty contained two counts of attempted assault on a police officer. The offense he pleaded guilty to was not the same as, or a lesser included offense of, the offense for which he had been held for action of a grand jury (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 195.20). The element of intent with respect to the crime of aggravated assault upon a police officer relates to the causing of physical injury, while the element of intent with respect to the crime of attempted assault of a police officer relates not to the causing of physical injury, but to the circumstances which make that result one for which defendant is strictly liable. As the lesser crime requires demonstration of an element not required by the greater, it is not a lesser included offense. Moreover, there is no express authorization for a superior court information to charge a nonexistent crime, and an attempt to commit the crime of assault on a police officer is a nonexistent crime, as one cannot have a specific intent to cause an unintended crime. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the applicant's first application was denied, the parties agreed it would submit a new one, which was also denied. The first denial said the applicant did not have a certificate of occupancy and questioned the accuracy of a residence address in the application. The certificate of occupancy was obtained and the address was explained, but respondents said the applicant was not of good character. The statute was unconstitutionally vague because it was unknown what conduct the applicant had to demonstrate to satisfy respondents it was &quot;of good character.&quot; The words &quot;good&quot; and &quot;character&quot; were susceptible of multiple and varied meanings. A lack of interpretive statutory or regulatory provisions relegated enforcers and applicants to these two words. This was so imprecise that it was as if no standard of conduct was specified at all. The &quot;good character&quot; requirement did not distinguish between conduct that was permissible and impermissible in understandable terms with which an applicant could comply, so the denial was invalid.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A municipal licensing statute authorizing the granting of licenses to operate a parking garage only to persons of &quot;good character&quot; (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-321 [b]) is unconstitutionally vague on its face, as it lacks any ascertainable standards in the statute or the implementing regulations (6 RCNY 2-161) for evaluating a license applicant. The absence of objective standards as to what conduct an applicant must demonstrate to satisfy the &quot;good character&quot; condition creates the possibility of arbitrary and discriminatory denial of licenses by conferring unrestrained power on agency officials to consider conduct of poor character based merely on their own personal, subjective notions of &quot;good character&quot; unrelated to the applicant's fitness to operate a parking garage. The statute thus allows unfettered, arbitrary administrative decision making without a standard to enable judicial review. </SPAN></P>
