VIII because the prohibition of life-without-parole sentences in Graham did not apply to aggregate term-of-years sentences involving multiple crimes; [2]-Defendants were properly convicted of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny while armed with a deadly weapon at the time of entry, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-91, because the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's possessed a knife at the time of their entry into the victim's townhouse. One of the defendants admitted to possession of a knife at that time, in one of the two backpacks used by defendants, while the other defendant stated that he also had a little knife in his jacket at the time of the break-in.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, a sex offender had pled guilty to carnal knowledge of a minor. He later sued the Commonwealth, contending that the legislature's reclassification of this offense as &quot;sexually violent offense&quot; violated his contractual and constitutional rights. The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia, granted summary judgment to the Commonwealth. The offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the offender was convicted, carnal knowledge of a minor was classified as a non-violent sex offense. After an amendment to Va. Code Ann &sect; 9.1-902, his conviction was retroactively reclassified as a &quot;sexually violent offense,&quot; and he became subject to more stringent registration requirements. He argued that his plea agreement was a contract that incorporated the sex offender registration laws in existence at the time of the agreement, and that the Commonwealth violated his rights under Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 1-239 by amending the registration laws and retroactively enforcing them against him. The high court disagreed. The reclassification of the crime was an exercise of the state's regulatory police power and not a breach of contract. As he had no vested contractual rights with respect to the registration requirements in effect when he entered into his plea agreement, the subsequent reclassification of his conviction was not an unconstitutional taking under art. I, &sect; 11. Nor was it a violation of procedural due process, as convicted sex offenders had no fundamental right to rely on the civil legislative scheme in existence at the time of pleading guilty.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the Circuit Court of Henrico County (Virginia) found that appellant was a danger to himself as of the date of the initial detention order and denied the appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was detained on March 19 and involuntarily committed the next day. He was released; his appeal was heard in May. The court held that although appellant had been released, he was subject to collateral consequences because the trial court's ruling allowed the initial commitment order from the special justice to remain intact. Therefore, the appeal was not moot. The court held that the clear language of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 37.2-821 required a de novo hearing, and this required not a review of the district court's decision but a decision as to whether grounds existed for the original involuntary commitment on the date of the circuit court hearing of the de novo appeal. Because the Commonwealth conceded that the evidence was insufficient to commit appellant as of the date of the circuit court hearing, dismissal of the Commonwealth's petition for involuntary commitment was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a church diocese and a national church, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, including a congregation. The Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, ordered the congregation to transfer its real and personal property to the church. The congregation appealed. The church appealed the trial court's application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-7.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-7.1 broadened the scope of denominational trusts in Virginia. It validated transfers of real and personal property that were made to or for the benefit of any church, church diocese, religious congregation or religious society, including a hierarchical church. Any express trust created by the Dennis Canon was ineffective. However, a constructive trust was imposed as the Dennis Canon reflected the implicit trust relationship between the local parishes and dioceses. The congregation's attempt to withdraw from the diocese and the national church and still maintain its property violated its fiduciary obligation to the diocese and the national church. The dispute was resolved in a wholly secular manner through the use of neutral principles of law, and the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, was not violated. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-15 did not apply and was not violated. A constructive trust was imposed on the personal property of the congregation. The congregation's proof of its congregants' donative intent was insufficient. The trial court erred in awarding the diocese and the national church more property than they requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed with regard to the &sect; 57-7.1 analysis and as to the disposition of the personal property acquired after the congregation disaffiliated from the church. A constructive trust was imposed in favor of the church on the remainder of the property. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the City of Portsmouth (Virginia) in a declaratory judgment action. The circuit court ruled that plaintiff failed to establish that a certain card game was not illegal gambling under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-325 and that Va.

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the father and mother's written agreement, as authorized by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-49.1(B)(2), the child was conceived by in vitro fertilization, using the mother's eggs and the father's sperm. The parents, who were in a long term relationship but never married, executed an agreement providing the father with reasonable visitation rights. After the child's birth, the parents executed an acknowledgement of the father's paternity and listed him as the father on the birth certificate. The mother argued he could not be the child's legal parent because he never married her and the child was conceived through assisted conception. The high court disagreed. As the parents lived together, jointly assumed rights and responsibilities, and voluntarily executed a statutorily prescribed acknowledgement of paternity, the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV protected the father's fundamental right to make decisions concerning the child's care, custody and control, despite his status as an unmarried sperm donor. Thus, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20-158(A)(3) and 32.1-257(D) did bar him from establishing legal parentage pursuant to a written agreement as authorized by  &sect; 20-49.1(B)(2)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in preventing defendant from asking specific members of the jury venire whether they had strong feelings in favor of the death penalty, what their views about the death penalty were, or whether they would consider a life sentence in the absence of mitigating evidence, as defendant did elicit the information sought and the trial court explained the relevant legal principles and asked appropriate questions to ensure that the jurors understood those principles. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to strike evidence on the count for capital murder in the commission of abduction with the intent to defile, as the beating the victim 47 times with a blunt object was not a manner of effectuating a capital murder in the commission of a rape or attempted rape and thus, the evidence was sufficient to establish capital murder in the commission of abduction with the intent to defile separately and apart from, and not merely incidental to, capital murder in the commission of a rape or attempted rape. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on voluntarily intoxication, as evidence of general alcohol abuse was irrelevant in the guilt phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied respondent's motion to be permitted to attend the assessment hearing. Instead, he appeared by video conference; his counsel was present in court.  Respondent argued that this procedure violated his rights to counsel and to due process, as well as his rights under &sect; 37.2-901, because there was no adequate means for him and his counsel to confer privately during the hearing. The high court disagreed. The provision in &sect; 37.2-910(A) for conducting annual assessment hearings under the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 37.2-900 et seq., by video conference was neither unconstitutional facially nor unconstitutional as applied in respondent's case. He was not prejudiced by not being able to attend the hearing, as he and counsel were able to see and speak to one another; to see and hear the trial judge, opposing counsel, and the witnesses; and to cross-examine a doctor. Neither respondent nor his counsel indicated that they could not follow the proceedings, nor was any request made for a private communication to be made between them. Finally, there was no evidence that conducting the hearing by video conference was impracticable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A university sued a corporation for breach of contract. Initially, the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Virginia) entered a default judgment in favor of the university. Later, the trial court set aside the order of default judgment. The university appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the university's affidavit for substituted service was defective because it identified as the corporation's last known address only one of the two addresses contained in the contract and that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-329(B) required the university to identify both the corporation's physical and post office box addresses as its last known address. The appellate court disagreed. The language of &sect; 8.01-329(B) reflected a legislative intent to serve process at a single address, not multiple addresses. The record showed that the corporation received mail at the post office box, that the university mailed correspondence by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the corporation at that address, that both the corporation's president and general manager received or signed the certification of mailing accompanying correspondence from the university, and that the corporation used both the post office box and the physical address during its contractual relationship with the university. This demonstrated that the address the university identified on the affidavit was reasonably calculated to provide notice to the corporation and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the court of appeals erred in substituting a dictionary definition of &quot;obscene&quot; for that provided by the general assembly in Va.

The general assembly provided a definition of &quot;obscene&quot; in &sect; 18.2-372 to comport with constitutional requirements. There was no suggestion that the definition was constitutionally infirm. Although the definition of &quot;obscene&quot; applied to Article 5, Obscenity and Related Offenses, of Chapter 8, Crimes Involving Morals and Decency, of Title 18.2 of the Virginia Code, the court of appeals had utilized the definition provided by &sect; 18.2-372 outside of Article 5 of Chapter 8 of the Code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division certified questions of law concerning whether Virginia recognized tortious interference with parental rights (TIPR) as a cause of action and, if so, what elements constituted such a tort. The matter arose in plaintiff father's action against defendants, an attorney and others, who were involved in the adoption of his child without his knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father and mother were unmarried when they had a child. Although they had made plans to raise their child together, the mother's parents retained an attorney to arrange for an adoption. Based on the attorney's advice, the mother made false statements to the father concerning the adoption proceeding. After the baby was adopted and custody was transferred to adoptive parents (APs) in Utah, the father initiated custody proceedings. He was awarded custody in Virginia, but the Utah courts awarded custody to the APs. The father filed a federal court action against the attorney and others, based on the unauthorized adoption. A motion to dismiss a claim of TIPR was denied pending a response to certified questions as to that cause of action. The court found that the tort in question had existed at common law and continued to exist today. The court concluded that the common law right to establish and maintain a relationship with one's child necessarily implied a cause of action for interference with that right. It noted the elements of such a tort, as well as some of the available defenses and the applicable burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal as of right, defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which imposed two death sentences against him following his conviction by a jury on two capital murder counts as well as convictions for rape, grand larceny, and two counts of felonious use of a firearm. On remand, a jury unanimously found sufficient grounds for the imposition of the death penalty under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to recuse himself from the case because the record did not support defendant's allegation that the judge entirely discounted his mitigating evidence as he offered no evidence or even allegation of extrajudicial influence that would suggest bias. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial or bar subsequent testimony from the sister of one of the murder/rape victims because no reasonable juror could conclude from the sister's testimony that she was attempting to implicate defendant in her own rape that occurred years prior in any way and the trial judge promptly, explicitly and carefully instructed the jury to disregard the inappropriate testimony that the sister made that her rapist got away with the crime. The court also found no error with regard to the trial court allowing a particular doctor as the Commonwealth's mental health expert under Va. Code. Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.3:1(F) since he satisfied the professional requirements for appointment and defendant presented no evidence that would have supported disqualifying him.</SPAN></P>

The county challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 33.1-221.1:1.1 in authorizing funding to the railroad for the facility's development under the terms of the agreement. The supreme court affirmed. The funding for the facility under the Agreement was authorized pursuant to legislation intended to be directly related to the construction, maintenance and operation of Virginia's highways. Therefore, the statute's application did not violate the internal improvements clause under Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 10 because it came within the public roads exception.

The production of documents did not resolve all of the issues raised in this appeal, namely, whether the requestor was entitled to recover fees and costs, and there was an actual controversy. However, the legislature did not intend the VFOIA to apply to the SCC. The SCC was governed by a separate and parallel structure of laws and was not a &quot;public body&quot; under the VFOIA.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the authority of appellee, a county board of supervisors, to regulate the construction of additional mooring slips and accompanying piers that would lie beyond the mean low-water mark of a creek.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner operated a marina. It planned to develop additional mooring slips with accompanying piers and submitted a special exception permit application. The board denied the permit. The supreme court held that the circuit court did not err in concluding that the county's zoning authority embraced the entirety of the landowner's proposed construction, even the portion that extended into the Chesapeake Bay's tidal tributaries, i.e., creek, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-3105. The regulatory authority granted the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) did not preclude, but rather contemplated, that VMRC and a locality would have concurrent authority to regulate the construction of piers upon state-owned bottomlands where the pier was also erected along the waterfront of the locality. The circuit court did not err in holding that Northumberland County, Va., Land Subd. and Dev. Ordinance &sect; 148-138(A) was not invalid for failure to state standards to be applied by the board in the issuance of a special exception permit. Because the county reserved unto itself the power to issue conditional use permits, it was performing a legislative function when it granted or denied such permits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner brought an action against appellee City following the demolition of his property. The property owner claimed deprivation of his due process rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, inverse condemnation, in violation of Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and common law property damages. The Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk (Virginia) dismissed the claims upon demurrer and pleas in bar. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City's demolition of the property was not a taking, but rather the abatement of a nuisance for which no compensation was due. Consequently, the property owner was not entitled to a post-deprivation hearing because there was no compensable taking. The trial court, therefore, erred in sustaining the demurrer to the due process count on that basis. However, that error was harmless. Further, the property owner's constitutional due process rights to notice and opportunity to object were not violated by any deficiencies in his notice letter. During the 107 days that elapsed from receipt of the notice until demolition, the property owner made no inquiries about his appeal rights and took no actions to avail himself thereof. The property owner's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies barred any claim for inverse condemnation under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-187. Finally, the City was immune for exercising its police power to abate the public nuisance that it deemed the property owner's building to pose. Furthermore, the demolition of the building entailed the exercise of the City's discretionary authority and, therefore, the City enjoyed sovereign immunity for its actions.</SPAN></P>

Next, petitioner's claims that he was denied effective assistance satisfied neither the performance nor the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.

Petitioner also failed to establish either an actual conflict of interest or an adverse effect on counsel's performance. Further, the record, including the trial transcript, written jury instructions, and verdict forms, demonstrates that the jury was properly instructed. Petitioner's assertions of actual innocence were governed by Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.2-327.1 to -327.6, -327.10 to -327.14, and were outside the scope of habeas corpus review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) of five counts of capital murder in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(4), (7), (8), (12). Defendant was sentenced to death on two counts and life on the remaining three counts. The convictions and sentences were upheld on appeal. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus. Respondent warden filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner satisfied the performance and prejudice prongs of the Strickland test by showing that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to protect petitioner's rights to be free from double jeopardy. Petitioner was tried and punished for separate counts of capital murder of more than one person as part of the same transaction under &sect; 18.2-31(7) and capital murder of more than one person within a three-year period under &sect; 18.2-31(8), even though the crimes arose from the same criminal act and one punishment was for a crime which was a lesser included offense of the other. There was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's failure to raise this issue at trial, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to proceed to sentencing on only one of the two indictments. Therefore, petitioner was granted a writ of habeas corpus as to his life sentences imposed under &sect; 18.2-31(7) and (8). As to the remaining convictions, petitioner failed to demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient or that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ in part and dismissed it in part. The court remanded the convictions under &sect; 18.2-31(7) and (8) and directed the trial court to exercise its discretion to vacate on of the underlying convictions.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court subsequently imposed the punishment fixed by the jury. The Court of Appeals of Virginia upheld the circuit court's denial of defendant's motion for nonjury sentencing, and affirmed his conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-269.1, charges against defendant, then sixteen years of age, for aggravated malicious wounding, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-51.2(A), and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-53.1, were certified to a grand jury. The grand jury indicted defendant for these offenses and also for participation in an act of violence in association with a criminal street gang, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-46.2. Defendant challenged the circuit court's allowing the jury to fix the sentence after the conviction. On appeal, the court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-272 did not apply to youthful offenders who fell within the scope of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-271. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-271 applied to any juvenile who was tried and convicted in a circuit court as an adult. On the other hand, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-272 applied in any case in which a juvenile was indicted. When defendant appeared before the circuit court for sentencing on the charges under review, he was not a juvenile. He had been previously convicted as an adult on an unrelated charge and given an adult sentence. Therefore, the jury was correctly allowed to sentence defendant on the three charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of child endangerment in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 40.1-103(A). The circuit court confirmed the jury's verdict and imposed $ 1500 in fines on defendant. Defendant filed a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals of Virginia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court had to consider whether the court of appeals erred in finding that three convictions for child endangerment in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 40.1-103(A) were supported by sufficient evidence that the defendant endangered the lives of her three children by permitting illegal drugs to be kept in her home in a place accessible to the children. The court found that in order to accept defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish the mens rea of criminal negligence, the court would have had to conclude that reasonable minds could not differ on whether rearing children in a home where illegal drugs were readily accessible may constitute endangering the children. The myriad factors to be considered in such cases, such as the children's ages, the length of the exposure, the level of supervision, and the quantity and variety of the drugs, suggested that as with most cases where criminal negligence was at issue, that determination was a fact-specific one best left to the jury. Considering the totality of the evidence, the court could not say that the jury's finding of criminal negligence was plainly wrong or without support in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases consolidated for appeal, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia) upheld the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 33.1-435 and 58.1-3221.3. A taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, a taxpayer brought an action against a County and its Board of Supervisors for refunds of taxes paid under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 33.1-435, 58.1-3221.3. The circuit court denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment, and granted the County's cross-motion. In the second case, the County's Economic Development Authority brought a complaint under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2650 concerning the validation of transportation district improvement revenue bonds, which were to be repaid by the proceeds of the tax levied pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33.1-435. The taxpayer intervened. The circuit court entered an order validating the bonds. The taxpayer failed to meet its burden of proving that no reasonable basis for the tax classifications in Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 33.1-435, 58.1-3221.3 could have been conceived. The fact that untaxed others would have benefited to some extent from the improvements funded by the taxes did not prove that there was no rational basis for the tax classifications approved by the General Assembly.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the Circuit Court of Prince William County (Virginia) were four capital murder convictions and death sentences imposed upon defendant for the murders of two victims, two pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(4), the third under &sect; 18.2-31(7), and the fourth under &sect; 18.2-31(8). Non-capital offenses had been consolidated with the mandatory review of the capital murder convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the imposition of the two death sentences upon defendant for convictions under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(7) and -31(8) violated the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense, as the Commonwealth was free to indict a defendant under &sect; 18.2-31(8) for the murder of more than one person within a three-year period when each of the constituent murders occurred as part of the same act or transaction, and also indict a defendant for capital murder under &sect; 18.2-31(7) for the same murders. However, if the Commonwealth obtained convictions on both indictments it could not seek to have separate punishments imposed for each offense, but rather it had to elect which indictment it would proceed upon in the penalty-determination phase of the trial. In addition, the circuit court erred in admitting a witness's victim impact testimony, as neither the witness nor her father was a victim of the capital murders for which defendant had been found guilty. The witness's testimony, by the Commonwealth's own admission at trial, was solely presented as victim impact testimony of unrelated and unadjudicated criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for capital murder and the other felony convictions and terms of imprisonment imposed thereon were affirmed. The four death sentences were vacated, and the case remanded for a new penalty-determination proceeding to be conducted consistent with the views expressed in the opinion on the convictions under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(4) and, at the Commonwealth's election, the conviction under either &sect; 18.2-31(7) or &sect; 18.2-31(8).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowners filed an action against a town, challenging the denial of a certificate of appropriateness (COA) application and their requests to withdraw their parcels from a historic district and seeking a declaratory judgment that the historic district ordinance, Vienna, Va., Town Code &sect;&sect; 18-258 to 18-280.13, was invalid. They challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which denied them relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that the historic district ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, was enacted in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2306 and Vienna, Va., Town Code &sect; 18-261. The supreme court held that the circuit court did not err in approving the town's denial of the COA and the requests to remove parcels from the historic district. It could not consider whether the underlying ordinance was invalid when considering an appeal from a governing board's denial of a COA. There was no error in the judgment of the circuit court upholding the ordinances as validly enacted. Considered together, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.1-503.2(a) and 15.1-430(b) (Supp. 1978) authorized a locality to create a historic district even if it contained no buildings or structures. Regardless of how specific the requirements of &sect; 18-261 requirements could have been when the town enacted the historic district, the landowners could not challenge that enactment. By its unambiguous terms, Va. Code Ann. Code &sect; 15.2-1427(C) barred all non-constitutional challenges to the adoption of ordinances existing at that time. The information required by the ordinance to render an application complete was not vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner claimed that the ordinance violated the provisions of Va. Code. Ann. &sect; 15.2-2282 and deprived him of equal protection under the law. The ordinance established difference building height regulations on one-family dwellings in the same zoning district. The court found that there was no dispute that the city uniformly applied its building height regulations for one-family dwellings on standard lots and uniformly applied its building height regulations for one-family dwellings on substandard lots. Under the ordinance the building height regulations for one-family dwellings on all substandard lots were applied identically, and those regulations for one-family dwellings on standard lots were applied identically. Thus, the ordinance did not violate the uniformity requirement of &sect; 15.2-2282. Furthermore, because the ordinance was not inherently suspect and did not infringe upon the exercise of a fundamental right, the court rejected the owner's assertion that it was facially discriminatory. Accordingly, the court concluded that the owner did not present sufficient evidence to show that the ordinance was unreasonable and, thus, failed to rebut the presumption of its validity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County (Virginia), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee property owner's action for declaratory relief involving the disapproval of the owner's preliminary subdivision application, which determined that Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect;&sect; 17-2 and 17-36 were void, and which required the county to approve the application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the circuit court erred when it ruled that Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect;&sect; 17-2 and 17-36(a) were void. The court found that Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect; 19-128(f) allowed one acre lots in the agricultural district, and that by imposing a five acre minimum lot size in the agricultural district through applications of Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect; 17-36(a) and the definitions of lot subdivision and residential parcel subdivision contained in Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect; 17-2, the county infringed upon the right to subdivide to a minimum one acre parcel of land in the agricultural district even though a residence on a one acre lot was a permitted use in owner's property's current agricultural zoning classification. Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect; 17-36(a), effectively rezoned the owner's property in a manner inconsistent with the uses permitted by the owner's agricultural zoning classification. The county was not permitted to use a subdivision ordinance to prohibit a use of the owner's property that was permitted by the property's zoning classification. Such error did not void Chesterfield, Va., County Code &sect;&sect; 17-2 and 17-36 in their entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner determined that for a specified period the company violated &sect; 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to supply certain high-demand models of vehicles imported by the company for distribution to the dealership. Upon review, the court determined that during the specified period, the company could not reasonably have understood from the language of the statute that its failure to ship any of the newly introduced high-demand models to the dealership would violate &sect; 46.2-1569(7), but learned this only after the fact from the result of an arbitrary exercise of discretion by an administrative official charged with enforcing the statute. In the absence of fair notice from the language of the statute or that the Commissioner would interpret the statute as prohibiting it from not shipping at least one of each requested vehicle model to the dealership in any month that it was capable of doing so, the company was denied its right to due process. The court held that &sect; 46.2-1569(7) was impermissibly vague as applied to the company and that the Commissioner's finding that the company was in violation of the statute had to be set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia refusing his petition for appeal of his conviction for abduction with intent to defile in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-48. The court of appeals held that defendant's failure to make either a motion to strike at the conclusion of all of the evidence or a motion to set aside the jury's verdict constituted a waiver of his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-384(A) abrogated or limited the waiver rule and, therefore, his motion to strike at the conclusion of the Commonwealth's evidence preserved the sufficiency issue for appeal. However, &sect; 8.01-384(A) did not apply to permit appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence based solely on defendant's motion to strike denied after the Commonwealth's case-in-chief because that motion was a separate and distinct motion from a motion to strike all the evidence, or a motion to set aside an unfavorable verdict, made after a defendant has elected to introduce evidence on his own behalf. By electing to introduce evidence in his defense, defendant demonstrated by his conduct his intent to abandon the argument that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden through the evidence presented in its case-in-chief. Thus, any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence after such waiver necessarily raised a new and distinct issue from the one presented by the denied motion to strike.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was previously convicted of capital murder, raised a claim of mental retardation in a habeas proceeding. The case was remanded to the Circuit Court of Shenandoah County (Virginia), pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-654.2. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the Commonwealth because defendant admitted that he lacked an expert witness on the issue of whether he was mentally retarded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the hearing on remand, defense counsel filed a motion to declare defendant incompetent and to secure treatment, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-169.2, to restore defendant to competence. The Commonwealth opposed the motion. The circuit court held that defendant's competence was irrelevant and refused to adjudicate his competence. However, the Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-654.2 hearing on remand to determine whether defendant was mentally retarded was criminal in nature. Therefore, defendant should have been afforded the same rights as those afforded to any defendant in a criminal sentencing proceeding. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in holding that defendant's competence was irrelevant and in refusing to adjudicate his competence. Further, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the Commonwealth because summary judgment was not available in the criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The judge's argument that she did not rule that the order was not appealable was implausible. The judge argued unsuccessfully that the Canons were unconstitutionally vague and without appropriately definite standards as applied to the facts in the complaint against her, and that vague and indefinite laws and regulations offended due process rights. Citing Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-913, the judge unsuccessfully argued that it was improper for the Commission to admit and consider evidence of her prior contacts with the Commission.

Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The circuit court found defendant guilty. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant did not challenge the lawfulness of the traffic stop or the fact that the police officer had probable cause to search the vehicle based on the positive alert by the narcotics detection dog. Thus, the only issue on appeal was whether, after the search of the vehicle and three of its four occupants revealed no contraband, the police officer then had probable cause to search defendant. The state supreme court found that probable cause to search defendant under the Fourth Amendment was absent. After the positive alert by the trained narcotics detection dog, the officer unquestionably had probable cause to search the vehicle. However, without something more, the positive alert did not provide probable cause sufficiently particularized as to defendant to allow the search of his person. The Commonwealth presented no evidence, other than defendant's status as a passenger in the vehicle, indicating that defendant and the other passengers were involved in any common enterprise involving criminal activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer, escape, use of a firearm in the commission of murder, and three counts of capital murder. After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Washington County, Virginia, defendant was found guilty of all charges. The jury found both the future dangerousness and vileness aggravating factors and sentenced defendant to death on all three capital murder convictions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the circuit court's errors resulted in the empaneling of jurors who were substantially impaired. The court found that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to strike a juror from the jury panel for cause because there was ample evidence to support the circuit court's finding that the juror's relationship with law enforcement personnel would not lead to an inability to be a fair and impartial juror. The circuit court also did not abuse its discretion when it granted the motion to exclude a juror for cause because there was sufficient evidence to support a holding by the circuit court that the juror be excluded from the jury &quot;for cause&quot; because of her views about the death penalty. Under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.2-264.2 and 19.2-264.4(C), to be admissible, evidence related to a prison environment had to connect the specific characteristics of the particular defendant to his future adaptability in the prison environment. Therefore, the expert's proposed testimony concerning prison life was inadmissible, and the lack of expert assistance did not result in a fundamentally unfair trial in violation of defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court did not err in denying his motion to bar a retrial and impose a life sentence, in not requiring that the issue of mental retardation be determined separately from the other sentencing issues in the second trial, or in bifurcating the sentencing phase to include a separate phase on mental retardation. The circuit court did not err in making four determinations relating to lost hair evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence to convict defendant as an immediate perpetrator. The sentencing phase verdict forms provided to the jury in the second trial were defective because they did not include a life without parole sentence option and they failed to explicitly set out the unanimity required in the jury finding of one or both of the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence of a prior capital murder conviction was admissible.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-585.1(A)(6), 56-580(D), and 56-46.1, a power company filed an application for approval, certification, and rate adjustment with regard to proposed a clean-coal powered electric generation facility. The State Corporation Commission of Virginia granted the application. Respondent citizen groups appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 56-585.1(A)(6) authorized a power company to petition the Commission for approval of a rate adjustment clause for recovery from customers of the costs of a coal-fueled generation facility that used Virginia coal. Respondents argued that as &sect; 56-585.1(A)(6) discriminated in favor of Virginia coal at the expense of out-of-state coal, it purported to permit what the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, declared unconstitutional. The high court disagreed. Section 56-585.1(A)(6) did not require--and the Commission did not order--that any amount of Virginia coal be used in the proposed coal-fired plant. What was required was that the technology of the proposed plant allowed it to burn coal found in Virginia. Consequently, the phrase &quot;utilizes Virginia coal&quot; was descriptive and not prescriptive in content. There was no prohibition upon importation and no economic burden imposed by a statutory scheme upon out-of-state producers that favored in-state suppliers. Additionally, even if provisions of &sect; 56-585.1(A)(6) were found to violate the Commerce Clause, severance of the allegedly impermissible language would save &sect; 56-585.1(A)(6) from invalidation.</SPAN></P>

The police officers testified that the city used two enforcement standards in evaluating noise: a &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard and an &quot;across the street&quot; assessment. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the ordinance prohibited, among other things, &quot;unreasonably loud, disturbing, and unnecessary noise.&quot; However, the provisions failed to give fair notice to citizens as required by the Due Process Clause, because the provisions did not contain ascertainable standards. The references in the ordinance to &quot;reasonable persons,&quot; and to persons of &quot;reasonable sensitivity,&quot; did not provide a degree of definiteness sufficient to save it from the owners' vagueness challenge. Because the determinations required by the ordinance could only be made by police officers on a subjective basis, the ordinance was impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the circumstances and actions observed by the officer were not enough to create a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. Viewing the totality of the circumstances objectively, even though it was 8:00 p.m. and there had been robberies and burglaries in the area, the circumstances did not supply a particularized and objective basis to suspect that defendant's observed behavior was a precursor to a break-in, robbery, or any other criminal activity on his part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was amenable to prosecution in Virginia because he knew and intended that e-mails sent to a provider's subscribers would use the provider's servers that were located in Virginia. Defendant had standing to raise the First Amendment overbreadth claim. Because e-mail transmission protocol required entry of an Internet provider (IP) address and domain name for a sender, the only way such a speaker could have published an anonymous e-mail was to enter a false IP address or domain name. Registered IP addresses and domain names discoverable through searchable data bases and registration documents resulted in a surrender of the speaker's anonymity.

By prohibiting false routing information in the dissemination of e-mails, &sect; 18.2-152.3:1 infringed on that protected right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of capital murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and grand larceny, found the aggravating factor of future dangerousness, and fixed his sentence at death for the capital murder charge and a combined 22 years in prison for the other charges. The Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk, Virginia, sentenced defendant in accordance with the jury's verdicts and entered judgment. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to declare the Commonwealth's lethal injection and electrocution methods for execution unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The supreme court disagreed. Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53.1-234, defendant had a choice between two methods of execution: electrocution and lethal injection. The supreme court had held that electrocution did not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and Virginia's lethal injection protocol was materially similar to that upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Baze. Defendant was thus precluded from choosing a method and then complaining about its constitutionality, particularly since the constitutionality of the alternative method had been established. Since the supreme court had previously determined that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.2 was not unconstitutionally vague, no additional instructions regarding the definition of &quot;probability&quot; were needed in order for the jury to properly understand and determine defendant's future dangerousness under the other instructions given in his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court, including the sentence of death, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Virginia General Assembly enacted a law, the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 56-576 et seq. (Act), to transition to retail competition for purchasing and selling electric energy. Under the Act, the Commission was to direct the functional separation of generation, retail transmission, and distribution of all incumbent electric utilities by a certain date. To accomplish the transition, each incumbent electric utility had to submit a plan to the Commission. Also under the Act, the Commission was ordered to establish &quot;capped rates&quot; for customers and had to establish such rates. The company's plan was to transfer its Virginia generating assets to its affiliate. To allow that, the Commission approved elimination of the company's fuel factor and capped the company's tariff rates through a certain date. The Commission dismissed the company's application to establish a levelized fuel factor tariff after that date and canceled a scheduled public evidentiary hearing. The state supreme court found that the Commission pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 56-582 could adjust capped rates as a matter of legislative discretion but did not have to do so as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In unrelated bench trials, three defendants were convicted of cocaine offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-187 permitted the admission into evidence of a certificate of analysis provided that it was filed with the clerk of the court seven days prior to trial. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-187.1 established a procedure for an accused to call as a witness the person who performed the analysis or any person in the chain of custody and examine them as an adverse witness, with all cost borne by the Commonwealth. The supreme court held that the statutory scheme set out a reasonable procedure to be followed in order to exercise defendants' right to confront a particular limited class of scientific witnesses at trial and that a defendant's failure to timely notify the Commonwealth of his desire to confront the forensic analyst at trial constituted a waiver of that right. The court held that defendants waived their Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right by declining to notify the Commonwealth to subpoena the analyst who prepared the certificate or by failing to subpoena the witness themselves and that the affirmative step that had to be taken under &sect; 19.2-187.1 in order to assert one's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arlington County Circuit Court (Virginia) held that bonds plaintiff local area transportation authority proposed to issue were valid, and certain taxes and fees it was authorized to impose under 2007 Va. Acts 896 to finance the bonds were constitutional. In so ruling, it dismissed a counterclaim, summary judgment motion, and responsive pleadings filed by defendants, a county and the citizens. The county and citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority instituted a bond validation action and requested, inter alia, that the trial court determine the validity of certain bonds the authority proposed to issue, and the constitutionality of certain taxes and fees the authority was authorized to impose, under 2007 Va. Acts 896, to finance the bonds. Both the county and the citizens opposed the validation. The trial court found that enactment of 2007 Va. Acts 896 was within the General Assembly's legislative power, and that the fees and taxes were valid. The state supreme court first ruled that 2007 Va. Acts 896 did not violate Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12, because the enactment's subjects all related to transportation. Next, it found that the General Assembly in 2007 Va. Acts 896 impermissibly delegated taxing power to the authority. It explained that Va. Const. art. I. &sect; 6 contemplated that taxes could only be imposed by a majority of elected representatives within a legislative body and could not be delegated to an unelected political subdivision such as the authority. As a result, it also found that the bonds could not be validated and that the invalid portions of the enactment were severed from the rest of it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the trial court's finding that the legislative enactment at issue did not violate the Virginia Constitution's &quot;single object rule.&quot; However, it reversed both the trial court's ruling that validated the proposed bonds and the trial court's judgment that the taxes and fees that the legislative enactment authorized the authority to impose were constitutional. It also entered final judgment according to its rulings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to a term of active imprisonment after the jury recommended a three-year sentence. Pursuant to Va.

Defendant challenged the term of postrelease supervision on appeal, but the appellate court upheld it. On further review, the state supreme court rejected defendant's claim that the appellate court should have found that the term of postrelease supervision under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2 violated his Sixth Amendment rights. The state supreme court explained that a trial court's authority to imposed postrelease supervision under that statute was separate from a jury's ability to recommend a sentence under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295, and that the trial court did not need to find any additional facts in order to impose the postrelease supervision under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2; rather, the determination that postrelease supervision was appropriate was based on the jury's conviction finding that defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter.

The supreme court disagreed, holding that the taking of defendant's DNA sample upon arrest was analogous to the taking of a suspect's fingerprints upon arrest and was not an unlawful search under the Fourth Amendment. The supreme court noted that the taking of the DNA sample was part of the routing booking process and no additional finding of individualized suspicion was required before the sample could be taken. Defendant also argued that his constitutional right to confrontation was violated upon admission of the certificate of analysis linking defendant to the victim's attack and the statutory presumption contained in Va.

The supreme court found no error, noting that the author of the certificate of analysis appeared at trial, testified as to its contents, and defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the author.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) that dismissed his sexual abuse complaint against defendant diocese with prejudice based on the statute of limitations in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-243(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff asserted that he had been sexually abused from 1962 to 1966, when he was between the ages of 10 and 14 years, by two priests employed and governed by the diocese. He alleged that he had not been aware, until 2002, that the severe mental, emotional, and physical injuries from which he suffered were the result of the sexual abuse. The state supreme court found that Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14, para. 4 empowered the General Assembly to remove the constitutionally protected right of a defendant to bar a cause of action only in cases where the defendant was a &quot;natural person.&quot; Because the diocese was not a &quot;natural person,&quot; the preexisting state of the law, as interpreted in Starnes, applied. Therefore, because Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-249(6) (1998) did not apply, the plaintiff's cause of action accrued when it occurred, not when it was discovered. Consequently, the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiff's action as untimely under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-243(A).</SPAN></P>

The victims, being under 18, were &quot;minors&quot; as defined by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 1-207. Nothing in Lawrence v. Texas or Martin v.

Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 17.1-313(C)(1) and (2), the supreme court reviewed the death sentences imposed upon defendant and found that there was no evidence that the jury or the trial court were influenced by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor in sentencing defendant to death, and that the death sentences were not excessive or disproportionate to the sentences of death imposed by other sentencing bodies in comparable cases with comparable defendants. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in concluding that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(12) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because &sect;&nbsp;18.2-31(12) exposed some murderers to the death penalty while protecting other similarly situated offenders from the death penalty. The supreme court disagreed, concluding that a rational basis existed for imposition of the death penalty on persons over the age of 21 who murdered a child, that such persons should have sufficient maturity and judgment to be held responsible for conduct which might be excusable in a younger person. Contrary to defendant's contention, rational basis, not strict scrutiny, was the proper standard of review for the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants hosted a party for their 16-year-old child at which alcoholic beverages were served. A police officer responded to a call reporting underage drinking and observed, after driving up the residence driveway, young people in the backyard with beer bottles in their hands. When the young people saw the officer, they began to flee. The officer then entered the backyard without a warrant and observed numerous empty alcohol bottles. Defendants contended that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment. The trial court and court of appeals disagreed. On further review, the court affirmed because it found that the officer had not passed the path leading to the front door when he saw juveniles in the backyard holding beer bottles. The officer acted with probable cause to enter the backyard, after having observed a crime in progress, and exigent circumstances justified the officer's entry because, had the officer left to obtain a warrant, there was a high probability that evidence of the crimes would have been destroyed by the time he returned. Moreover, the officer could reasonably have believed that juveniles might have attempting to drive away while under the influence.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that in the prosecution's case in chief at the penalty phase of the trial of a non-capital felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor, under &sect; 19.2-295.1 it could introduce records showing only the fact of conviction of a criminal offense, including the name of the crime, the date of the conviction, and the court in which the conviction occurred.

After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria (Virginia) overruled the plea in bar. It then held a hearing on the issue of just compensation and awarded the landowners compensation of $53,400. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was taken by the city in order to relocate a storm water box culvert. The court first held that the trial court properly determined that the landowners did not have a right to a jury trial on the issue raised in the plea in bar. In Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25.1-219 and 25.1-220, the legislature had reserved for decision by the trial court those issues that did not involve just compensation or the determination of ownership or other interests in the property sought to be condemned. Next, the trial court correctly held that the condemnation was for a public use under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-1900. The box culvert qualified as a public use because it was designed to function as a component part of the city's sewer system, a use specifically identified in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2109 as one for which a locality might acquire land. Construction of the box culvert would provide the city better access for maintenance and permit the city to place its connecting sewer line primarily underneath public streets. Regardless of any incidental benefit to adjoining property owners, the condemned property would be used exclusively as part of a public utility system built and controlled by the city.</SPAN></P>

Const. art VI, &sect; 10, and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-902, to seek his censure or removal. The judge argued that a formal supervision agreement existed that he did not violate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge relied on the agreement, which allegedly was reached under Virginia JIRC 15(A)(4) (amended 2006). The Commission conditioned his return to the bench on his agreement not to make any statements as to the hearing's outcome until he resumed his duties. He argued that the Commission was relying on statements he made that did not breach the agreement; the Commission denied that a formal supervision agreement existed. On review, the court applied contract law and concluded that there was a valid agreement under Rule 15(A)(4) because the Commission had reduced its terms to writing and the judge had signed the document, thus completing the contract. That no formal order was entered did not matter; the terms provided that he would be allowed to return to the bench if he accepted the terms and began complying with them, which he did. Thus, the court ruled that the Commission had wrongfully failed to follow its own rules and that the judge's statements to two people that &quot;everything would be OK&quot; did not breach the agreement but constituted only pleasantries. He also had a right to say that he would return to the bench, and there was no basis for filing the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a malicious prosecution action against defendants after his stalking conviction in a general district court was reversed on appeal in a circuit court. The Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia) allowed defendants to introduce the conviction into evidence. After a jury verdict in favor of defendants, the trial court dismissed the case with prejudice. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed his criminal conviction under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-132. The court held that when a defendant exercised his rights under &sect; 16.1-132 and a conviction in a general district court was appealed, the fact of that conviction was not admissible in the appeal or in a later civil proceeding. In Ricketts v. J.G. McCrory Co., 138 Va. 548 (1924), it had been held that a conviction by a trial justice, though reversed on appeal, was conclusive evidence of probable case in a malicious prosecution action. Since then, however, based on amendments to the Code of Virginia, the court had held that a de novo appeal annulled the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial and &quot;wiped out&quot; guilty pleas. Accordingly, the conviction here should not have been admitted into evidence. The court rejected defendants' argument that Ricketts should still control because an action for malicious prosecution required an examination of the judicial history of the criminal charges. The case law and statutes establishing the principles of de novo review did not distinguish among the bases for a judgment in general district court from which an appeal was taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment. It remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Those convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal, so petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds, alleging over 30 errors by trial and appellate counsel. The court found that petitioner's errors were either procedurally defaulted because they were, or should have been, raised on direct appeal, or that petitioner failed to satisfy either the &quot;performance&quot; or &quot;prejudice&quot; prong of the two-part Strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel. Since all of petitioner's individual allegati0ns of counsel error were rejected, the court also rejected claims that the cumulative effect of the errors reached constitutional magnitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was originally convicted of capital murder of the victim and the rape and attempted murder of her younger sister. The capital murder conviction was reversed due to an improper indictment. The case was remanded and the Commonwealth amended its murder charge against petitioner after he wrote a letter to the Commonwealth's attorney describing how he attempted to rape the murder victim before killing her. The court rejected petitioner's claim of vindictiveness because the amended indictment for capital murder was obtained after petitioner provided evidence, which had previously been unavailable and which supported the charge. The court rejected petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance because no judicial proceedings had been initiated against him at the time he gave his statements, thus his right to counsel had not attached and his trial counsel had no grounds to raise a Sixth Amendment claim. The court also found that many of the petitioner's claims had been procedurally defaulted because the non-jurisdictional issues could have been raised at trial and on direct appeal and, thus, were not cognizable in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court was asked to consider the constitutionality of the SVPA and the sufficiency of the evidence as to one inmate. The court found that the SVPA survived constitutional scrutiny because (1) there were proper procedures and evidentiary safeguards; (2) the SVPA satisfied the requirement that there be a finding of dangerousness either to one's self or to others; and (3) proof of dangerousness and lack of control was linked to the condition of the person. Further, the SVPA was a non-punitive, civil commitment statute and as such did not violate the guarantees against double jeopardy or ex post facto lawmaking. Furthermore, the use of the clear and convincing evidentiary standard satisfied constitutional requirements of due process. Finally, the evidence was sufficient as to one of the inmate's as the inmate was incarcerated upon a conviction for a sexually violent offense, the inmate was diagnosed with the mental abnormality of pedophilia by experts, and there was clear and convincing evidence that because of his mental abnormality the inmate found it difficult to control his predatory behavior, which made it likely that he would engage in sexually violent acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Prince William County (Virginia), which convicted him of two charges of capital murder and imposed two death sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution arose from the investigation of a series of 16 shootings over a 47-day period while the victims were engaged in everyday pursuits. The court held that the theory of the Commonwealth concerning multiple immediate perpetrators acting as principals in the first degree accurately encompassed Virginia law. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing defendant's motion for a bill of particulars. Aggravating factors were not constitutionally required to be recited in a capital murder indictment. Moreover, any error was rendered harmless by the provision of the information defendant sought in the Commonwealth's notice of intent to seek the death penalty. The terrorism statutes,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-31(13) and 18.2-46.4, were not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. By referencing established criminal offenses as acts of violence subject to the statutory scheme, the legislature included offenses with previously defined elements and mens rea requirements. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding defendant's expert witness testimony concerning mitigation factors at sentencing where defendant knowingly and intelligently refused to cooperate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his two capital murder convictions and two death sentences imposed in the Circuit Court of Prince William County (Virginia), along with convictions for conspiracy to commit capital murder and the illegal use of a firearm in the commission of murder. The case arose from a series of 16 shootings, including 10 murders, that occurred in Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia over a 47-day period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, with his sniper team partner, randomly selected their victims. Defendant advanced 102 assignments of error in his appeal. Among other findings, the supreme court held that defendant was an immediate perpetrator and, as such, was a principal in the first degree in the commission of capital murder during the commission of an act of terrorism. The evidence proved that defendant gave a direction or order sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-18 such that even if he were a criminal actor ordinarily demonstrating culpability as a principal in the second degree, he was nonetheless guilty of capital murder under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-31(13) and 18.2-18. Aggravating factors were not constitutionally required to be recited in a capital murder indictment, and defendant's indictments were sufficient. The Virginia terrorism statutes,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-31(13) and 18.2-46.4, were not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague as claimed by defendant. Defendant's Sixth Amendment rights to consult with standby counsel were not abridged. Finally, the death sentence was proportionate, and the trial was not conducted arbitrarily or prejudicially.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged he was denied effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to object to the verdict form. The inmate asserted that the verdict form was incomplete because it did not include an option requiring a sentence of life imprisonment upon a finding that the Commonwealth had proven neither the &quot;future dangerousness&quot; nor the &quot;vileness&quot; aggravating factor. The supreme court concluded that the representation provided to the inmate by his trial counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness because reasonably competent counsel would have objected to a verdict form that did not comport with judicial precedent and the requirements of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2- 264.4(D)(2). However, the omission in the verdict form did not vitiate all the jury's findings, specifically the findings that the Commonwealth had proven both aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the omission was not a structural error, and the prejudice analysis of Strickland was applicable. Applying that analysis, the supreme court concluded that the inmate failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result would have been different.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that the inmate failed to demonstrate that his defense was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to investigate and present available mitigation evidence introduced at the habeas hearing. The record did not show that, but for his trial counsel's alleged failure, there was a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. Among other things, there was no mitigation evidence presented at the habeas hearing that the inmate had a diminished mental capacity, and there was significant evidence in aggravation, including the brutal nature of the attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party and boyfriend were unmarried adults in a sexually active relationship. The injured party allegedly contracted herpes from the boyfriend. The injured party alleged that the boyfriend knew he had the virus, that he knew the virus was contagious, and that he failed to inform the injured party of the condition. Under Virginia case law, the injured party could not obtain damages if she consented to and participated in an immoral and illegal act. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-344 criminalized sexual intercourse between unmarried adults. As a result, the boyfriend argued that the injured party could not recover for injuries that occurred as a result of the intercourse. The reviewing court held that &sect; 18.2-344 was an unconstitutional infringement upon the right of two adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intercourse and that &sect; 18.2-344 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the injured party's participation in an act that violated &sect; 18.2-344 did not provide a defense to the boyfriend in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to demolish a residence, subdivide the property, and construct two buildings.

Finally, the court held that the BZA improperly granted the owner's request for a variance under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2309(2).

The trial court properly submitted instructions to the jury and did not err by placing the burden of proof on defendant in his pretrial motion to exclude identification testimony at trial or in admitting evidence of the pregnancy of one of the victims because the Commonwealth utilized the evidence for the stated purpose of its introduction. The Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the triggerman in the murders, and because each statutory provision of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(5) required proof of a fact that the other did not, he was properly convicted of two capital offenses in the killing of the same victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, which affirmed the trial court's convictions of defendant for Class 4 felony criminal neglect of her 10-month-old son, resulting in his death, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-371.1(A), and for Class 6 felony criminal neglect of her almost-three-year-old daughter, in violation of &sect; 18.2-371.1(B) (later at Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-371.1(B)(1)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony child neglect and felony murder of her son, but the convictions were reversed on appeal. The Commonwealth, in plea negotiations on new charges of child neglect and involuntary manslaughter, indicated that if defendant did not plead guilty to those charges, it would indict her on felony child neglect of her daughter as well. The plea negotiations failed, and defendant was then indicted as to her daughter. Her motion to quash the indictment with respect to charges involving her daughter was denied, and she was convicted of the two neglect charges. On appeal, the court found that her due process rights were not violated, as a presumption of vindictiveness with respect to the additional charges was not warranted. Defendant failed in her burden to show that there was vindictiveness, and the majority of the cases were actually supportive of the Commonwealth's position. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, as defendant was guilty of &quot;willfulness&quot; and &quot;gross, wanton, and culpable&quot; conduct, in that she was aware of her daughter's jealousy of her sibling, her prior harm, and her prior attempts to kill him.</SPAN></P>

While compelling reasons were presented for each variance application, including the desires of the owners, supported by careful planning to minimize harmful effects to neighboring properties, probable aesthetic improvements to the neighborhood as a whole, together with a probable increase in the local tax base, greatly increased expense to the owners if the plans were reconfigured to meet the requirements of the zoning ordinances, lack of opposition, or even support of the application by neighbors, and serious personal need, by the owners, for the proposed modification, they were immaterial as the BZAs had no authority to act. The threshold question was whether the zoning ordinance interfered with all reasonable beneficial uses of the property, taken as a whole. As the answer was &quot;no,&quot; the BZAs had no authority to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The housing authority owned and operated several housing developments for low-income residents. It decided to deny access to its property to persons who did not have legitimate reasons to visit the housing developments. The city council then enacted an ordinance that closed to public use and travel a particular housing development's streets and sidewalks. The ordinance authorized the police department to notify any person found at that development who did not have a legitimate right to be there that the person was forbidden from being on the property. After a person had been notified, a police officer had a right to arrest that person for trespassing. Defendant was given a hand-delivered letter stating that he was not to be on the property. He was later arrested twice for trespassing. The third time he was arrested for trespassing, he alleged that the housing authority's trespass policy was unconstitutional. Eventually, the state supreme court reviewed his argument and found that the policy did not violate his Fourteenth Amendment right to intimate association as that right did not permit him to commit intentional acts of criminal trespass on the housing authority's property.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond did not have the power to issue an injunction staying the execution. Additionally, the inmate could not use a declaratory judgment action as a substitute for appeal or habeas corpus. He should have raised these issues before the trial court and on appeal from his conviction. Additionally, the inmate waived any right he may have had to challenge lethal injection because he had a choice among lethal injection, electrocution, or the default of lethal injection provided by statute upon his refusal to specify.

The prisoner specifically disclaimed any federal constitutional claims. Execution of prisoners by electrocution did not violate Va. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9 or 11. Under Virginia law, the prisoner could not use a declaratory judgment action to decide an issue he had waived by allowing the statutory default provisions to apply. The effect of the waiver removed the prisoner's claims from those that could be properly considered by declaratory judgment. The issue presented by the prisoner in his declaratory judgment action should have been raised before the trial court in his criminal case and on direct appeal from that judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of the United States, the court considered the proper construction of the prima facie evidence provision of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-423 and the severability of the provision from the core provisions of the statute. Additionally, the court considered whether defendants' cross-burning convictions should be vacated and dismissed, vacated with the opportunity for the Commonwealth to retry defendants, or affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined the Commonwealth's invitation to interpret a model jury instruction, given in another case, to save the prima facie evidence provision of &sect; 18.2-423 from unconstitutionality. The instruction, taken in context of the other instructions, properly interpreted the provision. Thus, the court affirmed its prior holding that the prima facie evidence provision of &sect; 18.2-423 was unconstitutionally overbroad because of its chilling effect upon the exercise of free speech under the First Amendment. The court rejected defendants' contention that &sect; 18.2-423 could not be severed from the remainder of the statute because &sect; 18.2-423 did not fall within either of the exceptions to the rule of severability established in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 1-17.1. The Commonwealth did not waive the issue of severability by failing to raise it prior to the appeal to the Supreme Court. Because Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 was coextensive with the First Amendment's free speech provisions, after severance of the provision concerning prima facie evidence of intent, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-423 did not violate the First Amendment or Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. Retrial was not necessary in defendants' cases.</SPAN></P>

She involved her 16-year-old daughter in the plan to kill the victims. Defendant also paid for the shotguns and ammunition used to kill her husband and stepson. The two murderers that defendant hired to kill the two men then came to the husband's house and shot the husband and the stepson as they lay asleep in their home; however, defendant waited at least 45 minutes before she reported the shootings. Defendant pled guilty to two counts of capital murder for hire and related crimes and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the state supreme court found the evidence was sufficient to warrant the sentence, as it showed defendant's depraved state of mind and the finding of vileness required to impose the death penalty, and the sentence was not disproportionate or excessive when compared with other, similar crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of capital murder and rape. Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder and life in prison for rape. The verdict was affirmed on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the resentencing proceeding violated his right of due process by improperly shifting the burden of proof and that the jury at the resentencing proceeding was not able to &quot;gain the same feel&quot; for the case due to his inability to challenge the Commonwealth's evidence. Thus, defendant argued that the jury at the resentencing proceeding was more biased in favor of imposing the death penalty, and the trial court should have imposed a life sentence. The supreme court held that the resentencing did not violate defendant's due process rights, nor was it biased, as all the evidence presented was relevant to the issues of future dangerousness and vileness. Defendant also argued that because he presented extensive evidence of mental illness, he was entitled to have the case remanded on that issue. The supreme court held that said claim was frivolous, as defendant's expert testified that he was not mentally retarded. Next, the supreme court held that imposition of the death penalty was permitted despite the fact that defendant was 16 at the time of the murder. Finally, the supreme court held that the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held, inter alia, that: (1) defendant's complaints regarding the constitutionality of Va.

The Commissioner adopted the hearing officer's findings and recommendations, and his decision was affirmed by the circuit court and the intermediate court of appeals. The state supreme court held that (1) the Commissioner's decision was flawed because it was based on an analysis of the methodology which the distributor used to distribute cars, not on a determination that the dealer did not receive the number of cars he was entitled to receive under his franchise agreement in relation to the number of cars imported nationally; and (2) because the Commissioner misinterpreted the statute and his decision would be reversed on that basis, it was not necessary to consider the distributor's claim that &sect; 46.2-1569(7) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 78 was not an unconstitutional violation of Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14 because it was authorized by Va. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. 2002 Va. Acts ch. 78 did not violate the uniformity requirement of Va. Const. art.

The prohibition against ex post facto laws in Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 applied only to criminal proceedings. The General Assembly had the power to enact 2002 Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant customers sued defendant county board of supervisors, and others, seeking a declaration that a solid waste disposal fee imposed under Wise County, Va., Ordinance No. 3-1993 (amended 2001) was unconstitutional and void. The county board of supervisors moved to dismiss. The Circuit Court of Wise County (Virginia) found the statute was valid and constitutional and granted the motion to dismiss. The customers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wise County, Va., Ordinance No. 3-1993 (amended 2001) had a schedule for waste disposal fees based on classifications which included households and types of businesses. The customers argued that those classifications were not based on real differences, and violated equal protection. The appellate court found that the only basis stated for the yearly flat fee for the classification of &quot;households&quot; was to leave the rate for that classification the same as it was when the ordinance was adopted. That rationale had no relation to the governmental objective of establishing a fair and equitable fee schedule based on the size of containers and the number of &quot;pick-ups&quot; per week, and that reflected the costs of waste disposal. There was no evidence showing the reasonableness of the business classifications and the relationship of those classifications to the stated governmental objective, nor any evidence explaining the basis for classifying certain businesses like households when the classifications were supposedly based on container size and number of &quot;pick-ups.&quot; The classifications were not based on distinctions that rendered one class distinct or different from another class.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found no error in the trial court's refusal to appoint an investigator for defendant, as he failed show a particularized need for an investigator's services. As a prospective juror never indicated in his voir dire responses that he could reach a decision about whether to impose the death penalty or a term of life imprisonment, the trial court correctly excused him for cause. A target, empty cartridge casings, and bullets found in a tree at defendant's home were properly admitted: the bullets in the tree and those recovered from the victim's body were fired from one weapon, and evidence of the target and cartridge casings suggested that defendant knew how to shoot that particular firearm and was thus pertinent to the issue of whether the pistol just &quot;went off.&quot; Evidence that defendant killed the victim in front of her husband with multiple gunshots and left them both to die, merely to rob them, supported both the &quot;future dangerousness&quot; and &quot;vileness&quot; statutory aggravators.

The proceeds of the association's public sale under &sect; 55-79.84(I) had to be applied first to satisfy the bank's prior lien before the association could apply the proceeds of that sale in satisfaction of its own lien as well as other encumbrances on the property pursuant to &sect; 55-79.84(I)(5)(c).</SPAN></P>

The entire action stemmed from allegations of fraud in conjunction with the sale of some property. However, the allegation did not address procurement of the arbitration award and, thus, could not have acted as a basis for vacation. Second, the broker failed to prove that the arbitrators were not impartial, refused to hear material evidence, and refused to allow certain cross-examination. Third, the cases relied upon to support a claim that the arbitration panel disregarded provisions of the underlying contract were either decided prior to the enactment of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.010 or involved questions not presented herein. Fourth, &sect; 8.01-581.010 provided the exclusive means for setting aside an arbitration award. Thus, the trial court correctly struck count VI of the broker's amended bill of complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon certiorari, the Supreme Court identified two reasons consistent to justify a categorical exclusion of the mentally retarded from execution. However, neither of the two justifications for recognizing the death penalty, retribution and deterrence, applied to mentally retarded offenders. The diminished capacity of mentally retarded offenders placed them at greater risk of wrongful execution. Left undone was a determination whether defendant was mentally retarded, thus requiring the instant court to commute his sentence of death to life imprisonment. Thus, the instant court held that the case had to be remanded to the Circuit Court of York County for a hearing on the sole issue of whether defendant was mentally retarded as defined in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.3:1.1(A). The circuit court was thus ordered to empanel a new jury for the sole purpose of making a determination of mental retardation.</SPAN></P>

Counsel's failure to object to requiring the inmate to wear a stun belt at trial did not prejudice the inmate, as nothing showed the jury saw the belt.

With regard to the penalty phase, the evidence was ample to support the jury's finding of a future dangerousness factor in aggravation (even though defendant did not have an extensive criminal record), the trial court had properly declined to elaborate on the definition of life imprisonment it had provided to the jury before it commenced penalty deliberations, and the death sentence was neither imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors nor was it excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

If the legislature's reconciliation of various criteria was fairly debatable and not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or wholly unwarranted, its redistricting plan did not violate the compactness and contiguity provisions of Va. Const. art. II, &sect; 6. The evidence did not show districts at issue violated these provisions. The standards for reviewing federal equal protection claims applied to review of claims of racial gerrymandering, contrary to Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Race was a factor in composing districts, under the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1971 through 1974(e), but it was not predominant, eliminating the strict scrutiny standard, and qualifying alternative plans were not shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorcycle manufacturer filed suit against defendants, the commissioner of the department of motor vehicles and a motorcycle dealership, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The manufacturer alleged that the commissioner's interpretation of the second paragraph of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1993.67(5) was unconstitutional. The federal district court certified four questions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer contended that the commissioner's interpretation and enforcement of the second paragraph of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1993.67(5) violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the so-called &quot;dormant&quot; Commerce Clause. It required the manufacturer to give notice, at least 45 days prior to the establishment of a new or additional franchise, and to prove inadequate representation of the line-make of the motorcycle, in the area for which it was attempting to establish another franchise. The instant court agreed with the commissioner that the second paragraph did not require proof of inadequate representation on a statewide basis. However, the court did not agree that proof of inadequate representation should be limited to the same county, city, or town in which the proposed new dealer would be located. The intent of the legislature was to provide motorcycle dealers an opportunity to protest, not limited by arbitrary mileage restrictions. Those protesting dealers who made a preliminary showing that they were actually representing, in a not insubstantial way, the line-make of motorcycles in the area at issue, would qualify to have a determination made by the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One certified question was restated and answered in the affirmative. Two others were answered in the negative, and one was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

Only part of the RRHA's trespass policy was written, and the RRHA allowed its housing manager to determine who had a legitimate business or social purpose for being on RRHA property. Defendant, a nonresident who was not employed by the RRHA, was issued a letter barring him from RRHA property after he was found on it, and he was charged with trespass after he returned to the property in violation of that letter. The state supreme court held that (1) defendant could challenge the constitutionality of the RRHA procedures in defending the criminal charges filed against him; and (2) the RRHA's trespass policy was invalid because it was overly broad and infringed upon First Amendment protections.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held two continuances were correctly attributed to him. He was not entitled to suppression of a statement made before his consulate was notified under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, art. 36, 21 U.S.T. 77. He had no standing to object to the search of a vehicle he was not authorized to have. The trial court correctly denied his challenges for cause. He showed no systematic exclusion of African-Americans from the jury. Evidence of a prior arrest by the victim was relevant to intent and motive. He was not entitled to a prison conditions expert. As he could choose between electrocution and lethal injection, and electrocution was constitutional, it was unnecessary to decide if lethal injection was constitutional. After instructing the jury life imprisonment meant life without parole, the trial court properly referred the jury to its instructions when answering a question as to ways defendant could be released. An instruction that defendant could be released by executive pardon would have caused improper speculation. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over four years after his injury, and after he reached his majority, plaintiff 19-year old filed a medical malpractice action against defendants, doctors and their employers. The Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke, Virginia, dismissed on grounds that the claim was time-barred. The 19-year old appealed, claiming the statute that reduced the tolling period provided for infants' medical malpractice claims was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected the claim that the medical malpractice statute of limitations, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-229(A)(2)(a), for minors effectively denied the 19-year old the right of a jury trial. The legislature could extinguish a cause of action by the imposition of a statute of limitations without affecting a fundamental, constitutional right. From a due process standpoint, the challenged legislation: (1) did give prospective litigants reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard; (2) did not lack a reasonable relation to the proper public purposes of relieving the insurance availability crisis and eliminating stale medical malpractice claims of infants; and (3) was not arbitrary or discriminatory in differentiating between infants with medical malpractice claims and infants with other tort claims. The medical malpractice statute of limitations for minors did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Virginia. The statute passed muster under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Constitution of Virginia. The statute was special legislation under Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

The employer's complaint to the bureau of insurance and the Virginia Beach Police Department was prompted by the discovery of a power of attorney form in the employee's former desk, a matter unrelated to the use of his name. As such, it was not relevant to support an award of compensatory damages. The evidence concerning the investigation of this complaint was irrelevant to the award of punitive damages for the &quot;knowing&quot; use of the employee's name. The evidence admitted in support of the award of punitive damages was irrelevant to the underlying statutory cause of action. The trial court erred in denying the employer's motion in limine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff zoning administrator issued a notice of violation to defendant monk for use of his property as a place of worship without a special use permit. The Virginia Board of Zoning Appeals affirmed. The administrator filed an action against the monk in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia) for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to enforce the zoning ordinance. The trial court found for the administrator. The monk appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The monk argued that the ordinance violated the Free Exercise Clause. The supreme court disagreed and concluded that the zoning ordinance that required a special use permit to use property as a place of worship imposed a minimal and incidental burden on the right of free exercise of religion. The ordinance did not totally prohibit operation of a church in the district and any cost associated with the permit process or relocation of the church did not impact any religious belief and thus was not of constitutional dimension. The monk argued that the ordinance was not neutral or generally applicable because it targeted religious conduct occurring at his home and because it relied on individualized determinations of the types of gatherings at persons' homes. The supreme court rejected these arguments because the fact that use of land for churches or other places of worship was not permitted as a matter of right did not mean that the ordinance was not neutral. There was no evidence that the object of the ordinance was to infringe upon or restrict certain practices because of their religious motivation and there was nothing in the ordinance &quot;targeting&quot; religious conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding that the ordinance as it applied to churches and other such places of worship was a neutral law of general applicability, which had a minimal or incidental burden on religious practice or conduct. The supreme court, vacated the injunction contained in the final decree and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of an injunction consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The Virginia Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that &sect; 18.2-423 violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The supreme court agreed. Symbolic expression was protected under the First Amendment and, with the exception of obscenity, defamation, and &quot;fighting words,&quot; could not be regulated based on content. It was impermissible to punish intimidation or threats based only upon racial or religious grounds, or some other content-focused category of otherwise protected speech. The absence in &sect; 18.2-423 of an explicit content-based prohibition did not mask the motivating purpose behind the statute, given the historical context of cross burning and fact that the statute provided that burning a cross was prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate. Section 18.2-423 was aimed at content, not the secondary effects of protected speech. The statute was overbroad in that it allowed arrest and prosecution for otherwise protected speech based on a statutory inference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association contended that the trial court erred in finding that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2297 did not apply to the county. The zoning administrator challenged the trial court's conclusion that a zoning proffer that provided recreational facilities by requiring payment of membership dues in a private recreational association was unconstitutional. The county accepted proffers pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2303, which did not include the limitation at issue. The county never adopted any of the provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2297. Unlike Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2297(A), Va. Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 15.2-2303(A) did not contain a prohibition against payment for off-site improvements. Neither did former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-491(a). Fairfax County, Va., Zoning Ordinance art. 1, pt. 2, &sect; 1-200(15) was not any affirmative adoption of any provision of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-2297(A)(v). The proffer did not violate the constitutional proscription against special legislation, as its objective was to provide recreational facilities to the residents of the condominium, which was a legitimate and reasonable legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was sentenced to death after the jury found &quot;future dangerousness.&quot; Appellant challenged the judgment and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant and an accomplice robbed a bank. One month later, appellant entered the same bank alone. A security guard came and stood at the end of the &quot;teller line&quot; in which customers were waiting. Appellant stood in line behind several customers. He left the line and walked toward the security guard. He then fired a gunshot into the security guard, killing him. Appellant quickly announced a robbery and stated he would kill everyone if he didn't get some money. He was given money and then left. He was arrested a few days later. Appellant was charged with a capital offense for the killing committed during the robbery and several noncapital offenses related to the robbery. After the jury found him guilty and found &quot;future dangerousness&quot; as an aggravating factor warranting the death penalty, the appellate court found that appellant waived or defaulted on several issues. It also found the jury was properly selected, the evidence was sufficient to show premeditation to support the capital murder charge, that statements appellant made to a hostage negotiator were not statements against interest, that the jury was properly instructed, and appellant was properly sentenced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court permitted amendment of defendant's indictment for capital murder to also charge capital murder &quot;during the commission of or subsequent to rape and/or attempted rape and/or sodomy and/or attempted sodomy.&quot; Defendant was convicted, also of related crimes, and sentenced to death based upon the vileness aggravating factor only. The Virginia Supreme Court heard a consolidated appeal and granted a petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence showed that defendant went to his female acquaintance's house armed with knives and a gun; that they argued; and that he beat and stabbed her. Later the girl's younger sister came and found the body. Defendant raped her, strangled her to unconsciousness, stabbed her, slit her throat and wrists, then searched the house for things to take. The younger sister survived and identified defendant. He was convicted. The Virginia Supreme Court held that the particular amendment made to the indictment was not authorized by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-231. As the original capital murder indictment's gradation crime was robbery, and the amended one's were rape or sodomy, it was not a simple correction, but rather an indictment expanded to a new capital charge under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(4), (5). The jury poll established that defendant was acquitted of robbery capital murder. There was no evidence that defendant sexually assaulted the decedent before or during her murder, or that her sister's rape did not occur after the murder. Certain veniremembers were properly stricken. The Commonwealth improperly referred to defendant's trial silence. The verdict form was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for capital murder was reversed; convictions for abduction, rape, attempted capital murder, and grand larceny were affirmed; and the case remanded for a new trial on a charge of no greater than first degree murder, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Augusta County (Virginia) convicted defendant of capital murder. The jury found that defendant represented a continuing serious threat to society and that his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or aggravated battery to the victim. Defendant was sentenced to death, and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and other inmates had a private meeting in a prison room. A guard noticed commotion among them and saw defendant and another stabbing the victim. Other responding guards saw defendant stabbing the victim many times under his arm and in his waist. An autopsy revealed 68 stab wounds, 40 in the chest, many fatal. Defendant admitted that he did not like the victim, had planned to kill him, and did so based on defendant's religion. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. The Supreme Court affirmed. Defendant was not permitted to withdraw questions that he asked of the venire and subsequently make an objection based upon those questions that he voluntarily withdrew. The trial court's denial of appointment of an expert at Commonwealth expense on the subject of &quot;prison life&quot; was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant suffered no prejudice.  Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.4(B) did not require admission of evidence of the victim's criminal history, even in this capital case. It was not relevant. In death sentence proportionality review, the fact defendant was an inmate was only one of several other factors the Court considered. The Court did not find the sentence excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Prince William County (Virginia) convicted defendant of capital murder, gradation crime of rape, unanimous jury; attempted capital murder; rape; and abduction. It sentenced defendant, by unanimous jury, to death for the capital murder, based only on a vileness aggravating factor, and to three life in prison terms and two $ 100,000 fines for the other crimes. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a girl; bound, raped, strangled, and severely stabbed another; and looked in their house for things to take. Defendant was indicted for, among other things, rape and one capital murder count in which the gradation crime was robbery. The Commonwealth amended the indictment by using the term &quot;and/or&quot; to charge two new gradation crimes, rape and sodomy, or their attempts. Defendant was convicted. The supreme court affirmed defendant's non-capital convictions, reversed the capital murder conviction, determined that he could not be retried for it, and remanded for a new trial on no greater a charge than first degree murder should the Commonwealth desire.  Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-231 did not authorize the Commonwealth's indictment amendment. The amendment did not simply correct a variance between the original allegation and the proof expected to be adduced at trial. Rather, by use of &quot;and/or,&quot; the Commonwealth expanded the indictment to include a new additional capital murder charge. Thus defendant potentially could have been convicted of two capital murder counts. The court also instructed on capital jury verdict forms and found a failure-to-testify comment violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for conspiracy to murder and attempted possession of an unregistered firearm muffler or silencer were affirmed by the Virginia Court of Appeals. He appealed to the Supreme Court, alleging the Court of Appeals erred holding the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions; the firearm muffler statute was unconstitutional; and that the court erred in affirming the trial court's refusal to give instructions defining certain terms in the firearm silencer statute. The court affirmed the orders of the appeals court, reasoning sufficient evidence was presented that defendant entered into a plan to have the victim killed, that no overt act in furtherance of the underlying crime was necessary, that he agreed to make a silencer to accomplish the job, that he had every intent in making an operational silencer, even though he possessed the imperfect device, that firearm silencer statute was not ambiguous and defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction defining its terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Arlington County (Virginia) that defendant was entitled to an exemption from the business license tax pursuant to Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant produced radio programs. The broadcast signal for the programs was processed at defendant's studios and routed, monitored, and adjusted for further transmission. The signal was received by radio stations through contractual arrangements, and by non-affiliate stations such as college radio stations. The radio signal was not encoded or encrypted and there was no fee for receiving the signal. Plaintiff county assessed business license taxes against defendant. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3703(C)(3) provided an exemption from taxation for broadcasters. Defendant's activities were &quot;broadcasting&quot; because even though defendant did not possess a Federal Communications Commission broadcasting license. In determining whether defendant was operating a broadcasting service, the court examined its activities up to the point at which it released control of the transmission. Ownership of the equipment used in the transmission was not determinative of the scope of defendant's activities. The record supported the conclusion that defendant retained control of the transmission or dissemination of its radio signal through the point at which the signal was transmitted by the satellite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The record supported the trial court's finding that defendant created, transmitted, and disseminated radio signals to the public and, therefore, was engaged in broadcasting, and exempt from the business license tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Arlington County (Virginia) which convicted him for capital murder during the commission of a robbery, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-31(4), 18.2-58. The court consolidated the automatic review of appellant's death sentence with his appeal of the capital murder conviction and certified the appeal for robbery. It also certified the appeal of the robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant went to the pool hall where he formerly worked, fatally stabbed an employee, grabbed the cash drawer and left. Appellant was found guilty by a jury of capital murder based on the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of the employee during the commission of a robbery, for robbery. In the penalty phase of the trial, the jury fixed his punishment for capital murder at death based on a finding of &quot;future dangerousness,&quot; and for robbery at life imprisonment, which the trial court imposed. The highest court consolidated the automatic review of the death penalty with the appeals of his convictions. The convictions and sentencing were upheld. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike a juror for cause, as she stated she could be fair. Nor was there abuse in admitting evidence of appellant's flight after commission of the crime as it was probative. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict. Further, the evidence of the offenses and of appellant's prior criminal behavior, was sufficient to support the jury's finding of &quot;future dangerousness,&quot; for the death penalty, and was not disproportionate to the crime, nor excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because there was no reversible error in the judgments of the trial court. Further, after review of appellant's sentence, the court declined to commute the sentence of death as the sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to penalties imposed by other sentencing bodies in the Commonwealth for comparable crimes, considering both the crime and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

It ordered a public reprimand and the appellant sought review. He argued that DR 6-101(C) was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient. The court affirmed. It found that the rule was presumed to be constitutional and that because a U.S. Const. amend. I issue was not involved, vagueness challenges were examined in light of the case facts. Using that that standard, the court found that when it considered the appellant's conduct, the rule was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant filed an appeal from a decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton (Virginia), in which appellant was convicted of murdering his wife and son and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of murdering his wife and son, appealed, arguing trial court error. The court affirmed. Photographs of the crime scene and the victims' autopsies were not cumulative or irrelevant. They established the method, maliciousness, and degree of atrociousness of the murders, therefore they were properly admitted. Because appellant voluntarily accompanied police to the station to continue the ruse that his wife had received threatening calls and notes and was made aware that he was free to leave if he desired, there was no merit to his contention that any statements he made prior to being given Miranda warnings violated his constitutional rights. Because the evidence showed that appellant acquired the murder weapon several weeks before the killings and made elaborate efforts over several months to deflect future suspicion from himself, there was no doubt that his wife's murder was deliberate and premeditated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Crime scene and autopsy photographs established the method, maliciousness, and vileness of the murders, thus they were properly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, 16 when he committed the crime, was convicted as an adult of capital murder in the commission of rape, and appealed. The court affirmed. Because appellant had previously been tried and convicted as an adult for another rape, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-271 required that appellant be considered and treated as an adult in any future criminal proceedings. The court held that procuring a blood sample for DNA analysis from a convicted felon neither violated the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures, nor the right against self-incrimination because taking a blood sample was not testimonial or communicative in nature. Evidence of appellant's two prior rape convictions was properly admitted because it was based on common incidents sufficiently idiosyncratic to establish the probability of a common perpetrator. Finally, appellant's death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to penalties imposed for comparable crimes, considering both the crime and appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's trial and conviction as an adult was proper because he had been previously convicted as an adult for another rape.

Appellant Commonwealth moved to quash the transportation orders in the general district court, and the court denied the motion. On appeal to the trial court, appellant's motion to quash was dismissed. The Supreme Court agreed with appellant's claim that the trial court erred in failing to hold that the authority to issue prisoner transportation orders in civil cases granted by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-410 was vested solely in the circuit courts. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-69.27 did not authorize general district courts to order the transportation of prisoners to appear in civil cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a former trustee of the commonwealth's retirement system, challenged the dismissal of his claims for indemnification against appellee commonwealth for legal fees that he incurred defending against criminal investigations, resulting in no charges, that arose from the performance of his official duties. The court affirmed, finding that Va. Code &sect; 2.1-526.8 created no statutory right of reimbursement and any person seeking reimbursement must do so in accordance with any insurance plan that was established under the statute. Creating a common-law right that would entitle a public official to obtain reimbursement from appellee for legal expenses was in the province of the legislature, not the judiciary. 1997 Va. Acts ch. 821, cl. 2, that only allowed reimbursement of expenses incurred within a certain time period, did not violate the prohibition of the commonwealth's constitution against special laws and withstood a rational basis test to withstand an equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because the statute did not create a right of indemnification for legal fees, and the court refused to create a common-law right for a public official to obtain reimbursement from the commonwealth, and the statute classifying which fees were reimbursable did not violate the special laws prohibition and withstood the equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Virginia, challenged the rejection of its sovereign immunity plea in bar and judgment for complainants awarding back overtime wages and attorney fees in complainant's Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S &sect; 201, et seq., claim. The court reversed, entering judgment for appellant. Because the legislature had not abrogated appellant's sovereign immunity for FLSA actions by its employees, the court lacked jurisdictional authority over complainants' action and any alleged procedural waiver of immunity was inapplicable. Complainants' argument that their claim was actually a pecuniary claim for which sovereign immunity had been abrogated failed because complainants' suit was not styled as a contract claim or brought in the prescribed manner. Complainants' argument that their FLSA claim constituted a property right of which they had been deprived also failed because such an entitlement could not accrue independent of their ability to maintain an action for those damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was reversed and judgment was entered for appellant. Appellant had not waived by legislative action its sovereign immunity from Fair Labor Standards Act suits by its employees and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear complainants' claims. Appellant could not procedurally waive such immunity.</SPAN></P>

The officer's asking defendant what was in a cellophane bag did not convert the lawful detention into an unlawful seizure; [2]-Once defendant showed the officer the leafy green contents of the bag, the officer had independent probable cause to arrest defendant for possession of marijuana and was permitted to search the vehicle incident to the arrest.

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-104, and the choice of the word conviction rather than offense demonstrates the intent to authorize punishment enhancement where the defendant has been convicted of the prior charge; [2]-It was uncontroverted that at the time of her conviction of the present offense, defendant had twice been convicted of larceny, and thus the trial court did not err in finding the enhanced penalty provision in &sect; 18.2-104 was applicable; [3]-The meaning of &sect; 18.2-104 is clear on its face, and the statute does not require interpretation of ambiguity; [4]-A person of ordinary intelligence would understand that any second or subsequent conviction of a larceny offense would make him or her eligible for the enhanced punishment provision, and there was no error in the trial court's ruling that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 20-109(A), the wife could not cohabit with another woman was supported by prior determinations of Virginia courts; [3]-The parties agreed, in the property settlement agreement (PSA), that &sect; 20-109 would govern any proceeding where the husband alleged cohabitation as a basis to terminate spousal support; [4]-Since the PSA awarded costs incurred by a party in the successful defense to any enforcement action, and the wife prevailed, the trial court did not err in awarding her attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

XIV, &sect; 1 were violated. HOLDINGS: [1]-The circuit court erred as a matter of law in reversing the hearing officer's decision because the employee was afforded a constitutionally acceptable opportunity to respond to the pre-termination notice of disciplinary action which was issued to him. Moreover, the adequacy of the hearing officer's evidentiary hearing and his decision on the merits of the termination decision cured any alleged deficiency in the employee's pre-deprivation process, particularly his claim that he did not have an opportunity to respond to a memo he received many weeks prior to the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton (Virginia), which affirmed an order of appellee Virginia Board of Nursing denying her petition to be a Certified Nurse Aide. She argued that the 18 Va. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 90-25-80 and 90-25-81 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the due processes clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1; Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that there was no Equal Protection Clause violation. The applicant was accorded the same process as other nurse aides who allowed their certifications to lapse. In accordance with 18 Va. Admin. Code &sect; 90-25-80, the applicant was not eligible for certification by reinstatement. The applicant had multiple findings of neglect and a finding of misappropriation of patient property on her record. The applicant was afforded due process. She was given reasonable notice of the hearing regarding the charges of neglect and misappropriation of patient property. The applicant was given a meaningful opportunity to be heard in the hearing. Section 90-25-80 did not create an irrebuttable presumption that violated the applicant's due process rights. The applicant had multiple findings of neglect and a finding of misappropriation of patient property on her record. The Board was well within its statutory authority to deny the applicant certification by endorsement application. The findings of neglect and finding of misappropriation of patient property constituted a violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54.1-3007 and 54.1-3024(3) and 18 Va. Admin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A treating psychiatrist petitioned for court-ordered treatment of a patient. The general district court granted the petition. The patient appealed. The Circuit Court of the City of Danville (Virginia) denied the patient's request for a jury, conducted an evidentiary hearing, and granted the petition for court-ordered treatment. The patient appealed. The circuit court's order expired. The Commonwealth of Virginia moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court entered an order, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 37.2-1101, which required a patient at a state psychiatric facility to undergo psychiatric and medical treatment against his will. The patient, who was declared legally insane years earlier, claimed that the circuit court should have impanelled a jury to decide the patient's case and, in any event, should not have authorized a course of treatment that violated the patient's basic beliefs. On appeal, the court found that, although the case was moot, because the treatment order had expired under its own terms, the jury trial issue presented an exceptional situation that was capable of repetition, yet evading review. However, it was imprudent for the court to address the sufficiency of the evidence issue under the capable-of-repetition, yet-evading-review doctrine. In addition, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and the plea-in-equity procedure recognized by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-336(D) did not require the circuit court to impanel a jury to decide whether the patient's case under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 37.2-1101(G)(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Roanoke County, Virginia convicted defendant of aggravated malicious wounding under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-51.2 and second-degree murder under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-32. The trial court imposed the jury's recommended sentences on each conviction. On appeal, defendant contended that his conviction of and sentencing for both crimes in a single trial violated the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two offenses required elements of proof that the other did not. The aggravated malicious wounding statute, Va. Code Ann. Code &sect; 18.2-51.2, prohibited certain methods of violence resulting in severe and permanent injury. The murder statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-32, punished the taking of life without regard to the method. Aggravated malicious wounding required proof of a specific intent, whereas second-degree murder required no specific intent. With different elements of proof, aggravated malicious wounding was not a lesser-included offense of second-degree murder. Malicious wounding was not a lesser-included offense of attempted murder and the legislature intended multiple punishments. Where there were distinct elements of proof, the facts of the particular case had no bearing on the abstract analysis of the statutes. The offenses, having separate and distinct elements, allowed for prosecution under both statutes. Thus, the court found that the legislature authorized separate punishments for those acts. Accordingly, defendant's convictions for both aggravated malicious wounding and second-degree murder did not violate the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which convicted him of possession of cocaine in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-250. He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence a police officer obtained from his person after conducting a traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer pulled defendant over for driving with a cracked windshield. A record check indicated that defendant had a narcotics arrest and was on probation. Defendant gave the officer permission to search him for weapons. The officer noticed that defendant's boots were loosely laced. He asked defendant if he would voluntarily take his boots off, and defendant did. The officer found crack cocaine in the boots. Defendant argued that the officer exceeded the scope of the traffic investigation and did not obtain valid consent to search. The court of appeals held that defendant was not illegally detained, and the search was consensual. The traffic investigation ended once the officer returned defendant's license and issued a warning. The officer then immediately asked for permission to search, and defendant complied without hesitation or qualification. When the officer sought permission to search defendant's vehicle the encounter was consensual, and defendant was not seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.

The trial court erred in determining that the earlier prosecution, discontinued on a finding of good cause for a nolle prosequi, should have been terminated under &sect; 19.2-243, even though defendant never moved to dismiss the earlier proceeding on speedy trial grounds. A nolle prosequi terminated the prosecution and left the situation the same as if the no charge had been filed. If a future grand jury re-indicted the defendant, the speedy trial clock began anew. After the nolle prosequi order became final, the trial court had no power to conclude that the prior case should have been dismissed under &sect; 19.2-243, rather than discontinued pursuant to the Commonwealth's nolle prosequi motion. By reconsidering its decision in the first proceeding and not running the speedy trial deadline anew in the second proceeding, the trial court erred in concluding that &sect; 19.2-243 barred defendant's prosecution under the second set of indictments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant maternal grandmother appealed an order by the Circuit Court of Prince William County (Virginia) that transferred legal and physical custody of her grandchild from her to the county department of social services (D.S.S.); the grandmother claimed that the order was not a final dispositional order because the juvenile and domestic relations district court ordered the matter to return to court for an interim review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the grandmother had been observed passing fraudulent prescriptions in the presence of the child and was being charged in federal court with prescription fraud, legal and physical custody of the child was transferred from the grandmother to D.S.S. The grandmother did not file a notice of appeal from that order. Thereafter, the order was amended to transfer physical custody of the child to the mother. The grandmother appeal that order. The appellate court found, inter alia, that order at issue was captioned &quot;dispositional order,&quot; transferred custody of the child to the D.S.S., made the finding required by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-278.2(A)(5)(c), established specific terms for visitation, authorized placement with the mother, and was entered after an adjudicatory order. Therefore, it was a final order under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.1-278.2(D) and 16.1-296(A). The fact that the juvenile and domestic relations district court ordered the matter to return for an &quot;interim review&quot; did not alter the nature of the order as a dispositional order. Therefore, the grandmother's failure to appeal the dispositional order precluded the exercise of jurisdiction by the circuit court over it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Franklin County (Virginia), which convicted him of grand larceny. He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained using a global positioning system device (GPS) placed on his car because the placement and use of the GPS without a warrant or exigent circumstances violated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-146 and the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because the officers did not obtain a warrant before attaching the GPS to his vehicle and admitted that information from the GPS was instrumental in their decision to obtain search warrants and stop and search his vehicle, all fruits of that stop and search, including his statements, were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the challenged evidence. Evidence obtained from independent sources provided probable cause for defendant's arrest and the accompanying search of his vehicle for a crime committed only hours earlier. Placement of the GPS on defendant's car constituted a warrantless search. The officers obtained from an independent source evidence sufficient to provide probable cause to arrest defendant and search his vehicle. Their focus on defendant as a suspect did not begin with the placement of the GPS device on his vehicle. It began when a county deputy told a lieutenant that he had stopped a suspicious vehicle in a store parking lot long after the store had closed. The police were also investigating the attempted break-in of another market.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer activated his signal and pursued the car defendant was driving; it turned into a gas station, accelerated, and re-entered the road without stopping or slowing down, causing other vehicles to brake or stop.

He argued the prosecution failed to prove that he endangered a person or the operation of a law enforcement vehicle, as required to convict him of violating &sect; 46.2-817(B). The appellate court disagreed. He endangered the officer, himself, and nearby motorists; that no one was harmed was immaterial. His conviction of reckless driving arising from the same incident did not bar his prosecution for felony eluding under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-294; as arrest warrants for the two offenses were issued on the same date, they were brought in a &quot;single proceeding, &quot; even though, for jurisdictional reasons, they were resolved by two different courts. As reckless driving and felony eluding were separate offenses in that different facts were required to prove each, defendant's conviction of both offenses did not violate the double jeopardy bar. Moreover, &sect; 46.2-817(E) authorized a separate punishment for felony eluding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee repair service provider challenged a chargeback imposed on it by appellant manufacturer by asking appellee Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles to declare both the chargeback and a rate change unlawful under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1571. The Circuit Court of Fauquier County (Virginia) upheld the Commissioner's finding that the chargeback and the rate change were invalid. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider sold and serviced trucks for the manufacturer pursuant to a franchise agreement, which spelled out what the provider could charge the manufacturer when it performed warranty work for it. At the time the dispute arose, the hourly rate for warranty work approved by the manufacturer was $102 per hour. After the provider sought an hourly rate increase, a secret shopper made a call to the provider and was quoted a labor rate of $90. Based on this discrepancy, the manufacturer concluded that the provider was charging it $102 for warranty work while charging its retail customers $90 per hour. Thus, it imposed the chargeback on the provider. First, &sect; 46.2-1571 required a comparison of amounts, not rates. Second, the Commissioner's ruling, adopted by the circuit court, omitted some of the key steps required by &sect; 46.2-1571 where the testimony offered by the provider was limited to one month rather than the full twelve months of the chargeback. Furthermore, it was not clear whether warranty work performed for another manufacturer was included in the calculation. Finally, &sect; 46.2-1571 did not suffer from unconstitutional vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The threshold question was whether Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-406(A)(i) conferred jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reporter and the newspaper intervened in the criminal case, seeking an order for the trial court to unseal the court file. They claimed that the sealing order violated the federal and state constitutions and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-208, which provided that court records be open for public inspection. Following the trial court's order, the reporter and the newspaper unsuccessfully sought a writ of mandamus ordering the trial court to vacate the order. When that petition was denied, the reporter and the newspaper filed the instant appeal. However, the Court of Appeals of Virginia did not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the reporter and the newspaper were not aggrieved by and did not appeal from a final conviction in the trial court under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-406(A)(i). Furthermore, the trial court's order to remove the exhibits and place the copies under seal was not a purely criminal matter falling under the intermediate court's jurisdiction under &sect; 17.1-406(A)(i).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his convictions should have been reversed because the trial court-in a prior proceeding-allegedly erred in allowing the Commonwealth to nolle prosequi indictments alleging identical charges. The prosecutor moved the trial court to nolle prosequi the charges in the prior proceeding because of a witness's last-minute retraction. Defendant claimed that the new indictments alleging the same charges in the later proceeding should have been dismissed with prejudice. However, the appellate court held that, consistent with the common law background of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-265.3, Virginia trial courts properly refused a nolle prosequi when the circumstances manifested a vindictive intent, resulting in oppressive and unfair trial tactics or other prosecutorial misconduct. Absent such mischief, however, courts deferred to the public prosecutor given his constitutionally recognized prerogatives. The presence or absence of good cause in the prior proceeding could not have been collaterally reviewed by the trial court in the later proceeding. It changed nothing that, in the earlier proceeding, an unsuccessful continuance motion preceded the motion for nolle prosequi.</SPAN></P>

A police officer, who responded to a call that someone was on the property, also testified that he found defendant on the property. On appeal, the court found that (1) defendant did not have standing to mount a facial challenge to the constitutionality of City of Falls Church, Va., City Code &sect; 28-72, and his as-applied challenge was barred under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12; (2) City of Falls Church, Va., City Code &sect; 28-72 did not violate the Dillon Rule because the city acted under its express and implied authority when it enacted the ordinance, pursuant to Va.

The Circuit Court of Giles County (Virginia) denied defendant's motion to set aside the verdict and imposed the jury's recommended sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court violated his due process rights by requiring him to show that he possessed or manufactured explosive materials or devices for an educational purpose, a scientific purpose, or any lawful purpose, thereby unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof to him, in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the last clause of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-85, constituted a statutory defense for which defendant bore the burden of providing evidence. The facts needed to establish the subject exception were necessarily and peculiarly within the knowledge of defendant. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the evidence, because the Commonwealth failed to prove that what defendant possessed was not &quot;fireworks&quot; as defined by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 27-95. The appellate court disagreed, noting that defendant's testimony that he specifically set out to manufacture the explosive substance used in fire bombs in London support a finding that he produced or manufactured prohibited explosive material or devises rather than fireworks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in requiring him to present evidence in order to be found guilty. From the evidence presented, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not required defendant to present evidence to find him not guilty. Instead, the trial court properly relied on the statutory rebuttable presumption from which it could find, but was not required to find, that defendant had the intent to defraud when he presented the worthless checks for payment to the store owner and properly imposed on the Commonwealth the ultimate burden of persuasion. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he issued the checks with the intent to defraud. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the record reflected that defendant gave the bad checks to his mother, to cash at her place of employment; defendant left Virginia shortly after presenting the checks for payment, leaving no forwarding address; and the store owner sent defendant, by certified mail, two letters notifying defendant the check were not paid and defendant thereafter did not pay the amount due within five days, as required by Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion in limine to not allow testimony from an attorney contacted by the victims, as the testimony was irrelevant and inflammatory. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the statements defendant made to the attorney denying he employed the victims and stating that he was not going to pay them and did not have to because they were illegal aliens were clearly relevant, as the statements had a tendency to establish defendant's original intent not to pay the men. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing his jury instruction on the definition of &quot;intent to defraud,&quot; because enough evidence was presented to justify giving the jury instruction. The appellate court agreed that the trial court erred in finding that the term &quot;intent to defraud&quot; did not need further definition. The issue was clearly raised by the evidence, as the only contested issue before the trial court was defendant's intent in his failure to pay. Moreover, no less than three mutually exclusive theories were raised relating to the Commonwealth's burden of proof with regard tot he time when the intent to defraud had to exist.</SPAN></P>

He said the language in the e-mails did not meet the definition of &quot;obscene.&quot; The appellate court held sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction because (1) the common definition of the word &quot;obscene&quot; more accurately encompassed the type of communicative conduct proscribed by the statute, namely, that which was obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent, than did a definition in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-372, which was actually a definition of pornography, and (2) a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the language defendant used in his e-mails to the victim fit the common definition. Due process did not bar the application of this common definition of &quot;obscene&quot; to defendant's conduct, when the word had been defined differently in a prior appellate decision, because the criminalization of the conduct resulting in defendant's conviction predated that decision, which dealt with a different criminal statute and remained subject to the appellate court's en banc review, as well as review by the Virginia Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court was, therefore, without authority to acquit defendant of grand larceny and enter a conviction for petit larceny. None of the trial court's sources of authority, the Virginia Constitution, the common law, or specific legislative enactments authorized the trial court to find defendant guilty of a misdemeanor despite its finding that the value of the stolen property was over $200. Thus, the trial court correctly held it had no authority, constitutional, common law, or statutory, to acquit defendant of grand larceny after finding the evidence proved her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court of Arlington County (Virginia) denied defendant's motion to suppress, a jury convicted defendant of abduction with intent to defile pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-48. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed. A panel affirmed the conviction. The appellate court then ordered rehearing en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers saw defendant sexually assault a victim while she walked on a public sidewalk. Defendant claimed that this evidence was inadmissible under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because it was obtained as a result of the officers' use of a GPS device that they placed on his employer's work van, being driven by defendant, without a warrant. The appellate court disagreed. The officers' investigation of recent unsolved sexual assaults in the region pointed to defendant as the likely perpetrator, based on the unique modus operandi in the assaults and the locations. The exclusionary rule did not bar the eyewitness testimony of the officers who saw the sexual assault, which was a new and distinct offense, and sufficiently independent of any information obtained by them from the GPS. The officers' focus on defendant, a registered sex offender on probation, as the likely perpetrator of the recent assaults did not begin with the placement of the GPS device on the van. The officers' observations of the assault were sufficiently attenuated from any argued taint arising from the placement and use of the GPS device.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile pleaded guilty to felony vandalism. His plea agreement expressly waived his statutory right of appeal to the circuit court. The juvenile filed an appeal, which the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County (Virginia). Juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile argued, inter alia, he had a statutory right under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-296(A) to an appeal from the juvenile court to the circuit court and as a matter of law, this right could not be waived. The court of appeals disagreed. It would be anomalous that the most venerable constitutional rights could be implicitly waived but this particular statutory right could not be expressly waived. Most courts were persuaded that because other important constitutional rights of the defendant could be waived by plea agreement, the right to appeal, which was not even guaranteed by the Constitution, but by statute, should also be subject to waiver. The circuit court found juvenile knowingly and intelligently waived his right of appeal under &sect; 16.1-296(A) and properly dismissed the juvenile's appeal. The juvenile did not claim the prosecutor, the district court, or anyone else coerced him into making the agreement. Nor did he contend the agreement was in any way unconscionable. Instead, the juvenile merely asserted the circuit court should have declared the agreement unenforceable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
