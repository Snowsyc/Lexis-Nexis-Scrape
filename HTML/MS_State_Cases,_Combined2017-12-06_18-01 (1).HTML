</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision by the Winston County Circuit Court, Mississippi, which convicted him of felony DUI and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, after being stopped for driving erratically, submitted to an intoxilyzer test, which showed that his blood alcohol content was above the legal limit. He was charged for DUI and at his trial, evidence was introduced that he had two prior DUI convictions within five years of the new offense. He was convicted of felony DUI and sentenced to two years of confinement. He sought review and argued that the intoxilyzer results were within the margin of error, that trial court erred in admitting affidavits, and that the trial court erred in sentencing the defendant as a felony. The court affirmed. It found that the margin of error for the intoxilyzer was not properly before the court since it was a new argument and not reflected in the record. The citation and affidavit for running a stop sign were admissible because the officer was cross-examined and the citation was relevant to time of the traffic stop. The court did not err when it sentenced the appellant as a felony DUI because his two prior misdemeanor DUI convictions did not require representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the felony DUI conviction and sentence because an uncounseled DUI conviction, for which counsel was not constitutionally required, could be used to enhance punishment upon a subsequent DUI conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction for third offense shoplifting, defendant appealed, asserting guard's testimony about items recovered from defendant was insufficient proof of ownership, error in jury instruction improperly shifting burden of proof, and jury was not allowed to pass on validity of prior convictions, a necessary element. The court held guard's relationship with business, and comparison work on the items, was competent. Defendant failed to object to instruction at trial. Although not now allowed, the procedure of not having jury pass on prior convictions was at defendant's specific urging, in his motion in limine asking such evidence be excluded during trial, to gain a tactical advantage, to deny the jury knowledge of prior convictions for similar offenses. Any error was provoked by the defendant himself. It did not rise to an unconstitutional denial of the right to trial by jury. The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of capital rape and sentence of life in prison by the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital rape and sentenced to life in prison. Evidence of defendant's other acts with the victim was admissible because it tended to show the relationship between the parties. Evidence of acts subsequent to defendant's arrest was not admissible, but the admission was harmless error as all the evidence overwhelmingly supported the conviction. The jury instructions were valid, read as a whole and based on the wide recognition of the meaning of the terms used. Defense counsel's actions did not interfere with the jury reaching the proper verdict as dictated by the evidence, and so was not ineffective. Defendant's sentence was imposed under an outdated statute because the judge did not consider the amendment to the statute that took effect before defendant's sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed because the challenged evidence relating to other acts was properly admitted, the jury instructions were proper, and defendant was afforded effective assistance of counsel; sentence was vacated and remanded because it was not imposed under the proper statute.</SPAN></P>
