XIV, &sect; 1, Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court did not err in granting the county summary judgment because employees failed to meet their burden to set forth specific facts showing that the county commission's decision to treat them disparately was unreasonable or not rationally related to a legitimate government interest; [2]-The commission determined that a cap on the county's contribution to employee insurance benefits was needed to remedy a budget shortfall; [3]-The decision to cap benefits was rationally related to the legitimate legislative interest of balancing the budget.</SPAN></P>

The State had a legitimate interest in requiring a parent to contribute to the support of his or her children, and it was rational to conclude that the parent's support obligation would not be reduced due to the income of a non-parent who took on the responsibility of caring for someone else's child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prisoner filed a petition for certiorari naming as respondents the Commissioner of the Department of Correction and others (TDOC) allegedly responsible for determining his eligibility for parole.

The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) granted TDOC's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prisoner argued, inter alia, that trial court erred in dismissing his case for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. The court of appeals agreed. Any written request which made the agency aware of the substance of the controversy and asked the agency to act in accordance with a suggested course of action was sufficient. Prisoner's request for appeal to TDOC clearly raised the issue of whether the TDOC was calculating his sentence and his eligibility for parole in contravention of Howell v. State. Further, it asked TDOC to act in accordance with Howell and to not base eligibility for parole on his aggregate sentence. TDOC denied prisoner's request and told him that the decision was final and that there was no further avenue of appeal. The request for appeal on the basis of Howell and the letter denying appeal satisfied the requirement of requesting a declaratory order from the agency prior to filing what the trial court treated as a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Madison County (Tennessee) affirmed the determination of appellee State Board of Equalization that appellant taxpayer's leasehold interest in tax-exempt property belonging to an Industrial Development Board (IDB) of appellee city was not exempt from ad valorem taxation where the parties had executed a payment in lieu of taxes agreement under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-53-305 (1993 &amp; 1998). The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a corporation that operated property leased from the IDB. The taxpayer entered into an agreement with the city and appellee county that provided for payments in lieu of taxes (PILs). The taxpayer challenged the county's determination that its leasehold interest was not exempt from taxation. The court stated that the dispositive issue was whether &sect; 7-53-305 permitted PILs of any amount by a taxpayer not within the enumerated categories to be made in lieu of all ad valorem taxes on the taxpayer's leasehold interest. Section 305(b), as it existed during the relevant period, was ambiguous with respect to which it provided relief from ad valorem taxation of leasehold interests. In light of the ambiguity, the court examined the purpose of the act establishing industrial development corporations. The court found nothing to suggest that the legislature intended a blanket exemption from taxation upon payment of a minimal PIL. The taxpayer's PILs served to reduce the taxable value of the taxpayer's leasehold interest, but did not entirely exempt the taxpayer from ad valorem taxes on its leasehold interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sex offender brought an action against the defendant Director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and others (TBI) seeking a declaration that the Tennessee Sexual Offender and Violent Sexual Offender Registration, Verification and Tracking Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-39-201 et seq, was unconstitutional as applied to him. The Chancery Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee) granted TBI's motion to dismiss. Sex offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sex offender argued, inter alia, that he should not be required to register under the Tennessee Sexual Offender and Violent Sexual Offender Registration, Verification and Tracking Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-39-201 et seq, (Act) because his criminal convictions occurred in other states prior to the passage of the Act, and the requirements of Act, as applied, violated his rights under the prohibition of ex post facto laws under Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The court of appeals disagreed. The Act was enacted to protect the welfare of the people of Tennessee and not to further punish the offenders. There was a clear and rational non-punitive interest in the State of Tennessee's desire to inform the public of sex offender's history of sexual offenses. The registration requirement of the Act was not excessive with respect to its non-punitive purpose. And, sex offender did not state any reasons why requiring him to register would be more excessive than for any of the other thousands of sexual offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his complaint for a wrongful foreclosure action against appellee lender, appellant debtor sought $ 200,000 in compensatory damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages. A jury awarded him $ 750,000 in compensatory damages and $ 300,000 in punitive damages. The Circuit Court for Carter County, Tennessee, reduced his compensatory damage award to $ 200,000 and affirmed the punitive damage award. The debtor sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reduced the debtor's compensatory damages in accordance with Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.02 as he was limited to the damages that he pled. The court found that the debtor waived his challenge to the constitutionality of Rule 15.02. He failed to notify the attorney general of his challenge, and he did not raise the issue before the trial court. The debtor did not file a motion to amend the amount he demanded in his complaint. He argued that the issue of damages over $ 200,000 was tried by express or implied consent. The court was unpersuaded as the language of Rule 15.02 allowing amendment by consent did not allow the debtor to avoid the specific prohibition in Rule 15.02 against amendment after the verdict so as to increase the amount sued for in the action. Further, the court found that the specific prohibition in Rule 15.02 was not subject to waiver. Thus, the lender's introduction of a settlement offer it made to the debtor was not a waiver and an implied agreement to the amendment of the amount demanded. The trial court did not err in reducing the compensatory damages award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of a decision of the Tennessee Claims Commission, which awarded a judgment in favor of appellees, the State of Tennessee, the Tennessee Department of Child Services (DCS), and employees of the State. The parents had set forth the wrongful death action by alleging that the State negligently caused the drowning of their six-month old infant while in the care of a placement caretaker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wrongful death action was filed in the Commission by the parents of the infant after he drowned in a bathtub while in the care of a friend of the family identified in a DCS safety plan as the placement caretaker. The friend left the infant unattended in the bathtub while she was otherwise occupied in an adjacent room. The issues were whether the infant was in the care, custody and control of the DCS so as to provide jurisdiction to the Commission; whether the DCS's case recordings, some of which were made more than a month after the event they purported to record, were inadmissible hearsay; and whether it was foreseeable to the DCS that the friend would leave the helpless infant unattended in a bathtub and let him drown. The court determined that the Commission properly found that it had jurisdiction because the DCS had control of the infant even though it did not have custody. However, the court held that the Commission erred in admitting one case recording that was completed over a month after the event that it was purported to record. Additionally, the Commission erred in finding that the infant's drowning and death was not foreseeable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Commission was affirmed with regard to the determination that it had subject matter jurisdiction and the admission of all but one of the case recordings. The decision was overruled with regard to an inadmissible case recording and the holding that the State could not be liable because the death of the infant was not foreseeable is vacated. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, finding that the raw materials underwent processing at least as extensive, and usually more extensive, than that of milling wheat into flour. The transformation of the product of the soil to the raw materials included changes in name, appearance, and consistency. The raw materials were not products of the soil entitled to the exemption under &sect; 28. The taxpayer then argued that it was exempt as the raw materials were manufactured from the produce of Tennessee or any other state under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 30 and &sect; 67-5-216(a). The raw materials were not articles manufactured by the taxpayer itself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court found that there was abundant evidence of the mother's mental incompetence. The mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, and borderline personality disorder. Additionally, the mother had at least three in-patient psychiatric hospitalizations, and had been treated for years with counseling and medication. Accordingly, clear and convincing evidence showed that the mother was mentally incompetent to parent her children and was likely to remain incompetent for the foreseeable future. Thus, the trial court properly terminated her parental rights on this basis. Next, the instant court found that a number of the best interest factors weighed against the mother. The instant court reasoned that the mother failed to effect a lasting adjustment after years of services by various social services agencies. Additionally, the mother allowed numerous individuals who presented a threat to her children to reside with her, her house was overrun with cockroaches, at times her utilities were shut off, and she remained delusional and mentally incompetent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee filed an action against defendants, a county, a sheriff's department, and officers, for denying him liberty without due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Circuit Court for Bradley County, Tennessee, entered partial summary judgment for the arrestee, finding that defendants violated Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-11-150, and it amounted to a constitutional violation. The court granted an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee presented himself to the sheriff's department pursuant to an arrest warrant, which provided for his release from jail on bond. He was able and willing to post the bond, but he was informed that because the allegations against him involved domestic violence, the department was required to hold him in custody for 12 hours after his arrest before he could post bond. Upon review, the court found that before an arrestee could be held for 12 hours under &sect; 40-11-150(h), a magistrate had to find that he was a threat to a victim, public safety, or a bail risk under &sect; 40-11-150(a). As there was no such finding in the arrestee's case, &sect; 40-11-150(h) had not been triggered, and the court affirmed the finding that defendants violated the statute. However, the court found that the arrestee's constitutional rights to due process were not violated by defendants' mistake as to the meaning of &sect; 40-11-150(h). The fact that he was held for 12 hours before being released on bail did not automatically constitute a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that defendants violated &sect; 40-11-150. The court reversed the trial court's finding that the violation of the statute deprived the arrestee of his due process rights. The court remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, which operated a chain of restaurants in Tennessee, contested additional franchise taxes assessed on the value of land and buildings that it leased from a company commonly owned with the taxpayer. That company already had paid franchise taxes. The court held that the taxpayer and the company were not affiliated within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2004(2) due to ownership of the taxpayer and the affiliated company by the same natural individuals. Those individuals could not qualify as &quot;persons&quot; that could be affiliated under the franchise tax law because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2004(34) defined &quot;person&quot; or &quot;taxpayer&quot; to include business entities but not natural individuals. The companies were not being subjected to impermissible double taxation because the franchise tax was paid for the privilege of doing business in Tennessee and both companies were doing business in Tennessee.  Because the companies were not affiliated, the taxpayer had no standing to argue that affiliated companies with negative net worth such as the taxpayer were treated differently than companies with positive net worth that could be assessed franchise taxes based on net worth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner filed a declaratory judgment action to challenge respondent department of correction's denial of his request for a parole hearing. When no action was taken after the department's answer and the petitioner failed to set a date for a final hearing, the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) dismissed the complaint without prejudice and denied the petitioner's subsequent summary judgment motion. The petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was convicted in 1975 and 1976 of eight felonies, including armed robbery with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to commit murder, and second degree murder. He received a life sentence for second degree murder, consecutive with his other sentences, In June 1978, the petitioner was released on extended furlough which required him to report regularly to his parole counselor and to obtain permission before leaving the state. The petitioner moved to California without permission and committed other crimes. After the petitioner's return to Tennessee prisons in 1985, he repeatedly requested parole hearings on his life sentence. His requests were denied on the basis that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-123(b)(1) prevented parole after violation of a conditional release. The petitioner alleged that the statute applied only to his armed robbery convictions. The trial court properly found that, because the summary judgment motion was filed over a year after entry of the final order dismissing the complaint, it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petitioner's summary judgment motion. The dismissal order was plainly a final judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellants owners' grandfathered billboard was destroyed, appellee department authorized the owners to rebuild the billboard using like materials pursuant to Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1680-2-3-.04(2). The department filed a notice of charges stating the new billboard failed to comply with the regulation because it was not rebuilt with like materials. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) agreed. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended on appeal that the billboard was in compliance with the regulation and that the subsequent removal of the billboard constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation. The court held that the administrative interpretation controlled unless it was plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation itself. Therefore, courts gave great deference and controlling weight to an agency's interpretation of its own rules.  Here, the owners used a steel post to rebuild the billboard in place of the original wooden one, and to allow a steel pole to replace a thirty-year-old wooden post was contrary to the stated purpose of the Federal Highway Beautification Act, 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131, the Billboard Regulation and Control Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 54-21-101 et seq., and both the federal and state regulatory schemes. Accordingly, in light of the fact that an agency's interpretation of its regulations was given great deference, the board's commissioner's interpretation of &quot;like materials&quot; was reasonable and not in excess of his statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the county mayor improperly rescheduled a county Board meeting. The defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6), or in the alternative, motions for summary judgment. The trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs did not have standing for a private right of action. The plaintiffs did not allege a special interest or injury that resulted from the alleged actions of the defendants. The trial court found that in the nature of a quo warranto, the plaintiffs failed to establish any injury in fact caused by the actions of the defendants, and thus, lacked standing. The trial court properly rejected the plaintiffs arguments that quo warranto cases brought pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-35-110, without the consent of the district attorney general, did not require a special interest or injury for standing. The plaintiffs failed to show a distinct and palpable injury. Without finding that the plaintiffs had established any injury at all, even if there was any such injury, it would be an injury only to an interest that the plaintiffs shared in common with all other citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before buying land, appellant corporation received appellee city's assurance for support of the land's annexation and rezoning. When the city refused to go forward with the annexation and rezoning until a comprehensive land use plan was completed, the corporation sued the city asserting that the refusal constituted an unconstitutional moratorium. The Chancery Court for Maury County (Tennessee) dismissed the complaint. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation asserted that the trial court erred in granting the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court held a municipality could properly refuse a building permit for a land use in a newly annexed area when such use was repugnant to a pending and later enacted zoning ordinance. Further, resolutions or ordinances of the type here considered were referred to in cases from other jurisdictions as &quot;stopgap&quot; ordinances, &quot;interim&quot; ordinances, and as &quot;emergency&quot; ordinances because of their function and purpose to preserve temporarily the status quo of the municipality or section thereof to which they apply until a pending permanent zoning regulation could be finally adopted. Here, the corporation was the party asking to change the status quo. Without the concurrence of the city the corporation had only the right to build one residential unit per acre. All the city did was not accept the proposed change until it could study it carefully in light of detailed standards. Thus, the city did not violate corporation's rights by refusing to evaluate the corporation's request for rezoning until it could evaluate that request in light of a comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department asserted that the appeal should have been dismissed because the issue was no longer justiciable as &sect; 55-4-226(f) was amended during the pendency of this dispute and presently in effect allowed former municipal court judges, whether appointed or elected, to have judicial license plates. The appellate court agreed. The 2004 statute was superseded on July 1, 2009, while the case was pending in the trial court. Regrettably, it appeared that the parties and the chancery court were unaware of the 2009 amendment. The 2009 amendment to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of five counts of indecent exposure under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-511 when indecent exposure was not classified as a sexual offense. Three years after his convictions, the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) found that the retroactive application of the Tennessee Sexual Offender Registration, Verification, and Tracking Act of 2004, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-39-201 et seq., was constitutional. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner was convicted, the Sexual Offender Registration and Monitoring Act of 1994 was in effect. The 1994 Act did not classify indecent exposure as a sexual offense. Unlike the prior Act, the 2004 Act classified persons convicted of at least three indecent exposure offenses as sexual offenders. It required all persons classified as sexual offenders to register with the sex offender registry, and it prohibited sexual offenders whose victims were minors from working or residing within 1,000 feet of a school, child care facility, or public park. The victim of one of petitioner's convictions was a minor. The 2004 Act was part of a nonpunitive regulatory framework that did not constitute punishment. Therefore, the classification, registration, and employment restraint provisions of the 2004 Act, as retroactively applied to petitioner, were constitutional and did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, cl. 1 or Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer, an interstate water transportation carrier company, was assessed an ad valorem tax on personal property by appellee treasurer. The taxpayer appealed to the Tennessee State Board of Equalization Assessment Appeals Commission. The taxpayer was then retroactively assessed for the two tax years preceding the original assessment. The assessments were upheld and the taxpayer sought the court's review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer asserted on appeal that the tax imposed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-1301, as applied to it, violated the federal and state constitutions, and that taxes assessed pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1002 were imposed in retaliation for its appeal. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 67-5-1301 because it was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to the services provided by the state. The court further held that governmental action could be a tort if motivated in substantial part by a desire to punish an individual for exercising a constitutional right. The retroactive assessments were imposed after the taxpayer had exercised its right under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-1327 to appeal the original assessment, and the taxpayer was the only water  carrier of the seven originally assessed that exercised its statutory right to appeal and was the only one assessed back taxes. That evidence was sufficient to infer that the reexamination of the taxpayer's operations prior to the original assessment was prompted by the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed to the extent that it upeld the ad valorem property tax assessments against the taxpayer for the tax years 2005-2008. The judgment was reversed regarding the Commission's decision to uphold the assessments for the years 2003 and 2004.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sued on behalf of all who had not been fully refunded and who had not reached a formal, final settlement of their refund. The trial court ordered the Department to turn certain information regarding purported class members over to the taxpayers under seal. On appeal, the Department alleged that the taxpayers' sole remedies were specifically set forth in the Taxpayer Remedies Statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1801 et seq. The taxpayers alleged that, although not specifically set forth in the statute, a class action was an option. The appellate court agreed with the Department that, if the legislature intended to permit a class action, it would have included that option in the statute. Because the trial court's certification of the class disregarded the explicit procedures for challenging tax liabilities established by the legislature, the certification was improper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed that under &sect; 67-4-2109(e)(1), no job tax credit was available to taxpayers claiming the credit as successor entities. As &sect; 67-4-2109(e)(1) was in effect when the taxpayer's liability was determined, the trial court properly applied it and did not thereby violate Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20's ban on retrospective laws, because &sect; 67-4-2109(e)(1) neither impaired the obligation of contracts nor affected vested rights. Even assuming the taxpayer would have been entitled to its predecessor's unused credits under prior law, that eligibility was eliminated when &sect; 67-4-2109(e)(1) was enacted, and any unused credits were lost. As the Commissioner prevailed on the matters in controversy, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1803(d) she was entitled to attorney's fees and expenses incurred in the trial court and on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of the attorney's fees and expenses the Commissioner was entitled to recover.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following entry of the order, the mother appealed to the circuit court. After several years, the case was transferred and the appeal was dismissed. The mother again appealed and the circuit court transferred the matter to the court of appeals. The circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and, thus, its orders were null and void. Accordingly, only the issues with respect to the juvenile court proceedings were considered. The appellate record consisted only of the technical record; there was no transcript or statement of the evidence. Accordingly, a presumption arose that sufficient evidence supported the juvenile court's findings. Because the mother refused to accept that her accusations of sexual abuse against the father were unfounded and because the mother's repeated accusations were destructive to the father's relationship with the child, the juvenile court did not err in designating the father as the primary residential parent. However, the juvenile court erred in not including a grant of residential parenting time to the mother. The juvenile court's factual findings did not justify precluding the mother from having any visitation whatsoever.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the designation of the father as the primary residential parent, but reversed that portion of the order relating to parenting time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the administratrix of a decedent's estate, filed an action against defendant nursing home, asserting claims of negligence and wrongful death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died after being removed from the nursing home. The nursing home filed a motion for an order dismissing the administratrix's complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. It also moved to stay all proceedings, arguing that all claims were barred by the parties' alternative dispute resolution (ADR) agreement. The nursing home argued that the trial court erred in declaring invalid the durable power of attorney the decedent executed and thereby also invalidating the ADR agreement signed by the her attorney-in-fact. The court of appeals held that there was no motion in the record praying the trial court to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-5-303 (2000), and there was no order in the record denying a motion made under &sect; 29-5-303. The nursing home filed its motion in the trial court pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) and 56 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-5-301 et seq. (2000). However, nowhere in its motion did it move the trial court to stay the proceedings and to compel arbitration.

The Commission observed that the signatures on a towing slip and letter that purportedly belonged to an individual clearly did not match. The Commission found the operator guilty of towing a vehicle without proper authorization and suspended his license for 12 months, in part, for two counts of violating Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-16-112. Transportation Licensing Commission of Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County Rule 24 provided that there could be no relationship between the agent of a property owner designated to authorize towing from private property without consent of the vehicle owner and the towing company. Rule 24 was not unconstitutionally vague. The individual who allegedly signed the slip was the sister of the operator's employee and she apparently resided at the same home as the operator, or at least used his mailing address. A person exercising ordinary common sense would understand that the individual was a person with whom the operator had some relationship.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed, holding that the corporation was never before the trial court as a party. Without jurisdiction, the orders entered in the matter were void.

Two experts opined that the pre-operative reports clearly showed that the patient had Keratoconus and that any doctor complying with the standard of care should have known of his condition. Even assuming that appellants did not know of the patient's condition prior to surgery, there was at least a question of fact as to their knowledge and possible fraudulent concealment after the surgery. An expert opined that appellants misled the patient in informing him that the surgery was successful and by telling him years after the surgery that it had no harmful effect on his vision. The patient had to prove actual knowledge of the condition in order to proceed under fraudulent concealment, and it was not enough for him to show that appellants should have known.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, builders, sought review of the decision of the Chancery Court for Henderson County (Tennessee), which found in favor of appellees, homeowners, and awarded them damages under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-18-101 et seq., and arising from the builders' breach of warranty and contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a construction action, the builders appealed the trial court's award of damages to the homeowners pursuant to the TCPA, and stemming from the builders' breach of warranty and contract. The appellate court affirmed. Because it could not be found that Henderson County was an exempt county under Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 62-6-102(D) (2002), there was sufficient proof, beyond a licensing issue, from which the trial court could have concluded that the builders' practices were in violation of the TCPA. There was also ample evidence to support the finding that the builders acted in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-18-104(b)(7) by representing that the goods and services were of a particular standard, while they were not, and in violation of &sect; 47-18-104(b)(27) by engaging in deceptive acts and practices. Consequently, the trial court did not err in awarding the homeowners' attorney fees under the TCPA. The preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's award of $ 52,804.75 in attorney fees and $ 11,297.82 in expenses. It was clear that no waiver of the implied warranty of good workmanship and material was present in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and remanded for a determination of attorney fees. Costs of the appeal were assessed against the builders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant distributor sought review of an order of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) dismissing its action against appellee manufacturer, which sought an injunction and declaratory judgment following the manufacturer's termination of its sales and service agreement with the distributor without cause. The distributor asserted that the termination violated the Tennessee Dealer Protection Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-1301 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-1302, a 1999 amendment to the Tennessee Dealer Protection Act, manufacturers were prohibited from terminating a dealer's relationship with the manufacturer without cause. The provision was inapplicable to the parties in the instant action because the operative agreement between the parties predated the 1999 amendment. The controlling agreement between the parties was entered into in 1992. Contrary to the distributor's contention, the parties did not mutually assent to a new agreement after 1999, and the 1992 agreement was not modified or amended by mutual assent or course of dealing at any time after 1999. Accordingly, the 1992 agreement was still the operative agreement between the parties. Because Tennessee law permitted the manufacturer to exercise its right under the 1992 agreement to terminate the distributor without cause when the 1992 agreement was entered into, it would have been an unconstitutional impairment of the manufacturer's contractual rights under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, to apply the current Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-1302 to the 1992 agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father asserted that the trial court erred by failing to apply the superior parental rights doctrine in this case. The father asserted that he did not waive his superior parental rights to his children, and that the trial court erroneously applied the change in material circumstance test to this custody modification case. The father additionally asserted, in the alternative, that the trial court erred in finding that a material change in circumstance had not occurred since entry of the prior custody order. The instant court found that the trial court's conclusion that the parenting plan entered in May 2007 was intended by the parties to be a permanent custody order that replaced the prior temporary order simply was not supported by the plain language of the plan. Rather, the language of the parenting plan supported a conclusion that it was a mediated compromise intended to modify the temporary order of custody by establishing a parenting schedule and delineating rights and obligations.</SPAN></P>

Further, in light of the offer of proof contained in the record, and in light of the entirety of the circumstances of this case, the instant court agreed that the preferences of the child must be considered by the court in order to determine whether modification of the parenting plan was in the children's best interest, as opposed to their parents'. Next, the instant court found that the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the wife was voluntarily unemployed where it was undisputed that the wife made no attempt to rehabilitate herself or to seek employment outside the home.</SPAN></P>

However, the Commission should not be viewed as a governing body subject to the Open Meetings Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-44-101 et seq. The employee's claim that the trial court failed to indicate any substantial and material evidence upon which the commission relied to reach its decision was rejected. Access to city-owned computer equipment was to be used exclusively for business purposes and the employee had no legitimate business reason for accessing the officer's confidential information to inquire about her husband's arrest and doing so violated city policy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the City of Memphis, Tennessee (city) and the Memphis City Council (city council), sought judicial review of a writ of mandamus from the Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) ordering the city to restore funding to the Memphis City Schools (schools) for the 2008-09 school year in compliance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-2-203 and 49-3-314. The writ was granted pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the statutorily mandated school funding provisions contained in &sect;&sect; 49-3-314(c) and 49-2-203(a)(10)(A)(ii), the anti-supplanting statutes, and the maintenance of effort (MOE) provisions, were applicable to the city, as a local government. The city charter authorized the city to provide funding to the schools through an ad valorem tax. The city argued unsuccessfully that it was not required to provide funding to the schools under either its charter or the general education statutes. Section 773 of the city charter clearly reflected the General Assembly's intention that the city assume some obligation for funding of the schools though an ad valorem tax. The city also argued unsuccessfully that it was not a local government for the purposes of the general education statutes, and that the statutory scheme applied only to the county governments. The city was governed by the anti-supplanting provisions found in the Tennessee Code and the MOE rule. Both the county and the city were required to fund the schools in conformance with the Basic Education Program, the anti-supplanting statutes, and the MOE provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from an order of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) granting summary judgment in favor of respondents, a warden and the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Corrections (TDOC), and denying the inmate's motion to alter or amend in the inmate's declaratory judgment action, arguing that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-25-143 (2006) was unconstitutionally applied retroactively to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was found guilty of various crimes and the court costs from his criminal trial were billed in part to the State. Three years later, the State informed the inmate that, in accordance with &sect; 40-25-143, TDOC would begin deducting amounts from his inmate trust fund account to reimburse the State. Section 40-25-143 became effective one month after the inmate's criminal trial. He asserted that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-25-129(1), he acquired a vested interest in having the State pay the court costs billed in his criminal trial and, therefore, TDOC was estopped to collect funds from his trust account. However, the statutory exceptions in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-25-129 were permissive, and not mandatory derogations from the general rule. Section 40-25-129 states that a criminal court may bill costs to the State when a felony prosecution has proceeded to a verdict; it does not require the criminal court to do so. Even if costs were billed to the State, subsequent recovery from the convicted defendant was not precluded pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-25-123(a) (2006). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher appealed his termination by the board pursuant to Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect; 49-5-511(a)(1), (2) (2009). The teacher's actions involved, allegedly, an inappropriate relationship with a minor female student, improper e-mails sent over the school's system, and inaccurate information that the teacher supplied during the investigation of the allegations. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the notice of charges in the memorandum from a department of education director to the board, as supplemented by the interviews of the teacher, were sufficient to allow him to prepare his defense. Further, the findings and decision were legally sufficient under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-5-512. There was compelling proof, albeit largely circumstantial, of a sexual relationship between the student and the teacher. Further, the teacher offered no authority for the proposition that a school may not interfere with nonsexual association between a student and a teacher based on concerns of parents, even if the concerns were exaggerated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town sought review of a judgment from the chancery court for Roane County (Tennessee), which found in favor of defendant town and dismissed plaintiff's action seeking to void defendant's referendum without reaching the issue of priority. The action involved a contest between plaintiff and defendant, which were neighboring towns, over a common territory that both purported to have annexed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant sought to add the territory through a referendum election, plaintiff used its annexation ordinance. Plaintiff asserted that its ordinance took priority because it , was granted statutory priority. Defendant argued that plaintiff's ordinance was of no effect. Upon review, the court held that, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-58-111(c) (Supp. 2009), provided an exception to the general rule against expanding outside a growth plan that allowed a municipality to annex outside its urban growth boundary. A municipality qualified for that exception by following the procedure in &sect; 6-58-111(d). To follow the procedure of &sect; 6-58-111(d) the municipality had to first propose an amendment to its urban growth boundary or conduct its annexation by referendum. Finally, a municipality qualified under &sect; 6-58-111(d)(1) if it has acted under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-58-104(d)(1) to propose an amendment to the growth plan by filing an appropriate notice. Thus, trial court erred in finding that a municipality had to amend its urban growth boundary following the procedures in &sect; 6-58-104 and plaintiff qualified under &sect; 6-58-111(d)(1) to annex by ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grantor created a trust. A separate entity was created from the trust. The trust held a fifty percent ownership interest in the separate entity. The grantor consented to the use of the trust's stock for the benefit of the separate entity. The separate entity had an unsecured margin of indebtedness. The trust's stocks were pledged to a bank in return for a loan to the trust. The trust then transferred the loan monies to the separate entity to pay off its indebtedness. The successor trustee argued that his civil conspiracy claim against defendants was improperly dismissed because the trust agreement's exculpatory clause would not affect defendants. The court of appeals held that the successor trustee mistakenly argued that the trial court's dismissal was founded on the exculpatory clause. The trial court's dismissal of the successor trustee's claims was based on its finding that none of the parties engaged in unlawful conduct. Because the successor trustee did not challenge the trial court's finding that defendants' actions were lawful, it would not address the issue. Without an unlawful act by defendants, the successor trustee's civil conspiracy claim failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner neighborhood residents sought review of a judgment from the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which found in favor of respondents, a local government and the Attorney General for the State of Tennessee (government), in the residents' action challenging the validity of a zoning change based on alleged violations of Tennessee's Open Meeting Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-44-101, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local government began considering legislation to implement a conservation zoning overlay in a neighborhood. The ordinance adopting the zoning change passed on the first and second reading. Prior to the final meeting on the subject, members of the local government sent numerous emails to each other discussing the proposed zoning change. In addition, some members viewed information on the zoning issue in a non-public conference room. Thereafter the zoning change was adopted at a public meeting. Upon review, the court found that the gathering that took place in the back conference room did not violate the Act; however, some of the email correspondence among members of the local government did violate the Act. Nonetheless, after the exchange of emails, the local government members engaged in a new and substantial reconsideration of the issues surrounding the zoning change; thus the ordinance was not deemed void under the Act. Finally, the court found no violation of the separation of powers doctrine or the due process clause under the Tennessee Constitution, and no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decisions on discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the judgment regarding the emails and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judgment debtor filed a motion in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) seeking to quash an execution sale and seeking a hearing on his claim of exemptions. Following the execution sale of his stock to defendant judgment creditor, the debtor sought to have the sale set aside. The trial court denied relief, and the debtor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the case was pending on appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the summary judgment against the debtor in the underlying case, which had led to the judgment that the execution sale was held to enforce. The underlying case, which had been brought by the judgment debtor to enforce a purchase of stock, was remanded for a trial on the merits, with some of the questions to be resolved involving the value of the stock, the ownership of the stock, and even the existence and legitimacy of the stock. The creditor contended that the stock issued by the corporation failed to meet statutory requirements. The question of whether any stock was properly issued led to the question of what was exempt from execution and what was sold. Any effort to resolve the issues in the appeal was dependent upon, and subject to revision by, the determination of facts which were before the trial court in the underlying case. The court held that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-6-112, the interest which the creditor acquired in the debtor's stock was not affected by the Supreme Court's decision. Thus, on remand, the debtor was entitled to seek recovery of the proceeds of sale, but not the shares of stock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for consideration in light of the issues to be determined in the underlying case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners, appealed from the Chancery Court for Bedford County, TN, and challenged an amendment to a zoning ordinance affecting their property on the ground that the content of the published notice was inadequate in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-203. Appellees, the city, a city council, and a planning commission, opposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented required a two-step analysis. First, the court had to determine what type of notice was required in order to amend zoning restrictions under the governing statutes. The second step was then to decide whether the notice published in the local newspaper met this standard. The appellate court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-203(a) required that the published notice of a change in permitted land use must be specific or complete enough to enable the average person to determine whether his or her property might be affected by the proposed change. The point of departure for determining whether the published notice for the ordinance was adequate was the language of the publication itself. Based on the published notice for the ordinance at issue, that landowners in the I-2 zoning district, including the property owners, were not apprised that the proposed amendment might affect their property. Failure to substantially comply with statutory requirements rendered the zoning ordinance invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was reversed and the ordinance was declared invalid. Costs of the appeal were taxed to the city, the city council, and the planning commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a corporation that operated through several divisions, including one engaged in the manufacture of decorative plastic parts for automobiles. The taxpayer's corporate headquarters and commercial domicile was St. Louis, Missouri. As part of its business operations, the taxpayer utilized a practice whereby funds not needed for operational purposes were invested in Treasury securities. The state asserted that the interest income from short-term investments in Treasury securities constituted business earnings. The appellate court found that the materials submitted by the taxpayer in support of its motion for summary judgment showed that the income earned from the investment in Treasury securities was not used to fund the operations of the automotive division or to acquire businesses related to, or for the purpose of expanding, the automotive division. The state's speculative contention that the taxpayer used the income earned from the investment in Treasury securities in the operation of the automotive division was not sufficient to create an actual relation between the use of the income and the operations conducted in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners filed an application for rezoning to allow the development of an amusement park. The owners challenged the denial of their application and the validity of Rutherford County, Tenn., Zoning Resolution &sect; 4.05 pursuant to which the county commission required a two-thirds vote for passage of the application. The court found that the rezoning application would substantially affect the use of the land, and thus, even if Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-105 did not apply, the same result would be reached under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-5-109(a), a provision requiring a majority vote for all business before the county legislative body. Neither the county's grant of authority to enact zoning ordinances nor its general legislative authority allowed it to impose a supermajority requirement with respect to zoning amendments. The court held that &sect; 4.05 was not within the Tennessee General Assembly's grant of authority to the county and was therefore ultra vires and avoid ab initio. The owner's zoning application received a majority vote of the commission and should have been declared to have passed. There should not have been an award of attorney fees as there were no constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff entertainment businesses sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which granting defendant local governments' motion to dismiss under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The businesses had filed an action against the governments challenging Metro. Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Code Laws ch. 6.54.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 6.54 governed the licensing and regulation of sexually oriented businesses. The businesses alleged that ch. 6.54 was unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, under the Tennessee Constitution for violations of their rights to free speech, expression, privacy, association, equal protection, and due process. Upon review, the court determined that the businesses failed to state any as applied constitutional claims upon which relief cold be granted because the businesses asserted no facts to support their claims. The claims were devoid of any facts upon which to determined if an as applied challenge existed. The businesses merely asserted broad and vague accusations and legal conclusions. Furthermore, as to the facial challenges, the court held that the businesses' assertion was too vague and nebulous to support a claim for which relief could be granted. The court noted that ch. 6.54 contained 35 definitions and that the businesses failed to identify which of the 35 definitions they contended to be facially invalid under the Tennessee Constitution. The court concluded that the pleading requirements set forth in Tenn. R. Civ. P. 8.05 were not satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Tennessee Department of Revenue (Department) sought review of a judgment from the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which awarded appellee taxpayer a refund, as well as statutory interest, of a tax imposed under the Excise Tax Law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2001, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department assessed an excise tax on the taxpayer, a nondomiciliary subsidiary corporation conducting business in the State of Tennessee, based on income earned outside the State as a result of the parent corporation's redemption of outstanding stock held by the taxpayer. The Department's tax assessment was based on a determination that the income was taxable as business earnings. The court held that while there was evidence of overlap in the management of the entities, the record did not reflect sufficient control on the part of the parent over the taxpayer's activities in Tennessee to support a finding of centralized management for purposes of the hallmarks of a unitary relationship test. In addition, the record did not contain sufficient evidence to prove that the taxpayer realized any benefits as a result of a reorganization or a stock redemption which contributed to the taxpayer's operations or which taxpayer depended on in performing its operation, so as to justify a finding that the parent and the taxpayer were functionally integrated. There was not evidence that the parent provided any central serviced to the taxpayer which undermined its operation independence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile court judge filed suit against appellees, the mayor and the county board of commissioners, challenging a resolution passed by the board that resulted in a second juvenile court division (division 2). The Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) found that &sect; 20 of Chapter 219 of the Private Acts of 1967 (Private Act) was constitutional and lifted a temporary injunction. The judge appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge argued that the trial court erred when it found &sect; 20 of the Private Act to be constitutional and the judge appealed the trial court's order which quashed his discovery request upon the determination that the Open Meetings Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-44-101 et seq., claim was mooted by the board's decision to rescind the resolution. As a judge was a necessary component of a court, in order to ordain and establish a court under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, the legislation creating or establishing the court must make provision for a judge. The legislature could not establish a court without also establishing a judgeship. Since &sect; 20 of the Private Act did not create or establish a judgeship for division 2, it did not effectively create or establish that division or court. Also because in &sect; 20 the legislature delegated to the board the power to decide whether a judge for division 2 was needed, which was the equivalent of delegating to the board the authority to establish or create division 2, &sect; 20 was an unconstitutional delegation of power reserved to the General Assembly by art. VI, &sect; 1. The trial court's dismissal of the Open Meetings Act claim as moot was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the constitutional issue, the trial court was reversed, and &sect; 20 of the Private Act was found to be unconstitutional. Consequently, the resolution enacted pursuant to &sect; 20 was invalid and of no effect. The trial court's dismissal of the Open Meetings Act claim was affirmed. Costs of appeal were assessed against appellees for which execution might issue if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an entertainer and a business, sought review of a judgment from the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which affirmed the decision of appellee Metropolitan Sexually Oriented Business Licensing Board assessing a fine against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inspector cited the entertainer and the business, which was engaged in sexually oriented entertainment, for violating an ordinance governing certain requirements for such entertainers and businesses. The inspector alleged that the entertainer's actions did not occur on a stage as required by Metro. Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Code Laws &sect; 6.54.140(C), and that she was less than three feet away from the customer. The inspector brought the manager into the room and filled out an inspection form stating that the entertainer violated Metro. Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Code Laws &sect; 6.54.140(B) and (C). Another inspection form stated the business violated Metro. Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Code Laws &sect; 6.54.130(A), as well as Metro. Gov't Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., Code Laws &sect; 6.54.140(B) &amp; (C). The Board upheld the citations and issued a fine against the entertainer and the business. The court held that the Board could not assess a fine directly against either the entertainer or the business. However, the ordinances were violated and thus the Board could assess penalties against the entertainer and the business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment finding that the ordinance was violated, reversed the part of the judgment issuing a fine against the entertainer and the business, and remanded the matter to the chancery court with instructions to return the matter to the Board for reconsideration of the penalty to be assessed against the entertainer and the business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged drug dealer was arrested by federal authorities pursuant to an indictment charging him and a co-defendant with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.

The alleged drug dealer brought a constitutional challenge to Tennessee's &quot;Drug Tax.&quot; The supreme court held the tax to be unconstitutional because it could not be classified as either a tax on merchants and peddlers, or a tax on a privilege, as authorized by the Tennessee Constitution. Specifically, the supreme court found that the Drug Tax imposed on &quot;dealers&quot; could not be deemed to be a tax on merchants and peddlers, because the term &quot;dealers&quot; was defined in terms of &quot;possession&quot; of illegal substances, not possession with intent to sell. In other words, the tax is imposed upon the possession, not the merchandising of unauthorized substances, and therefore was not a tax on merchants and peddlers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court chose to award the clerk 5 percent of the purchase price of the sale, well within the 10 percent authorized under the statute. The trial court abused its discretion when it granted the clerk's Tenn. R. Civ. P. 11 motion for sanctions and awarded appellate attorney's fees to the clerk for the trustee's filing of pleadings in connection with the first appeal because the clerk's motion for sanctions was in essence a motion for appellate attorney's fees pursuant to Tenn.

The termination was also not actionable in a claim against the supervisor for interfering with the employment relationship because the employee's violation of the employer's cell phone policy was more than enough to justify termination, even if the supervisor was involved and had some element of ill will. There was a dispute of fact as to whether it was profiling when the authority told the employees to issue a criminal trespass citation or arrest and jail every male between the ages of 18 and 35 that came into a housing development. However, the employees' whistleblower claim failed because there was unrebutted evidence of non-pretextual reasons for the terminations and only circumstantial evidence of a causal connection. The causal connection was sufficiently supported, however, for a claim under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-301.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment for the supervisor on the claim of defamation; affirmed the grant of summary judgment as to the claims against the supervisor for inducement of breach of contract; affirmed summary judgment to the authority as to the whistleblower claims; and vacated summary judgment to the authority as to the claims under the THRA. This case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The service argued that the CMAA Regulations violated equal protection principles by prohibiting only non-registered taxis from conducting curbside passenger pickups, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1; Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and art. XI, &sect; 8. The appellate court found that the Regulations authorized registered taxis to park, wait, and pick up their next fare in a designated taxi zone at the curbside outside the baggage claim area. Taxis not registered were not subject to such regulations and requirements and were effectively removed from access to incoming passengers unless the passengers had made advance reservations. The Regulations were reasonably related to their legitimate purpose of presenting incoming passengers with transportation options, whether they be taxis, limousines, or other vehicles, from providers that were known to CMAA to have vehicles that were relatively new, clean, and in good repair -- conditions imposed upon all permitted commercial ground transportation vehicles. CMAA had taken steps to ensure that incoming passengers who had not made advance arrangements would be presented as a first option with registered and therefore, regulated, transportation providers.</SPAN></P>

The hospital filed a motion for summary judgment claiming Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-6-219 provided qualified immunity for credentialing decisions. The trial court erred by denying the motion. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee held that the plain language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-6-219(d)(1) supported the interpretation that the qualified immunity applied when a patient sued a hospital for a peer review committee's credentialing decision. The qualified immunity defense under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-6-219(d)(1) was constitutional under the open courts clause of the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Bradley County, Tennessee, granted defendant employer summary judgment on plaintiff employee's action to enforce an employment contract for benefits allegedly due under the contract on the grounds that a provision in the employment contract was an unenforceable contract, as the provision amounted to an agreement to agree and dismissed the action. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee asked the appellate court to reverse the granting of summary judgment because the contract provided that the employer would give a 25% ownership interest in a nursing home to the employee, and he argued that the terms of the contract between the parties as to the ownership interest were reasonably certain and provided a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for providing an appropriate remedy. The appellate court found that the undisputed facts demonstrated that the agreement entered into between the employee and employer to choose a facility by mutual consent was so indefinite and vague as to be unenforceable. The agreement was an agreement to negotiate in the future as to the selection of actual facility and was unenforceable. The employee's reference in the brief to the &quot;annual&quot; distribution or payment of a minimum of $50,000 was not supported by the undisputed provisions of the contract as the language was just too vague to ascertain its meaning. A cause of action under the doctrine of promissory estoppel could not be sustained. The application of the doctrine of elision was inappropriate but harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees, two public safety officers, sued defendant employers, a housing authority and the chief of its safety department, asserting retaliatory discharge claims under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-1-304 (2008) and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-301(2005), as well as defamation and interference with their contracts of employment. The Circuit Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee, granted summary judgment for the employers, and the employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that there was no evidence, for purposes of the claim under the Whistleblower Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-1-304 (2008), that either employee was asked or required to participate in or remain silent about any illegal activity. The reviewing court held that the statute did not require such evidence. Rather, it was sufficient if the employees had reasonable cause to believe that illegal conduct had occurred or would occur and reported it in good faith. At a minimum, there was a factual dispute as to whether the employees had a reasonable basis to believe that the employer's policy, as applied, was racial profiling. Summary judgment was nevertheless appropriate as to one employee because the facts showed that he was suspended over the employer's cell phone policy and therefore that retaliation was not the sole cause. As to the retaliation claim under &sect; 4-21-301, the authority failed to negate that the terminations were in retaliation for having opposed discriminatory practices, including illegal arrests based on racial profiling, warrantless searches, and illegal seizures of the mostly African-American residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to one officer's whistleblower claim but affirmed summary judgment as to the other officer's claim under that statute; vacated the grant of summary judgment as to both officers' claims under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-301; vacated the grant of summary judgment as to the claim for inducement of breach of contract; and affirmed summary judgment on the claim of defamation.</SPAN></P>

The owners argued that the trial court erred in determining that eminent domain was being exercised for a public use. The owners argued that their failure to question the right to take within five days of service of the petition was the result of excusable neglect and that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant them an extension of time within which to question the right to take. The appellate court found that while the trial court noted that the owners had not complied with the requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-17-803, the trial court held a hearing on Metro's right to take and determined that Metro had acted lawfully in condemning the easement. The owners had the opportunity to cross-examine Metro's witnesses and to put on their own witnesses. The easement at issue was for a public use. The proposed sewer line would become Metro's property, thereby expanding its sewer infrastructure and providing sewer service to a group of Metro residents. Metro's decision to take the easement across the owners' property was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, upheld the constitutionality of the Tennessee Sexual Offender and Violent Sexual Offender Registration, Verification, and Tracking Act of 2004 as amended by Public Law 2007-465 (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-39-202 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Plaintiff offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender sought to challenge the 2004 Act based upon the procedural and substantive due process and equal protection provisions found in Article 1, &sect; 8 and Article 11, &sect; 8 of the Tennessee Constitution. The appellate court noted that there was nothing in the record to indicate that he raised the issue of equal protection in the court below and it could not be considered as an issue on appeal. The appellate court found that the offender made no allegation that a fundamental right had been violated, nor did the trial court in its final judgment make a reference that a fundamental right had been called into question. The trial court did not err when it found that the Act had a reasonable relation to the stated purpose of legislation, to protect the public from the danger associated with sexual offenders, and it was not error for it to decline to expand the due process protection under federal law. Tennessee was no more or less attractive than any other state for sex offenders seeking a place to reside in total anonymity. The reasoning was applicable to the current Act as amended in 2007. The offender did not show how the Act impeded his right to travel among the states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Metro argued that a United States Supreme Court case abrogated the appellate court's previous ruling and should have been applied on remand. The appellate court noted that the trial court refused to consider the impact of the Supreme Court's decision because it was bound by the appellate court's instructions on remand and because it had previously specified the sole remaining issue for trial in its March 26, 2007 pretrial order. The appellate court's ruling in a prior case established the law of the case. The trial court did not err when it declined to modify the appellate court's instructions on remand. When the appellate court affirmed summary judgment and the dismissal of a prior appeal, the haulers' claim for a refund of any tipping fees previously paid to Metro was extinguished. The haulers were barred from asserting a second claim for a refund due to the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Their appropriate remedy was to file a petition for rehearing pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 39(a), or file an application with the Supreme Court of Tennessee for permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, homeowners, sought review of the decision of the Chancery Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, a county building commissioner (commissioner), in an action involving the homeowners' rental of their home to vacationers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the homeowner moved from their residence, they began renting it to vacationers. The commissioner instructed them to cease and desist renting their house for commercial purposes and after the homeowners refused, litigation ensued. The trial court granted the commissioner's motion for summary judgment, finding that the homeowners' use of their house for commercial purposes violated the applicable zoning regulations. The appellate court reversed, finding that the zoning regulations were unconstitutionally vague as applied to the homeowners. The trial court's judgment was, therefore, reversed and the case was dismissed. The appellate court excluded the option that tourist homes were completely prohibited. Since the county intended to allow tourist homes, the regulations were required to provide as least one zone where they were allowed because a complete failure to mention tourist homes resulted in a total prohibition. Unfortunately, the regulations simply did not specify where a tourist home could be located. Thus, the homeowners were left with no alternative but to try and &quot;guess&quot; what the drafters of the regulations intended to do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and dismissed the case. The case was remanded to the trial court solely for collection of costs below; costs on appeal, as well as those at the trial level, were taxed to the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that under the Act, the judgment of a sister state was entitled to full faith and credit. The parties also agreed that if Massachusetts lacked personal jurisdiction over the general partners, then the Massachusetts judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit and could not be enforced in Tennessee. The appellate court found that Massachusetts had personal jurisdiction over the general partners, who were part of an ongoing continuous business entity with Massachusetts participants that lasted for years. Reports were made on an ongoing basis with the Massachusetts limited partners together with other communications. The parties owned property together. The lawsuit was specifically related to those contacts with the Massachusetts entities that occurred in Massachusetts. The trial court did not err in denying the general partners' objections to domestication of the Massachusetts judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance creating the city court pursuant to its power under Private Chapter No. 167 (House Bill No. 3289) of the Private Acts of 2002. When it sought to limit the judge's jurisdiction and salary, the judge sought to prevent the city from doing such. On appeal, the court determined that Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 established that the Tennessee General Assembly was authorized to vest judicial power in the courts by ordaining and establishing them. This power involved fundamental principles of our system of governance, including the separation of powers doctrine. The Tennessee General Assembly's constitutional authority to vest judicial power in a lower court could not be delegated to a municipality, but had to be exercised directly by its legislation. Since the city obtained only the power the Tennessee Legislature could delegate, it could exercise no power that the Tennessee Legislature was unable to confer. Accordingly, the city court was not validly created.</SPAN></P>

In fact, the claimant's original petition stated that after the file review took place and he received notice that his inclusion on the indicated perpetrator list was being upheld, he filed his petition as an appeal directly from this finding.

There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court found that the owner willfully attempted to circumvent the requirements of the injunction order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court terminated the parental rights of the mother to her daughter. The trial court found that the grounds had been proven to terminate the mother's parental rights pursuant to T.C.A. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(8). More specifically, the trial court found that the mother was mentally incompetent to care for the child, and that her mental impairment was likely to remain making it unlikely that she would be able to care for the child in the near future. The trial court also found clear and convincing evidence that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interest. The appellate court affirmed. There were several procedural protections in place to assure that a mentally incompetent parent was afforded due process and the mother was afforded all of those protections. The child's guardian ad litem was required to prove grounds for termination under the clear and convincing evidentiary standard and the mother was appointed both an attorney and a guardian ad litem to protect her interests. Additionally, even with treatment, the mother's mental condition had improved very little and it was not safe for the child to be returned to her care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business argued that it had a legal, vested right to conduct its business in the area prior to annexation by the city. It argued that the city had to provide compensation for &quot;taking&quot; its customers and contracts, and for preventing the business from providing its services to residential customers. The appellate court noted that because the business sought compensation for a governmental &quot;taking&quot; although the city had instituted no eminent domain proceedings, the action was classified as one for inverse condemnation. The appellate court found that prior case law did not allow just compensation for any taken intangible &quot;property&quot; rights. Tennessee Code Annotated section 6-51-112(a) required that compensation be paid to electric cooperatives whose property and service rights were &quot;taken&quot; through annexation; however, Tennessee's statutes afford no similar protection to displaced garbage collectors. The appellate court found no support for the business' contention that the city's appropriation of garbage collection services for the area residences constituted a taking, such that just compensation was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee great-grandmother of the child obtained temporary custody of the child in 2001. In 2006, the great-grandmother filed suit seeking to terminate the parental rights of appellant father. The Chancery Court for Bradley County (Tennessee) found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) was constitutional and terminated the father's parental rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's parental rights were properly terminated under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) because he committed a crime and was confined to a correctional facility for 10 or more years and the child was under eight years old when the sentence was imposed. In addition, it was unknown when the father would be released from prison and then how long after his release before he would be able to care for the child, assuming he ever got to that point. Also, although the father maintained some contact with the child, 10 visits over the course of several years could not be described as regular. Furthermore, the child was doing exceedingly well in the care of her great-grandmother and a change of caretakers could indeed have a negative impact on the child's life. Additionally, the great-grandmother's home was a healthy and safe home for the child, and she had a very active role in the child's life. Thus, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(i) (Supp. 2008), the chancery court did not err when it found that the great-grandmother proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the chancery court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Polk County, Tennessee, granted appellee Polk County's motion to alter or amend and motion to dismiss on appellant whitewater rafting operator's suit seeking a refund of privilege taxes paid under protest for the 2001 Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-707 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-901. The operators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the question was the trial court erred in granting the county's motion to alter or amend and therefore, its motion to dismiss, upon grounds that the operator was without standing to assert the claims set forth in its complaint, and as a result, the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court found that the operator did have judicial standing as a consequence of specific legislative mandate. The remedy under &sect; 67-1-707 provided an unacceptable remedy for a taxpayer whose taxes were tainted with the illegality of wrongful assessments or any form of invalidity which may not be processed on an administrative basis. The operator was subrogated to whatever remedy the consumer taxpayer would have. Under the Maritime Transportation Security Act, 33 U.S.C.S. 5(b), there was a conflict between the county's local privilege tax and the statute, which prohibited the levying and collection of a tax from any vessel or water craft operating on any navigable waters subject to the authority of the United States or from its passengers or crew. The conflict was irreconcilable. Any refunds of monies belonged tot he consumers, not the operator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's summary judgment in favor of the operator was affirmed, and the trial court's orders granting the county's motion to alter or amend such summary judgment and motion to dismiss were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, upheld a decision by appellee Tennessee Motor Vehicle Commission (Commission) forbidding appellant vehicle manufacturer from approving a proposed relocation of appellant car dealer to Mt. Juliet from Nashville, and denying the dealer a license for the new location. The manufacturer and dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer and dealer argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-17-114(c)(20) (Supp. 2007) did not apply to the relocation of an existing dealership and that the Commission erroneously assigned the burden of proof to them, rather than to appellee competitor. The appellate court noted that the pertinent question was not how many franchised dealers there were, in total, but rather how many franchised dealers were in the relevant marketing area. Dealer relocations were unquestionably regulated by the statutory scheme of which &sect; 55-17-114(c)(20) was a part. A separate license was required for each location and franchise, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-17-110 (Supp. 2007). The Commission acted within its authority in subjecting the manufacturer and dealer to a hearing on their proposed relocation under the auspices of &sect; 55-17-114(c)(20). The administrative law judge did not abuse the discretion granted by Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1360-4-1-.02(7) where the manufacturer and dealer sought to change the present state of affairs when they proposed to relocate the dealer. The Commission followed the statutory principles, as well as the guidelines laid down by the Tennessee Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the case, but stated that plaintiffs' constitutional arguments would be best addressed by the appellate courts. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee held that Calaway's interpretation of &sect; 29-26-116(a) effectively overturned a body of law that plaintiffs had reasonably relied upon; the sudden reversal of precedents tolling the statute of repose during the period of minority violated plaintiffs' due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents were divorced.

On appeal, the court found that the testimony at trial preponderated in favor of a finding that the parents did not oppose visitation. The undisputed testimony at trial by the parents was that they did not oppose visitation. Such a conclusion was reinforced by the grandparents' testimony regarding the visitation that they had as well as their admission that they chose not to exercise visitation at other times. In order for &sect; 36-6-306 to have been implicated, visitation by the grandparents would have had to have been opposed by the parents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff-appellants, the state and county through relators, appealed from an order of the Chancery Court for Knox County (Tennessee), in favor of defendant-appellee, the county election commission, that it had no declaratory judgment authority to order new elections, that the claims seeking new elections were otherwise moot, that the validity of the charter was moot, and in the alternative, that the plaintiffs lacked standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted a home rule charter which included term limits for elected office holders. The Tennessee Attorney General (AG) opined that the term-limit provisions were unconstitutional, and the county's officials proceeded on the assumption that the term limits were ineffective. A court opinion cast doubt upon the AG opinion. The relators sued, seeking a declaratory judgment to enforce the term limits in the charter. The county commissioners, who stood to be disqualified if the charter and thus the term limits were to be ruled valid, sought to have the charter declared invalid. The trial court had properly found the issue of the validity of the county charter to be moot. Eight possibly term-limited county commissioners and a sheriff, county clerk, register of deeds, and trustee were reelected in 2006. The relators attempted to amend the complaint and to negate those election results, an issue which had also already been settled by other litigation.  The validity of the 2006 election was at least moot with regard to the issues that are actually discussed in the record. Amendment of the relators' complaint would also have been futile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Costs on appeal were taxed to the relators, and the case was remanded to the trial court for collection of costs assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee planning commission sought civil penalties and injunctive relief against appellant mobile home park alleged to be in violation of a private act regulating mobile home parks in the county.

The mobile home park appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In November 1997, two brothers quit claimed their interest in the subject property to an owner who intended to establish a mobile home park. In July 1997, the planning commission circulated to its members a proposed private act to regulate mobile home parks. On May 11, 1998, the act took effect. Prior to this date, the owner had taken substantial steps to operate the mobile home park. He have even collected collecting rent for the mobile home park lots. The trial court erred in finding that the owner failed to carry his burden of proof to show the mobile home park was in operation before the act took effect. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee held that mobile home park was classified as a residential use; therefore, it was not subject to the grandfather protection of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208(b)(1). The trial court did not err by finding that the mobile home park was abandoned. For more than one year, the property deteriorated to the point where there was no administrative control and people were living there without paying any rent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state brought suit against appellee county and appellee city before a chancery court seeking reimbursement for costs associated with the mental health evaluations of juveniles. The chancery court ordered the state to seek relief from the Juvenile Court for Knox County, Tennessee. The juvenile court issued separate orders. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three juveniles were charged with offenses that would have been felonies if the juveniles had been adults. The other eight juveniles were charged with misdemeanors. The county and the state disputed which governmental entity should pay for costs associated with the mental evaluations of the eleven juveniles. The state argued for the enforcement of a distinction between direct and incidental costs. Nevertheless, the state failed at the trial court level to make the statutory distinction it advanced on appeal. The juvenile court based its judgments in significant part on the notion an expense for the care of each child was an incidental cost, governed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-150(b). The appellate court had no way of knowing whether the amount charged to the state in the three felony cases was based entirely on cost of the examination. The appellate court concluded that the fairest course was to leave the trial court's determination undisturbed with respect to the three juveniles charged with felony offenses. With respect to a juvenile charged with a misdemeanor, there was no statutory authorization for charging the state with the costs. The county was responsible for the costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed with respect to orders requiring the county to pay costs in misdemeanor cases. The orders requiring the state to pay the costs of juveniles that were charged with felonies were also affirmed. The order requiring the state  to pay the costs associated with a juvenile who was charged with a misdemeanor was reversed. The matter was remanded to the trial court for enforcement of the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, granted respondent warden's motion to dismiss and awarded summary judgment to respondent Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Correction on petitioner inmate's declaratory judgment alleging Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 40-25-143 had been unconstitutionally retroactively applied to his inmate trust account to reimburse the State for costs arising from his prosecution. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that, despite its August 2006 order vacating the trial court's order dismissing the inmate's Rule 59 motion for lack of jurisdiction and remanding the matter to the trial court for adjudication of the motion, the trial court's September 2006 order merely reiterated its earlier order dismissing on the basis of lack of jurisdiction. Pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 4(e), the inmate filed a premature notice of appeal where he filed the notice after filing a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend but before the trial court had adjudicated that motion. Accordingly, the trial court retained jurisdiction over the inmate's timely-filed Rule 59 motion. Because the inmate had filed his notice of appeal, jurisdiction would vest in the appellate court when the trial court entered a final order adjudicating the motion on its merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated and remanded to the trial court with instructions to comply with the appellate court's order of August 30, 2006, and dispose of the motion on its merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee maternal grandmother filed a petition seeking visitation pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-6-306 and 36-6-307 (2001). The Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) granted the petition and awarded the grandmother 78 days of visitation annually. Appellant father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother provided housing and served as a primary caregiver for the child when the child and the mother moved to Tennessee. The mother died when the child was five years old. The grandmother resumed her role as a primary caregiver for the child. The relationship between the grandmother and the father began to decline as did the frequency of her contact with the child. The appellate court determined that the father waived his challenge to the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-306 because he failed to raise the issue in the trial court and the statute was not so obviously unconstitutional as to obviate the necessity for review by the trial court. The record fully supported the finding that irreparable harm would result to the child if the grandmother was denied visitation and there was no error in the determination that visitation was in the best interests of the child because, inter alia, the child resided in her home for 12 months or longer, she served as a primary caregiver for a substantial and critical period of the child's life, and she remained the child's only significant connection to his deceased mother. However, the visitation schedule required remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed in part the trial court's judgment as to a portion of the visitation schedule and the injunctions against non-parties, affirmed the judgment as to the remaining issues, and assessed the costs of appeal against the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee clerk sought a declaration of his rights under Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 8-24-102 as amended in 2001, asserting that the 2001 amendments repealed by implication 2000 Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the County contended the trial court erred in ruling that the general law as opposed to the private act was applicable to the issue of which salary act should have been used to calculate the clerk's salary in his capacity as the county juvenile court clerk. In light of the general assembly's presumed knowledge of the provisions of the general statute when it enacted 2000 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 142, and in light of its presumed awareness of the private act when it amended the general provisions of section 8-24-102 in 2001, coupled with the absence of any language in the 2001 amendments to Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 8-24-102 repealing this or any similar private act, the appellate court held that the 2001 amendments to Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 8-24-102 did not repeal 2000 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 142 by implication. Additionally, the private act was not blatantly unconstitutional on its face, and the issue of whether it was unconstitutional under Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 8-24-102 was not properly raised in the trial court where the Attorney General was not served with notice of this litigation. As such, the trial court erred in ruling in favor of the clerk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a child's aunt and uncle and the prospective adoptive parents, appealed the judgment of the Juvenile Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) that dismissed their petition for termination of appellee father's parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued, inter alia, that the evidence clearly and convincingly established that the father abandoned the child. The court of appeals agreed. It was undisputed that the father did not visit or support the child during the four month period leading up to August 16, 2005, the date of the termination petition. The father had not seen the child since the mother left the father after Christmas of 2003, and the father never sent financial support or gifts to the child while he lived with the great aunt. However, the father argued that his failure to visit or support the child was not willful because the great aunt interfered with his visitation. However, the father did nothing to attempt to maintain even minimal contact with the child through a card, letter, or gift. The father testified that the great aunt let him speak to the child twice in February of 2004, yet the father did not attempt to call the child again after that month. Therefore, the trial court erred by failing to terminate the father's parental rights on the ground of abandonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was denied parole by appellee Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole and lost his administrative appeal. The court clerk returned his petition for writ of certiorari because he owed court costs from previous litigation. The court costs were paid, and the inmate was allowed to file his petition. The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, subsequently dismissed the petition as not being timely filed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended the 60-day statute of limitations under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-9-102 was tolled when he submitted the complaint until the clerk's office notified him that his prior court costs were paid; Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-812 was unconstitutional; and the trial court erred in assessing court costs against him. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that when the petition was resubmitted and filed, the mandatory 60-day filing period had expired, and the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case; the limitations statute made no provision for tolling. Since the inmate did not raise the constitutionality of &sect; 41-21-812 issue at trial and it was not unconstitutional on its face, the appellate court would not entertain the issue on appeal. As the Board was the prevailing party and no extraordinary circumstances warranting review appeared in the record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing court costs against the inmate under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-12-119.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city council and a city, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which, on remand, found that the city was in willful contempt of a prior order relating to a zoning application filed appellee landowners and assessed daily damages accruing from the date of the prior order until there was compliance with the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sought to change the zoning on a parcel of land from agricultural to commercial. After several procedural steps in the case, the trial court found that willful contempt existed due to the council's failure to comply with a prior order. Daily damages were assessed. This appeal followed. In vacating, the appellate court rejected the assertion that there could have been no finding of contempt; a prior order of the trial court was not void based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Even though zoning ordinances were legislative acts, the trial court did have authority over such. The trial court properly treated the landowners' action as one for a declaratory judgment and proceeded accordingly. Next, the appellate court had jurisdiction to review the contempt finding, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-4-108(b) (1994). Even if the trial court's order regarding the new hearing might have been improper, disobeying such was not the proper decision. The council improperly entertained new evidence at the hearing. However, the trial court's use of a coercive fine was improper because it was awarded retroactively prior to the finding of contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was vacated. The case was remanded to the council for a new hearing. The hearing was ordered to follow the proper procedure; it should have provided a proper notice and a hearing, and it should have considered current information.</SPAN></P>

It argued that the Act violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 3 of the Tennessee Constitution. The appellate court found that the corporation failed to fulfill a condition precedent to being eligible for either exemption under the Act. It never submitted the form prescribed by the secretary of state, and it never provided the statutorily mandated information. The Act did not impose a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint as it did not envision a grant or denial of a license or a permit, only registration. The State did not have the discretion to deny registration. The corporation failed to support its contention that the Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The corporation failed to establish that it had standing for a Commerce Clause claim. The Act did not violate Article I, Section 3 of the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in Crockett County, Tennessee; however, they resided in Dyer County, Tennessee, at the time of the divorce. The mother then moved to Kentucky. The parties first shared custody of their minor child; however, the father was later designated the primary residential parent. The father later sought to enforce a child support order entered in Crockett County. The mother's request to transfer the case to Dyer County was denied, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court held that the father's constitutional arguments were not preserved for review because he did not raise them before the trial court. The father did not have permission to raise such challenges in this interlocutory appeal under Rule 9 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Next, Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 36-5-3003 (2005) did not limit standing to request a transfer to the custodial parent or to residents of Tennessee. Moreover, a transfer was mandatory here because the requirements of Tennessee Code Annotated &sect; 36-5-3003(b) (2005) were met. Finally, there was no limitation on transfers for cases where the original order was entered, despite a waiver of venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, upheld appellee Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance's (State) contention that appellant tax service's &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; (POM) program was a contract of insurance under T.C.A. &sect; 56-7-101 as it was written, and, therefore, the tax service was subject to various penalties under that statute because it was not licensed to sell insurance. The tax service appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the threshold question for it to answer was whether Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-7-101(a) was devoid of ambiguity. It found that the statute did not specify what types of interest were &quot;insurable,&quot; which was critical in determining what constituted &quot;insurance.&quot; In light of the circular reference to &quot;insurance&quot; and &quot;insurable interest,&quot; the statute implicitly incorporated some commonsense notion of what sort of contract could constitute insurance, and therefore it could not have been the legislature's intent to include such contracts as simple product warranties offered by a retailer, which did not pass such a commonsense test. The question was whether the contract, as a whole, was primarily a service guarantee or a promise of indemnity. The POM program fell on the &quot;service&quot; side of the service-indemnity test not because the service provided its customers with the &quot;service&quot; of legal representation if they were audited, but the program was that of a tax-preparation service with an added guarantee. An error by the tax service did not create an insurable &quot;loss,&quot; but simply an unfulfilled expectation.</SPAN></P>

Despite the language in T.C.A. &sect; 29-21-103 (2000) referencing chancellors, they had no authority to inquire into the restraint of prisoners or the validity of criminal convictions. The language of the statute referencing chancellors merely referred to restraints not criminally imposed or sanctioned. The requirement that a habeas corpus petition should have been made to the most convenient court or judge had to be read in conjunction with the limitation on the chancery court's jurisdiction. The prisoner should have sought relief from the most convenient court authorized to grant such. Thus, the petition was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father sought a reduction in his child support obligation. Because the father had not established a significant variance of at least 15 percent under Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1240-2-4-.05(2)(a), the trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed on appeal. The father was required to show at least a 15 percent difference in his gross income from the time that child support was originally ordered until the time that he filed his modification motion. The court found no error in the trial court's decision to decline to use a case law formula to reverse engineer the father's gross income at the time of the divorce petition for purposes of determining whether a significant variance had been established. There being no transcript or statement of the evidence, for purposes of Rule 24 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court presumed that the trial court was correct in including a certain amount in the father's 2004 gross income for comparison purposes. Considering the mother's income and the outcome of the appeal, the court remanded for a determination of attorney fees under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-103(c) for this appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Gibson County (Tennessee) terminating his parental rights to his child on the ground that he abandoned the child under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was removed from her mother's home when she was seven months old and placed in her great-aunt's custody. At the time, the father's whereabouts were unknown and he subsequently began serving a 56-month sentence in federal prison. When the child turned five, her great-aunt petitioned to terminate the father's parental rights and to adopt her. On appeal of the trial court's decision granting the petition, the court held that the proof clearly and convincingly established that the father abandoned the child because: (1) he only engaged in token visits with the child, as he only visited her twice in the four months before he went to prison; (2) he did not seek visitation through the trial court; (3) he testified that he had not been a good father and that the child did not know him; (4) the father admitted that he personally had not given the child any birthday or Christmas gifts prior to his incarceration; and (5) the child's great-aunt did not vigorously resist the father's to visit the child, but rather the father willfully failed to visit. Because the child's great-aunt took custody of her the Department of Children's Services was not required to attempt reunification.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the petition was properly dismissed because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court found no error in the Board's procedure because there was no basis to the inmate's argument that the full panel should conduct the hearing, given section 40-28-105(d)(2), and the inmate admitted that all board members declined him for parole release.

The court further held that while Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and his former wife, now deceased, were divorced in 1977. Custody of the child was awarded to her maternal grandparents. According to the 1978 custody order, the father's whereabouts were then unknown. The child support battle began in 1983 when the father apparently was located and the grandparents petitioned for child support. In 1983, the trial court awarded the grandparents retroactive and prospective child support. The trial court found the father in contempt for failure to pay the child support, and later dismissed the order of contempt and granted the father a new trial. In 1998, a settlement agreement was finally reached and judgment in the amount of $ 8,711.31 was entered for child support arrearages through June 14, 1990, when the child was emancipated by marriage at sixteen years of age. The father did not pay the arrearages as agreed and in 2003 the State filed its petition to enforce and set payments. The appellate court ruled that it could find no grounds upon which the agreed settlement should not be enforced. Since 1983 the father had refused to pay his child support obligation an, since 1999, had evaded the arrearages settlement to which he agreed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1982, the inmate entered a guilty plea to robbery by use of a deadly weapon and murder during the perpetration of a robbery. Parole was denied for a second time in 2005, and the inmate filed a petition for a writ of certiorari after an administrative appeal was unsuccessful. A motion to dismiss the case was granted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the inmate's argument that the use of the current rules and statutes relating to parole violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 10. An amendment to Tenn. Dep't Corr. Pol'y No. 501.30 in 1992 regarding future hearing dates did not increase the original sentence and inflict greater punishment. Next, because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-503 (2006) did not affect a parole eligibility date or the denial of parole, but merely enumerated one reason that a parole board could have elected to deny parole, it was not an ex post facto violation either. Finally, the inmate merely offered conclusory references in attacking the board's decision; he did not show any procedural irregularities or establish that it acted illegally, fraudulently, or arbitrarily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer was arrested for possession of cocaine. The Tennessee Department of Revenue assessed taxes, a penalty, and interest against the taxpayer under Tennessee's Drug Tax, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2801 et seq. The taxpayer filed suit against defendant Commissioner of Revenue, charging that the Drug Tax was unconstitutional. The Chancery Court for Loudon County, Tennessee, entered judgment for the taxpayer. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Drug Tax was purportedly an excise upon a particular privilege, assessed according to the quantity of substance possessed in enjoyment of such privilege. The power to tax privileges was not subject to any constitutional limitation except that the tax levied must not be arbitrary, capricious, or wholly unreasonable. The Drug Tax levied a tax on unauthorized substances and specifically provided that the tax did not apply to a substance in the possession of a dealer who was authorized by law to possess the substance, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2804(a). Furthermore, the tax applied only to persons in unauthorized possession of substances which the legislature declared to be illegal. Because it sought to levy a tax on the privilege to engage in an activity that the legislature previously declared to be a crime, not a privilege, the court found that the Drug Tax was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable, and therefore, invalid under the Constitution of Tennessee. The legislature's enactment of the Drug Tax was not supported by the rationale justifying the enactment of a privilege tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the wife, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which found in favor of defendant, the husband, and found that the marriage was invalid because her service of process on her second husband during her second divorce had been insufficient. The circuit court also distributed property and made an alimony award to the wife during the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed for divorce from her husband and the husband collaterally attacked the validity of the wife's previous divorce from her second husband. The trial court found that the wife's efforts at service of process on her second husband during her second divorce had been insufficient, and ruled that any subsequent marriage was therefore invalid. The trial court also found that a bank account held jointly by the parties was the sole property of the husband, and it awarded each party a one-half interest in real property located in Tennessee. The appellate court reversed in part, stating that the trial court's allowance of a collateral attack by the husband on the issue of jurisdiction was in contravention of the law as his basis for such attack was, in part, parole proof, and not a facially void decree. The trial court erred in finding that the marriage was void ab initio and erred in applying the Falk standards for property division since the marriage was valid and not void from its inception. The award of alimony, however, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the trial court erred by permitting the husband to collaterally attack the prior divorce decree, reversed the judgment as to the division of property, affirmed the award of alimony, and remanded for further proceedings as to the parties' respective claims for divorce and for further proceedings as to their claims for the distribution of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter arose from a dispute between plaintiff bank and defendant bank regarding plaintiff's liability for discretionary costs after voluntarily dismissing the complaint it had filed against defendant in the Chancery Court for Williamson County, Tennessee. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the entry of a voluntary dismissal, defendant, invoking Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.04 and 54.04, requested the trial court to award its attorney's fees and court reporter expenses as discretionary costs. On appeal, plaintiff took issue with the award of discretionary costs and requested a declaration that defendant violated Tenn. R. Civ. P. 11 by requesting these costs. The trial court did err by awarding defendant its attorney's fees as discretionary costs, but the trial did not abuse its discretion in awarding court reporter expenses. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to award costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.04 because plaintiff did not commence its subsequent action in the chancery court, but it instead commenced the action in the federal court. Even if the appellate court assumed, arguendo, that Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.04 allowed trial courts to award attorney's fees following the voluntary dismissal of a case as part of the costs of the action previously dismissed, the appellate court would still find the trial court erred by awarding attorney's fees in this case. The appellate court also declined to consider whether defendant's conduct violated Tenn. R. Civ. P. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the portion of the order with respect to fees, and it remanded the case to the trial court with directions to reduce the judgment and for whatever further proceedings consistent with the rule as was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the judgment of the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, granting summary judgment in favor of appellee, the Tennessee Department of Correction (TDOC), dismissing the inmate's declaratory judgment suit asserting that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-123 violated his constitutional rights of due process and constituted double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1989, the inmate was convicted of various drug-related offenses, and was sentenced to a 42 years of imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 30 percent of that sentence. The inmate was assigned to a county work camp, where he was assigned a position as park worker and was allowed to work in the community. In 1992, while imprisoned at the county work camp, the inmate was convicted of possession of contraband, a felony. Based on this conviction and pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-123(b)(1), the inmate lost his parole eligibility date. The appellate court ruled that the inmate's constitutional rights were not violated. Because Tennessee did not recognize a constitutional right to early release, the inmate could not show that he had suffered a deprivation of a liberty interest or that he was entitled to any procedural due process in the TDOC's revocation of his release eligibility date. Also, the inmate failed to provide any evidence or cite any authorities in support of his contention that his equal protection rights were violated in any way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county fire department terminated appellant firefighter's employment for a conceded violation of the county residency requirement set forth in Shelby County, Tenn., Charter &sect; 5.10. The county civil service merit board modified the department's sanction from termination to suspension without pay. On appeal, the Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) reinstated the department's termination. The firefighter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter argued that the charter did not mandate termination; that, even if it did, he had moved back to Shelby County at the time of his termination and should not have been discharged; and that, alternatively, he was entitled to a remand to advance an equal protection argument because he was unfairly prevented from doing so in the lower court. The court of appeals agreed with the trial court that &sect; 5.10 (C) was &quot;clear in and of itself&quot; and held that the charter provision mandated only one sanction for the violation. Because the charter residency requirement mandated the termination of employment when an individual had violated it, the merit board exceeded its authority when, in contravention of that provision, it modified the firefighter's sanction from termination to suspension without pay. There was no dispute that the firefighter resided in another county at the time the department filed charges against him. Given that fact, his subsequent attempt to cure the violation was ineffectual. Moreover, the firefighter had waived the equal protection issue by failing to raise it in the lower court; the court of appeals therefore denied his request for a remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The case was remanded. Costs of the appeal were taxed to the firefighter and his surety, for which execution could issue if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the 1998 enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-28-115(h)(2) and 40-35-501(i)(2) and their application to him constituted a violation of several vested rights. The appellate court found that the statutes did not have the effect of delaying the inmate's first parole eligibility hearing. The inmate's initial release eligibility date was in 1997, and pursuant to that eligibility, he was afforded a parole hearing on June 24, 1997. The parole board denied him parole at that time. The inmate's assertion that he acquired a liberty interest in being paroled was without merit. The amendment to the statutes did not constitute an illegal pronouncement of guilt by the legislature. The inmate was challenging the validity of the statute, not the validity of the policy. The legislature's defining of the factors the Board of Probation and Parole had to consider in making a decision about whether to afford an inmate a parole hearing did not encroach upon the Board or the executive branch. The amendment to the statutes did not constitute a sentence enhancement scheme because no time was added to the inmate's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, dismissed appellant carrier's constitutional challenges to portions of Tennessee's tax system. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the basis that the carrier failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The carrier appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State argued that the carrier's action against the State could not be maintained because the carrier failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and a petition for declaratory judgment could not be maintained against the State. The appellate court found that the carrier was seeking a declaratory judgment that the present tax scheme was unconstitutional. It was permissible for the carrier to commence and maintain the declaratory judgment action. The carrier's issues concerned legal challenges to the statutory scheme. Where a party's complaint raised primarily questions of law, the court was the appropriate body to adjudicate the issues, and, therefore, the complaining party was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies. The carrier's facial challenge to the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-501(9)(B)(iii) could not be determined by an administrative tribunal in an administrative proceeding. Requiring that the carrier return to the State Board of Equalization would not give the Board an opportunity to correct an error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, granted judgment in favor of appellee Tennessee Department of Human Services (DHS) by entering a permanent injunction against appellant church preventing it from operating its Bible School unless or until it obtained a license. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that because the church was providing &quot;child care,&quot; in the sense that its staff supervised, protected, and met basic needs, for at least 13 children for more than 3 hours per day, the church's Bible School met the definition of a &quot;child care center&quot; under Tennessee's child care licensing laws. The concerns expressed by the church did not demonstrate that it had suffered an injury in factor or that it faced immediate injury from enforcement of the day care licensing regulations. The child care licensing laws clearly regulated conduct, not one's beliefs. Any finding that the Bible School ministry was a religious activity in and of itself would not have exempted the church from the state licensing requirement. The licensing statute did not textually discriminate against religion or religious groups. There was no indication that DHS was routinely making subjective assessments of a program's justification for providing child care that would present the opportunity for religious discrimination. The licensing law need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if it had the incidental effect of burdening the church's religious practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was currently incarcerated and serving a seventy-three year prison sentence for offenses committed in 1985. The petitioner was formally advised of the Board's decision on August 27, 2003. The petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, and on September 24, 2003, the trial court informed the petitioner that his petition for writ of certiorari had not been filed and could not be filed until all outstanding court costs had been paid. The petitioner subsequently paid the outstanding fees, and in January 2005 he refiled his petition for writ of certiorari. The appellate court ruled that the trial court properly dismissed the petition. The petition failed to comply with the requirements for filing a writ of certiorari under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-8-104(a) and 27-8-106 (2000). The petition was not verified and failed to state that it was the first application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After unsuccessfully appealing a parole denial administratively, appellant petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari claiming that appellee board of paroles improperly applied a version of the statute governing parole of sex offenders which was amended after he committed the crimes. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) determined there was no ex post facto violation and dismissed the petition. The petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner claimed that the version of the statute as it existed when he committed the crimes should have been applied and application of the statute as amended resulted in an ex post facto violation. The petitioner claimed that he was denied due process and that the board's application of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-116 violated the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. The issue was whether application of &sect; 40-28-116, as amended after the petitioner committed the crimes, was disadvantageous to him. The appellate court held that the petitioner had not demonstrated that application of the amended statute would in any way effectively postpone his initial release date. Moreover, his claim that application of the amended statute would postpone his release date was nothing more than pure speculation. The amended statute was less restrictive than the statute in effect at the time the petitioner committed the aggravated rape in 1981. Therefore, there was no impermissible ex post facto violation. The petitioner's due process claim was equally without merit. There was ample material evidence to support the board's findings and the trial court properly dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court for collection of the costs below. Costs on appeal were taxed to the petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit corporation members sued defendant corporate officer, seeking injunctive relief prohibiting the officer from acting in his former capacity. The Chancery Court for Maury County (Tennessee) found that the members were not properly before the court because of defects in the initial complaint, allowed them to intervene, and awarded them attorneys' fees under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 79-11-193 (2005). The officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the members had met the demand requirement of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 79-11-193 (2005) because although their initial complaint contained no allegations of a demand upon the corporation, their subsequent motion to intervene was properly granted under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 24.02 (2006) and they were properly allowed to file an amended complaint. Moreover, based on the officer's failure to include a transcript of evidence, the appellate court presumed that the evidence presented at multiple hearings supported the trial court's finding that the corporation's executive council refused to appropriately respond to the members' objections before and after the litigation was instituted. Thus, the trial court properly awarded the members attorneys' fees. The officer also failed to provide any authority for his argument that the members lacked standing to bring an action on behalf of the corporation based upon the corporate bylaws. That argument appeared to be founded upon the members' alleged failure to satisfy the Mississippi statute, an argument the appellate court had already rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, concluded that appellee physician received adequate notice of the purpose of the request for medical records by appellant Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners (Board) and determined that Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court determined that the Board and the Division of Health Related Boards (Division) in the Tennessee Department of Health (Department) had concurrent authority to enforce compliance with the laws regulating the practice of medicine in Tennessee in order to prevent unlawful practices.

Physicians who complied with the Division's or Board's request for patient records did not violate the implied covenant of confidentiality because they were required to honor a proper request for patient records. The procedure mandated by Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer sued the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of Tennessee, challenging the decision to assess the taxpayer excise taxes predicated on a transfer of an apartment complex to the mortgage holder. The Chancery Court for Knox County (Tennessee) held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2006(b)(2)(C) permitted the taxpayer to increase its depreciated basis, resulting in no excise taxes being due. The Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the taxpayer was required to utilize its federal basis in the property in determining if it was obligated to pay state excise taxes as a result of the &quot;sale&quot; of the property. The trial court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2006(b)(2)(C) was not limited to situations where there was a legislatively-mandated &quot;decoupling&quot; of the net earnings tax basis for excise tax purposes from federal taxable income. This case was an example of one of the different ways a taxpayer could have a higher basis in property for purposes of the state excise tax laws versus federal income tax law. While the taxpayer claimed the pre-1999 depreciation deductions and its federal income tax basis was lower, it also received a clear benefit from those deductions via a reduction in its ordinary income. If the taxpayer was unable to utilize a higher basis, it received no corresponding benefit on the state side from the lowered basis. The amount of the federal basis was $ 3,913,882. The difference between that basis and the state basis was the amount of the pre-1999 depreciation deductions, $ 6,524,612. When that amount was taken into consideration, there was no income from the transaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and for collection of costs. Costs on appeal were assessed to the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenured teacher, whose position was abolished due to a system wide reduction in force, filed an action due to appellee school district's failure to afford her preferential consideration for reemployment pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-5-511(b)(3) of the Teacher Tenure Act. The Chancery Court for Williamson County (Tennessee) summarily dismissed the teacher's claim. The teacher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court concluded that, as a matter of law, the teacher was not entitled to preferential consideration for teaching positions that were to start after July 1, 2002, because her tenure expired due to the fact she was 65 years of age. The appellate court concluded that the teacher's right to preferential consideration vested prior to July 1, 2002, which afforded her the right to be placed and to remain on the preferred list for up to two years, until she refused a bona fide offer of reemployment for a comparable position or accepted a position, which she had not done. Moreover, since the board of education did not consider the competence or qualifications of the teacher to hold a teaching position after the reduction in force announcement, as it was statutorily entitled to do pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-5-511(b)(3), it waived the right to contend that the teacher was unqualified, incompatible, or unsuitable to hold one of the available teaching positions for which she interviewed. The appellate court therefore concluded that the teacher was entitled to reemployment for the 2002-03 school year and that she was wrongfully denied reemployment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the chancery court was vacated. The case was remanded for entry of an order granting the teacher's motion for summary judgment and determination of the compensation that the teacher was entitled to receive for the 2002-03 school year. Costs of the appeal were assessed against the school district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician asserted that the statutory procedure for gaining access to medical records amounted to an unreasonable search and seizure because it failed to provide him with pre-enforcement judicial review of the reasonableness of the Board's request. He also claimed that the statute's notice provisions violated due process. Both the physician and the Board filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court held that the physician received adequate notice of the purpose of the request for medical records. It also determined that &sect; 63-1-117(a)(3), the portion of the statute authorizing disciplinary sanctions against physicians who willfully failed to produce requested records, was unconstitutional and awarded the physician attorney's fees. The Board appealed. The appellate court agreed that the physician received adequate notice of the reasons for the request for medical records. However, physicians in Tennessee had no reasonable expectation that they could shield their patients' records from the Board's regulatory oversight and the Board could discipline physicians who willfully refused to comply with lawful requests for patient records that comply with &sect; 63-1-117.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment concluding that the physician received adequate notice of the purpose of the request for medical records was affirmed.

The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the complaint for declaratory judgment. Costs were taxed to the physician.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statute was constitutional. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was the result of his unlawful sexual relationship with his 12-year-old stepdaughter. The father was convicted of two counts of attempted child rape and sentenced to serve 10 years in prison on each count, with the sentences to be served concurrently. When the child was about four years old, the foster parents filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights and to adopt the child. The foster parents alleged the ground set forth in &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) as the sole basis for terminating the father's parental rights. The statute provided for termination of a parent's rights where the parent was under a sentence of 10 or more years and the child was under eight years of age at the time the sentence was entered. The appellate court found that the statute was not blatantly or facially unconstitutional. The appellate court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) (2005) was not constitutionally deficient because of its failure to expressly require a separate finding that continuation of the parent-child relationship threatened the welfare of the child. Thus, the appellate court concluded that the statute was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

Appellants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal of the trial court's judgment denying appellants' motion, the court held that the trial court should have dismissed all of the former church members' claims because they were barred by the First Amendment's protection of purely religious matters from interference by secular courts. The freedom of churches to determine their own membership was such a fundamentally ecclesiastical matter that the court was prohibited from adjudicating disputes over membership or expulsion. The court held that it could not determine whether the reasons appellants gave for the members' expulsion were pretextual because to do so it would necessarily have had to inquire into the correction of the expulsion decision and whether it was consistent with the church's religious doctrine and internal policies, an inquiry the court could not make under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee put out signs during an election that opposed a clerk, an elected official.

The employee was informed that the signs could have been violative of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-19-142. The Board upheld the employee's later termination for disseminating these signs. He unsuccessfully sought review under a writ of certiorari, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-8-101 (2000). This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the press conference held by the employee was not the kind prohibited by Directive 1-8 of the Criminal Court's Clerk's Administrative Manual. However, he was not terminated for violating this, but for making and distributing the political signs. The argument that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-19-142 was unconstitutional was meritless because it was not blatantly overbroad. The failure to give proper notice was fatal to any other challenge to such.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' son was killed when the minivan he and his mother were riding in was struck by a pickup truck. The infant's head collided with the head of another occupant, whose seat fell backwards during the accident. On appeal of the trial court's judgment for the parents, the court held that the manufacturer waived its defense that the parents' complaint did not contain a valid ad damnum clause under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.08 because it failed to raise the challenge in its answer, instead waiting until four months after the trial concluded. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to support an award to the mother for negligent infliction of emotional distress because she failed to present any expert testimony supporting the claim. Such testimony was required because the mother's claim was a stand-alone claim, as it was for a purely mental injury; she sought no damages for physical injuries or property damage. Even though the trial court erred by instructing the jury on a post-sale duty to warn, as such a duty was not recognized in Tennessee, because the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the parents' remaining theories of recovery, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A divorce decree was entered in Kansas between the parties. The ex-wife attempted to enforce the Kansas decree in Tennessee with regard to the division of marital property and payment of child support. The ex-husband challenged the constitutionality of several Tennessee statutes, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-2001 et seq., Tennessee's Commission for Uniform Legislation, the UCCJA, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) and all legislation that proceeded from the National Conference of Commissioner on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL). The appellate court found that the ex-husband's due process rights were not violated because he was given the opportunity to be heard and was provided proper notice. The Kansas court properly exercised jurisdiction over the ex-husband. Many of the statutes that the ex-husband challenged did not apply to his case. The UIFSA was not vague because it clearly set forth the bases and procedure for establishing jurisdiction over a nonresident. The UIFSA did not violate equal protection because it treated all parents and children who were subject to child custody proceedings equally.</SPAN></P>

That was the only &quot;substantial evidence&quot; necessary to justify the trial court's determinate commitment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-137. No other justification or consideration was required. In addition, there was evidence that defendant blamed the events on the codefendant and the victim. There was also evidence that defendant showed little remorse for what happened. Thus, there was evidence suggesting that defendant was in need of extensive treatment and rehabilitation. The record did not support defendant's contentions challenging the propriety of the trial court's determinate commitment. The court of appeals also held that a determinate commitment was not more severe than an indefinite commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state occupational safety commission found appellant construction company in violation of 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1926.652, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation that prohibited employees from entering a large excavated trench that did not contain adequate protection to prevent the earthen walls from collapsing on employees. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) affirmed the decision. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that its foreman was the only one who entered the unprotected trench and he was not an &quot;employee&quot; as defined by 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1926.32(j) (2006). In the alternative, if a violation had occurred, it was not liable as the foreman's actions constituted employee misconduct. It was undisputed that the deep end of the trench was not properly shorn, sloped, or protected by a trench box as required by 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1926.652(b) or (c) (2006). The company argued that the definition of &quot;employee&quot; in 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1926.32(j) (2006) controlled, as it pertained specifically to the construction industry and was adopted by the commissioner. The appellate court held that although the foreman had supervisory duties, he supervised on behalf of the company and also engaged in the same physical labor as those he supervised, thereby putting him in the same classification as the company's other employees, only with additional supervisory responsibilities. As a consequence, the foreman fell within the definitions of &quot;employee&quot; under, inter alia, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-3-103. The court also found that the company provided scant evidence to support the affirmative defense of employee misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed and the matter was remanded with the costs of the appeal assessed against the construction company.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The deputy testified that she told defendant that she and the principle were going to search his truck and asked him to join them. The deputy informed defendant that the reason for the search was that another student had been found intoxicated and said that he had been in defendant's truck. While defendant argued that the deputy's request was tantamount to an order and that an ordinary student in defendant's situation would not feel free to refuse, neither the language of the request nor its substance demonstrated a degree of compulsion that approximated the deprivation of freedom of movement associated with formal arrest. Defendant was not confined to the principal's office or some other room in the school for the purpose of questioning. Defendant was not in custody for Miranda purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owners constructed a 15,000-square-foot addition and, later, a 5,000-square-foot addition, to a building they co-owned. The city issued the owners a citation for violating a city ordinance by failing to obtain a building permit. Because of the increased size of the building after the additions, the building became subject to requirements for the installation of a fire control device, such as a sprinkler system throughout the building or a fire wall. The circuit court ordered that the owners pay retroactive and prospective fines of $50 dollars per day because of their failure to install a fire control device. On appeal, the owners argued numerous issues, none of which the court deemed to have any merit. For example, the court held that the circuit court did not err by assessing a total of fines in excess of $50 because each fine was a separate offense and did not violate the limitation on fines without a jury under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14. Moreover, because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2-102 pertained to criminal misdemeanors, and this case involved a matter of civil procedure, the owners' argument that the city violated that statute in its prosecution was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, denied appellant landowners' motion to alter or amend, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04, after a jury awarded $504,000 as damages for the condemnation of their property. The condemnation action was brought in the context of executing a redevelopment plan drafted by appellee Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency (MDHA) and approved by the Metro Council. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion and erred in entering the original possession order. The appellate court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-20-105 restricted MDHA's power with respect to private property in an urban renewal area. The appellate court determined that no proof was offered by the landowners that would satisfy the second element of the Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-20-105 exception to the power of eminent domain. The trial court specifically found that such individual development by the landowners would frustrate the objectives of the urban renewal plan. The landowners could not bring themselves within the exception to eminent domain provided by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-20-105, and the trial court did not err in granting possession to the MDHA following the possessory hearing of May 24, 2001. Since the Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59 motion filed four years subsequent to the June 25, 2001, order of possession simply sought to relitigate matters that had already been adjudicated, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the employee, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, her employer and other individuals (employer), in the employee's action after her termination for common law and statutory retaliatory discharge, violations of 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, tortuous interference with an employment contract, defamation, and negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated from her position as a physician assistance and she subsequently filed an action against her employer for common law and statutory retaliatory discharge, violations of 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, tortuous interference with an employment contract, defamation, and negligence after her termination. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer and the court affirmed on appeal. The record did not support the employee's claims under the Tennessee Public Protection Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-1-304, because the record reflected that she was terminated for violating hospital protocols and policies. The employee admitted that she initiated a surgery consent form by partially completing the form. Her claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was also inappropriate because there was no evidence that the employer had any policies, customs, or practices that were in violation of the employee's First Amendment rights. Her defamation claim was without merit because she failed to establish the publication element and failed to establish that she suffered any injury as a result of the defamatory statements.</SPAN></P>
