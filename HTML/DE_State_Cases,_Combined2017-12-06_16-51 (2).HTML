Section 733 allowed a stepparent to seek custody of a stepchild who had lived with the stepparent and natural parent on the latter's death. Section 733 did not violate a fit natural parent's constitutional right to the custody of her child, as it did not allow the court to substitute its judgment for that of the natural parent, whose wishes the court had to consider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to an evaluating doctor, the child was not as invested in her relationship with the guardian's former husband and would rather spend time with her mother. The child had major academic needs as she was one to two grades below level and was a high risk for an &quot;academic disaster.&quot; The mother resided in a two-bedroom townhouse. There was no evidence to suggest that her home was unsuitable. The court had to balance increasing the mother's time with the consistency of the guardian's former husband's time with the child and the fact that the guardian had been the primary caretaker for approximately eight years. The court held it was in the child's best interest that the mother's visitation be expanded to every other weekend from Friday until Tuesday morning. The mother was also to have overnight visitation every other Monday evening, alternate with her weekend visitation. The circumstances did not support continuing the guardian's former husband's visitation because meaningful contact with the mother was more important for the child. It was not in the child's best interests to establish a schedule which consistently took time away from the mother's visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parent filed a motion under Del. Fam. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss a petition by a de facto mother (DFM) for visitation with the parent's child. The dismissal request was based on the assertion that Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 2401-2413, the third-party visitation statute, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DFM's de facto status was previously determined, and the court awarded the parties joint custody and shared residency of the child. However, the custody order was reversed on appeal pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 721(a) upon a finding that the DFM lacked standing to seek custody because it was not alleged that the child was dependent or neglected. Thereafter, a statutory modification pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 8-201(c) included a statutory provision for de facto parent status. Accordingly, the DFM filed her petition for visitation, and the parent sought dismissal. The court initially held that determination of the constitutional issue was necessary, as &sect;&sect; 2401-2413 superseded any common law visitation right. Del. H.B. 104 did not violate the one subject rule of Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. As Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2412(a) had a two-parent veto right over third party visitation that was not provided to single parents, it was in violation of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Based on a legislative intent that the two-parent provision not be severable, the full statute was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother filed a motion to dismiss a petition filed by petitioner, a putative de facto mother (DFM), seeking custody of the mother's child. Alternatively, she sought certification of her challenges to the constitutionality, interpretation, and application of Del. S.B. 84, codified at Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 8-201, to the Delaware Supreme Court pursuant to Del. Sup. Ct. R. 41(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially determined that certification pursuant to Rule 41(a) was not warranted, as it would not likely minimize the protracted nature of the litigation and the mother failed to show that it was an urgent and important matter. The court determined that &sect; 8-201 did not violate the Delaware separation of powers doctrine. Based on the controlling, unambiguous language of &sect; 8-201, it changed the law going forward, as intended by the legislature, and it did not nullify prior court decisions. S.B. 84, &sect;&sect; 5 and 6 were not considered because they were not incorporated in &sect; 8-201. There was also no violation of Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, as &sect; 8-201 did not embrace more than one subject and it was properly titled. There was no violation of the mother's fundamental rights, as &sect; 8-201 only affected the definition of a legal parent in Delaware. Recognition of that right did not infringe on another legal parent's rights. Equal protection was not violated, as &sect; 8-201 was not special legislation. Res judicata did not bar the claim, and estoppel did not apply although the DFM had sought third party visitation, based on Del. Fam. Ct. R. Civ. P. 8(g). The DFM had standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the parent's dismissal motion, and it denied her request to certify the matter to the Delaware Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of Delaware, petitioner husband filed a motion to reopen a divorce case and a stipulation and order with instructions to consider his constitutional arguments regarding a parentage determination under Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 8-606, 8-607 (Supp. 2008) of Delaware's Uniform Parentage Act (DUPA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Soon after their divorce, the husband discovered that he was not the father of the mother's six-year old autistic child. Before that time, the husband had a laudable fatherly affection and attachment to the child. However, after the discovery, the husband sought to sever all relationships between himself and the child. The court found, inter alia, that the two parties in the case did not have truly adverse interests. As such, the issue was not ripe and, thus, not justiciable. In addition, the husband lacked a &quot;sufficient personal stake&quot; in the supposed violated interests of legitimate or illegitimate children to have standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 8-606, 8-607. He neither alleged nor proved that he had standing to bring the asserted equal protection claim. In any event, DUPA was rationally related to a government interest. The Court was at a loss to understand how DUPA was overbroad by excluding something. Accordingly, the husband's arguments were all procedurally nonjusticiable and without substantive merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion was denied, and the husband's arguments were found to be procedurally nonjusticiable and without substantive merit.</SPAN></P>

They moved for reargument after the family court found that the law required the case to be decided on the record the Department made in denying their application. The Department filed a motion under Del. Fam. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, Del.

The family court held that by the 1980 amendment to &sect; 905, the General Assembly expressed a clear intent that the family court could consider appeals in the same manner as the superior court had. A remand was not mandatory. The family court could decide the case on the record the Department presented. However, it was premature to determine the sufficiency of the Department's record because that record had not yet been submitted. The Department alleged that the family court was legally wrong in holding that &sect; 905 appeals had to be on the record. The Department had a &quot;record&quot; for the family court to review. The documents that the Department admitted appellants were entitled to have in discovery was the record in the case, and it was the record on which the family court had to decide the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a 17 year old juvenile who had, at 13, pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual contact 2nd degree, sought, under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 1001, to expunge his juvenile adjudication, which had resulted in him becoming subject to Tier II risk level requirements of Delaware's Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification requirements of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 4120, 4121. The State opposed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rehabilitation, particularly as to youthful offenders, was a compelling State interest and it included the ability to expunge records. Statistics supported the conclusion that juvenile sex offender rehabilitation programs had a high rate of success, and a very low rate of recidivism. Placement on the sex offender registry did not supersede the court's discretion to expunge a juvenile record. While the State had the burden to prove a &quot;material objection&quot; as to why the expungement should not be granted, the juvenile had demonstrated very good reasons for seeking to have his record expunged. He was 12 years old when he acted out with his 7 year old male cousin. He had satisfied the basic requirements for expungement under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 1001(a). He had successfully completed a sex related rehabilitation program, and had been a model probationer. His guidance counselor testified he was a model student with no involvement in any controversies in the community, particularly any sexually questionable controversies. He was found to no longer be a risk to society. The State failed to demonstrate a material objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for expungement was granted. The juvenile's name was to be immediately removed from the Delaware Sex Offender Registry, and all obligations he previously had under the registration and notification requirements of the Delaware Sex Offender Registry and Notification statutes were to cease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father filed a petition for visitation with his son against respondent mother under Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 728(d) (1999). Petitioner paternal grandmother petitioned for grandparent visitation under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 1031(7)(b) (1999). Petitioner maternal grandmother filed a dependency/neglect petition. The trial court (Delaware) reserved decision on the matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court construed Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 728(d) (1999) as creating a rebuttable presumption since if the statute was construed as creating a conclusive presumption, the best interests of the child would be ignored. Since visitation was allowed under Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 710A(5) after a best interest consideration between a father and a child who was subject to sexual abuse, Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 728(d) (1999) was not interpreted as creating an unbreachable conclusive presumption. Visitation with the father would not endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair his emotional development. It was in the child's best interests to allow visitation. Although the father had been imprisoned for the statutory rape of the mother that resulted in the pregnancy, for at least some period of time during the father's incarceration, the parties agreed that they would continue their relationship when the father was released and raise their son together. The father was providing support for the child. Although the mother was not able to legally consent to a sexual relationship with the father, the parties had voluntarily had sex with each other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's petition was granted. The paternal grandmother was granted visitation with the child during the time designated for the father's visitation. The maternal grandmother's petition was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

P. 12(b)(1) and (6) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted with respect to a petition by respondent putative mother (PM), seeking custody of the AM's child and a determination of parentage under the Uniform Parentage Act of Delaware (UPA), Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 8-101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were formerly lesbian partners, and although only the AM legally adopted the child, the parties intended that both would serve as the child's parent. They went through the adoption process together and shared the expenses. Both parties assisted in the rearing of the child, but their relationship ended. The PM sought custody of the AM's child. The AM sought dismissal on the ground that the PM was not a &quot;parent.&quot; The court held that based on case law and the PM's claim under the UPA and as a &quot;de facto parent,&quot; dismissal was not appropriate. Although the family court had jurisdiction to determine custody matters under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 921, a custody proceeding could only be commenced under Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 721(a) by a &quot;parent&quot; or as otherwise provided by law. The court found that the PM did not establish a parent-child relationship under various provisions of the UPA. However, the PM met the five-factor test for being a de facto parent. Such a determination did not violate the AM's fundamental parental rights. A request for genetic testing was moot, and appointment of a guardian ad litem under Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 8-608 was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the AM's dismissal motion, and determined that the PM was a de facto parent. The court denied the AM's motion for genetic testing, and it denied the PM's motion for appointment of a guardian ad litem. All other requested relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over grandparental visitation, a mother filed a Petition for Stay/Termination of Grandparent Visitation pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 1031. The paternal grandparents filed a Petition for Rule to Show Cause, alleging that they were denied visitation. They also filed a Dependency/Neglect Petition for Custody, alleging the mother's children were dependent and neglected in the mother's care, and requested sole custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that although there were statements made by the children as to allegations of abuse by the grandparents, the statements were not credible, and reinstituting visitation would not seriously endanger the children's future emotional and psychological development. In fact, the evidence indicated that issues concerning the children's emotional and psychological development were attributable to the mother. As to the Petition for Rule to Show Cause, a finding of contempt was necessary in order to coerce the mother to comply with the court's orders, as she had a significant history of ignoring the court. After reviewing the definitions of dependent and neglected children under Delaware law, and the best interests factors, the court did not believe that custody should be removed from the mother. It was not in the children's best interests to be placed out of her care, under the factors of Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 722(a), as the children wished to continue to live with her, were very loyal to her, and seemed well-adjusted to their home and involved in community activities. Despite many problems, far more damage would be done to the children if they were placed elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Petition for Stay/Termination of Grandparent Visitation was denied. Visitation was to continue under a June 12, 1996, order. A finding of contempt was issued against the mother. The Dependency/Neglect Petition for Custody was denied. The attorney guardian ad litem was to select a new counselor for the children. A Temporary Guardianship Order of January 20, 2006, was rescinded, to the extent it awarded the grandparents temporary guardianship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner maternal grandparents filed a petition for visitation of their grandchildren. The court ordered that the grandparents be given supervised visitation with the children once every three weeks for one and half hours. Respondent mother filed a motion for reargument. The guardian ad litem filed an opposition to the mother's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the mother's challenge, the family court held that Delaware grandparent visitation statute, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10,&nbsp;&sect; 1031(7), was constitutional on its face and that the court did not abridge the mother's substantive due process rights by ordering visitation with the grandparents. The family court noted that the there was a compelling basis for the state's order to maintain the established relationship between the grandparents and the children. In addition, the family court found that &sect;&nbsp;1031 was narrowly tailored in that it limited standing to grandparents, placed the burden of proof on the grandparents to show that their visitation was in the children's best interest, and prohibited state interference with both parents' objection when they were living together. The family court also noted that the mother's determination that visitation with the grandparents would not be conducive to the children's best interest was given special weight. Finally, the family court concluded that there was no equal protection violation because Delaware has a compelling interest in protecting minors from traumatic loss by preserving an established grandparent-grandchild relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the natural parents' decision to terminate visitation was unreasonable and granting visitation to the grandmother would not interfere with the parent/child relationship. The court further found that the effect upon the child's physical and/or emotional well being outweighed the parents' right to deny visitation. It was unreasonable and not in the child's best interest to terminate the contact between child and grandmother. The grandmother was in fact the minor child's primary caretaker, as grandmother watched her during the day while mother worked, and also kept the minor child over night at times during the week. Additionally, the court found that the child had the potential to be exposed to physical harm, given that the mother had been in abuse relationships with the father and her last boyfriend. The court determined that consistent contact with grandmother would act as a safeguard to the child's exposure to domestic violence. The court believed that it was imperative for grandmother to stay involved in the child's life, not only as a means of emotional stability, but as means of ensuring that the child was not exposed to more violent behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was within 4 years of age of the under 16-year-old victim, challenged the constitutionality of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 768 on the ground that he was denied equal protection under the law, as he received greater punishment than an adult defendant would have received for the same crime. The family court found that the intent of the Delaware Legislature, as well as the Delaware courts, was to treat juvenile offenders in a different, and certainly never a harsher, manner than adult offenders, and to stress the importance of making every effort to rehabilitate the juvenile offender, except in the extreme cases where the juvenile offender demonstrated that he or she was not amenable to rehabilitative processes. The court acknowledged that it was fairly debatable that the statute viewed narrowly was rationally related to its purpose, that being the protection of under-16-year-old victims from unlawful sexual contact. Certainly, the statute was not patently arbitrary and without rational relationship to a legislative government interest. Therefore, defendant's constitutional arguments failed.</SPAN></P>

She underwent successful in-vitro fertilization, which was funded in part by her partner, who signed the embryo transfer form above the signature line for &quot;partner.&quot; The parties separated nine months after the child's birth, and the partner filed a pro se petition for visitation in which she referred to the child as &quot;my son from in-vitro.&quot; The mother later sought child support, and the court found that the partner qualified as a &quot;parent&quot; within the meaning of Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 501 et. seq. The court noted that even if it were unable to so find, it was satisfied that the partner had to be equitably estopped from asserting that she had no legal obligation to support the child. The court noted that the partner's acts and directives predating conception, while biologically not providing the genetic material necessary to conceive the child, constituted a symbolic act of procreation.

Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect;&sect; 1702 and 1704, all misdemeanors. She moved to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the court of common pleas did not have jurisdiction to hear the charges against her because they did not constitute crimes. Additionally, she contended that the statutes were constitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the owner/operator of a kennel, was charged with violating Del. Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect;&sect; 1702(e), 1704(a)(3), (e)(3), (e)(5), and (e)(4). Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 1714, the penalty to be imposed for a violation of each of those statutes was a fine. The court noted that, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 233, should a fine be imposed for conduct prohibited by statute, the conduct was a criminal offense, unless otherwise specified by the General Assembly. Since the charges against defendant would result in a fine if she was convicted, her conduct was considered a criminal offense. The provisions under which she was charged were silent as to the type of offense the prohibited conduct constituted. Therefore, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 233(c), those offenses had to be considered unclassified misdemeanors. The court had original jurisdiction to hear defendant's case under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 2701(b). Each of the statutes under which she was charged were clear on their face. It was not necessary for people of common intelligence to guess at their meaning and to differ as to their application. Thus, they were not constitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress the forced extraction of her blood at the police barracks on the basis that taking her blood in an unsanitary environment violated her rights against reasonable search and seizure under the provision of Del.

Defendant refused field sobriety tests. She was taken into custody and transported to the police barracks where she refused to consent to have her blood drawn Two officers held her down while her blood was drawn. Defendant was 5'3&quot; tall and weighs approximately 125 pounds. The court held that considering the severity of the crime, a misdemeanor, the existence of infectious diseases and viruses which could be present in the barracks, the intrusion without oversight into the personal privacy and bodily integrity at the station could not be what the legislature envisioned when it enacted the reasonable standard in the statute. In addition, defendant did not pose an immediate threat to the officers or the public. Thus, she was entitled to have the blood test suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, defendants made motions to dismiss charges of lewdness under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1341. Defendants specifically claimed that the statute was surplusage under existing Delaware law when compared with the indecent exposure statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 764, 765, and that the lewdness statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First defendant allegedly committed a lewd act by rubbing his crotch and licking his lips while looking at the alleged victim. Second defendant allegedly committed a lewd act by exposing his genitals to, and beginning to masturbate in the presence of, another alleged victim. Defendants argued that lewdness, which was not statutorily defined, had to be defined under common law, which required exposure of the naked body or genitals as an element, thus rendering Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1341 surplusage based on the codification of indecent exposure. Based on the legislative history, the court determined that the terms used in the lewdness statute did not necessarily include an exposure of the genital organs and, thus, the statute could not be invalidated as surplusage. While defendants claimed that &sect; 1341 was unconstitutionally vague as it would prohibit activities constituting an exercise of protected expressive or associational rights, the court held that the statute's terms narrowed criminal punishment to those acts that a person knew were likely to be observed by others and knew were likely to cause affront or alarm in the observer. Thus, the motions to dismiss were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied both defendants' motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant argued that the judgment by admission was defective because the tenant did not acknowledge the judgment in writing. The court held that a party who appeared and entered on the record a valid judgment by admission pursuant to Del. J.P. Ct. Civ. R. 54(g) had to do so in writing and fully explain the parameters of the judgment by admission to make a knowing, voluntary waiver of the party's trial and appeal rights. Further, to consent in writing or orally, a party defendant had to understand and acknowledge the full parameters of the judgment the defendant was consenting to. The court found that the use of the disjunctive &quot;and/or&quot; in Rule 54(a) created both ambiguity and confusion. The court found that the tenant did not make such an acknowledgment in writing, and therefore the judgment by admission was void. The court further held that the tenant did not consent to eviction or possession by the housing authority by paying the judgment entered by the magistrate because the tenant was not advised that the housing authority was going to be granted possession of the leased premises.</SPAN></P>
