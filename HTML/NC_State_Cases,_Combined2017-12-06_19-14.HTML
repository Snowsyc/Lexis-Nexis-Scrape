</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon, two counts of possession of a stolen firearm, one count of carrying a concealed weapon, and one count of driving while license revoked. Defendant admitted to attaining habitual felon status. The Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced him to 110 to 141 months' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court committed error by upholding the warrantless stop of his car based solely on the information provided to police by an anonymous tipster. While the tip at issue included identifying details of a person and car allegedly engaged in illegal activity, if offered few details of the alleged crime, no information regarding the informant's basis of knowledge, and scant information to predict the future behavior of the alleged perpetrator. Because the officers failed to corroborate the tip, the appellate court concluded that the tip lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the warrantless stop. The stop was justified, however based on the officer's knowledge that the driver's license of the registered owner of the vehicle was suspended and the scope of the stop should have been limited to that issue. Defendant also contended that his rights under the Fourth Amendment were violated by the search after his arrest for driving with a revoked license. The appellate court agreed, noting that the search occurred when defendant was on the police car and could not have accessed the passenger compartment of his car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying defendant's motion to suppress was reversed. Defendant's convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon, two counts of possession of a stolen firearm, and one count of carrying a concealed weapon were vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court for sentencing as to the driving while license revoked conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court, Forsyth County, North Carolina, defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree sexual offense and was sentenced to consecutive terms of 32 to 40 years' imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's half-brother's testified that when he was five and defendant was 11, defendant began sexually abusing him and forcing him to perform sex acts. The molestation continued until the victim turned 10. Defendant contended that there was no evidence that the abuse occurred during the time frame alleged in the bill of particulars. The appellate court disagreed. The victim was 10 years old during the entire time period set out in the indictment and bill of particulars. Although he could not recall the exact date of the last abuse, he testified that he was 10 at the time and that the abuse had been ongoing. Thus, there was substantial evidence that defendant abused him within the time period alleged in the bill of particulars. As defendant was 16 during the time frame when the abuse occurred, the trial court had jurisdiction over the matter under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-1604(a) (2009). As sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment was constitutionally permissible, the fact that defendant was 16 when he committed the crimes did not render his sentence of 32 to 40 years' imprisonment cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 27.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that sexual intercourse with his estranged spouse was consensual and that he hit her when he believed she was lying about where his cocaine was. He contended that the trial court erred in commenting before the jury that the case was &quot;not about anybody's drug use,&quot; in excluding evidence of the spouse's pattern of drug usage, and in ordering defendant's enrollment in lifetime satellite-based monitoring. The court rejected defendant's contentions. The trial court's comment was not prejudicial to defendant because immediately after the comment, defendant's counsel was allowed to ask the spouse about her drug use on the night in question. Defendant's contention regarding exclusion of evidence of the spouse's pattern of drug use was not supported by a specific offer at trial of proof of excluded evidence. Finally, the plain language of &quot;aggravated offense&quot; as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.6(1a) (2007) covered the essential elements of second degree rape, including the use of force, and defendant's conviction for an aggravated offense warranted his lifetime satellite-based monitoring pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.40A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no error in defendant's convictions or in the order for defendant's lifetime satellite-based monitoring.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court, Mecklenburg County (North Carolina), convicting him of second-degree murder, a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17, driving while impaired (DWI), a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138.1, and driving while license revoked (DWLR), a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-28, arising out of an automobile crash in which is passenger was killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the trial court found juror misconduct violating defendant's constitutional rights, it properly denied a motion for appropriate relief on the ground that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Next, double jeopardy did not apply because the legislature intended to create two separate offenses in DWI and second-degree murder as punishment for second degree murder was controlled by structured sentencing, while punishment for DWI was exempted from the structured sentencing provisions. Next, defendant failed to demonstrate prejudicial error regarding the jury instruction for DWLR. Although the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the State had proved defendant's knowledge of the suspension, it immediately correctly instructed that the State had the burden of providing defendant had received notice of the suspension. Accordingly, defendant failed to demonstrate prejudicial error. Next, there was no merit to defendant's argument that the trial court erroneously assigned prior record points to his out-of-state convictions. Finally, while the trial court erred in allowing expert testimony on Narcan, the error was harmless in light of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had moved to suppress all evidence discovered in the search of his jacket and vehicle and statements he made when apprehended. The trial court granted the motion to suppress as to the statements but denied the motion as to the cocaine in defendant's jacket. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's officer received a tip from a reliable, confidential source that defendant, whom he named, would that day be driving a green Grand Am with over 60 grams of cocaine within the city limits. This information was relayed by dispatch. An officer who had heard the dispatch observed a green Grand Am within the city limits and followed it. Defendant turned into a gas station without using his turn signal. The officer pulled up and detained defendant for failure to use his turn signal. When defendant saw other officers approaching, he ran, dropping a jacket containing 56 grams of cocaine. The court held that the failure to use the turn signal gave the officer reasonable suspicion to detain defendant because he was traveling in a through lane with medium traffic and was a short distance in front of the police officer. Therefore, the failure to use a turn signal could have affected another motor vehicle, violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-154(a) (2009). Additionally, the tip from the confidential informant was sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion. He identified defendant by a name the sheriff's officer recognized, described the specific car, and gave other specific information.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in determining whether the parties and causes were the same for the purpose of abatement by reason of the pendency of the prior action, the test was whether the two actions presented a substantial identity as to parties, subject matter, issues involved, and relief demanded. The parties were the same, and the subject matter of both lawsuits was the funds held by the Catawba County Clerk's office based upon a settlement order and DHHS's lien asserted pursuant to N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner accused filed a motion in the New Hanover County District Court (North Carolina), seeking expunction of his name from the Responsible Individuals List (RIL), alleging that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-323 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the petition. The trial court also denied the accused's motion to remove his name from the list and rejected his constitutional challenge. The accused appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was a child's biological father who had visitation with the child. The child's mother reported troubling behaviors of the child to the county department of social services. After an interview with the accused, he was placed on the RIL of persons identified as being responsible for child abuse or neglect. The accused attempted to expunge and remove his name from the list through the statutory procedures, while challenging the constitutionality of the procedures, but was unsuccessful. The court held that the procedure for placing the accused on the list violated his due process rights under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court noted than an individual could spend more than 169 days on the RIL before the clerk of court calendared an expunction hearing. Although the State had an interest in protecting children, it failed to show that inclusion on the RIL was required for social services or law enforcement to investigate reports of abuse or neglect or remove children from dangerous environments. Due process required the State to substantiate a report of child abuse or neglect by a preponderance of the evidence at a pre-deprivation hearing before adding a person to the RIL.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders of the district court and held that the statutory scheme governing placement of individuals on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) of those determined to have committed child abuse or neglect was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenges to economic incentive legislation enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly, appellants, three North Carolina taxpaying residents and citizens, sought judicial review of the decision by the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) granting an N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss by appellees, the State of North Carolina, various state officials, and two companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens argued that they had standing in their capacity as taxpayers to challenge the sales and use tax exemptions granted to eligible internet data centers in the 2006 Current Operations Appropriations Act as violative of the uniformity in taxation provisions of N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1) and 2(2) and the law of the land clause of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The citizens were not eligible to assert traditional taxpayer standing. The mere fact that they paid North Carolina income and sales and use taxes, without more, did not give them standing to challenge the sales and use tax exemption afforded to eligible internet data centers. Next, the trial court did not erroneously conclude that the residents lacked standing to pursue their fair tax claims because they were not in the class of taxpayers discriminated against by the sales and use tax exemptions for eligible internet data centers. Each of the three claims on appeal were discrimination-based. Finally, the trial court did not err by viewing the class to which the citizens had to belong as the class attempting to qualify for the exemption rather than the class subject to the tax itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) entered summary judgment in favor of appellees, a developer, a city, and a city planning commission. Appellants, a neighborhood association and property owners, argued, inter alia that they were entitled to challenge approval of a preliminary plan for a development and that their action was not barred by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-54.1 or 160A-364.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court incorrectly found that appellants' claims were barred by &sect; 1-54.1 and &sect; 160A-364.1. The particular local ordinance provisions that they attempted to challenge were included in the city's subdivision, rather than its zoning, ordinance. The limitations period relating to challenges to zoning ordinances set out in &sect;&sect; 1-54.1 and 160A-364.1 did not apply to challenges to the constitutionality of subdivision ordinance provisions of the type at issue in the present case. Appellants argued that Charlotte, N.C., City Code &sect; 20-88(a), resulted in a fundamental denial of due process as guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Appellants had not cited any authority in support of the proposition that they were entitled to constitutional protection against changes in the treatment of adjoining tracts of property under properly-adopted zoning or subdivision ordinances. They had asserted nothing more than a reliance on the continued existence of the existing legal situation coupled with a mere expectation that no change to which they objected would be made in the use of an abutting 16-acre tract of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trustee brought an action for declaratory relief against defendant trust beneficiaries in the Superior Court, Mecklenburg County (North Carolina), seeking to determine its ability to administer the trust as valid under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-23 (2007). The trustee filed a motion for summary judgment, and the beneficiaries filed a cross-motion. The trial court thus granted the trustee's motion, and the beneficiaries appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustor created a trust, naming the trustee and naming her three children as primary beneficiaries. In accordance with the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-23, the trust was intended to be perpetual, not subject to the rule against perpetuities. The beneficiaries argued that &sect; 41-23 violated section 34 of the Declaration of Rights, N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 34, which provided that perpetuities and monopolies were contrary to the genius of a free state and were not allowed. The court held that in the historical context of the passage of the North Carolina Constitution, a perpetuity was the attempt to forbid the alienation of lands under any circumstances, and to provide for their descent or disposition in a fixed, unchangeable way. Section 41-23(a) adopted the approach of requiring the existence of the power of alienation rather than requiring that remote future interests vest or terminate within a certain time period. Thus, under &sect; 41-23, a trust may remain valid in perpetuity as long as the appropriate rights of sale or termination are held.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trustees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress statements he made to law enforcement officers. Although defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress his statements, he failed to renew his objection at trial. On cross-examination, he elicited extensive testimony about the statements. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant's cross-examination testimony. Defendant did not object to the testimony or assign it as plain error. He made a conclusory allegation that admission of the testimony was plain error but did not argue that admission had a probable effect on the outcome of the trial. The issues the State commented upon during closing argument were pertinent to evidence introduced at trial, to defense counsel's closing argument, or to both. The trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the aggravating factor. The evidence was insufficient to establish that defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence, including a domestic relationship, to commit the offense. The evidence showed only that the victim &quot;trusted&quot; defendant in the same way she &quot;trusted&quot; any adult parent of a friend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not question whether he had refused to submit to a test or whether probable cause existed in order to compel a blood test. Therefore, the only issue was whether the police officer's belief was reasonable under the circumstances. Defendant contended that the officer's belief that the delay caused by obtaining a court order would result in the dissipation of his percentage of blood alcohol was unreasonable and not grounded in fact or knowledge. Competent evidence existed to suggest that her belief was reasonable. Defendant had failed multiple field sobriety tests and was unsuccessful at producing a valid breath sample using the Intoximeter at the police station. The trial court had before it competent evidence to support its finding that exigent circumstances existed to take a blood sample without a warrant. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-139.1 was not unconstitutional on its face nor in its application to the present case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator alleged that a promissory note addendum and release were void and unenforceable because (1) the deceased or seller lacked the mental capacity to assent to the addendum and release at the time of their execution, (2) they were procured through undue influence and duress, (3) they were procured through fraud, and (4) they were unsupported by consideration. The release failed to recite any consideration for the new agreement to release the buyer from having to continue to make payments on the promissory note in the event that the seller died prior to the debt being paid off in full. The release, moreover, provided that it reflected the entire understanding of the parties. Thus, according to the understanding of the parties, no consideration was exchanged in support of the new agreement, making it void and unenforceable. Neither in opposition to the motion for a directed verdict nor on appeal did the buyer argue that if allowed, he would have presented evidence showing that the release was, in fact, supported by consideration. The notary public's acknowledgment of the release was not equivalent to an execution of the release under seal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Pender County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway without the vehicle being registered in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-111(1) (2007) and of operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway without having in full force and effect the financial responsibility required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-313 (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect;&sect; 20-111 and 20-313 were unconstitutional. The court of appeals held that &sect;&sect; 20-111 and 20-313 bore a real and substantial relationship to public safety. Therefore, the General Assembly had ample authority under its police power to enact the sections and to make their violation a criminal offense. There were ample public safety justifications for the vehicle registration and financial responsibility requirements. If defendant did not wish to follow the statutory requirements, he could exercise his right to travel in a variety of other ways. If he wished, he could walk, ride a bicycle or horse, or travel as a passenger in an automobile, bus, airplane or helicopter. However, defendant could not operate a motor vehicle on the public highways. The purpose of &sect;&sect; 20-111 and 20-313 was very clear. Defendant  failed to demonstrate how the statutes failed to give him the type of fair notice that was necessary to enable him or anyone else operating a motor vehicle to conform their conduct to the law. Defendant failed to cite any legal authority supporting his arguments that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because he had no contractual relationship with the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's primary argument was that the court had to reexamine the holding of the Britt decision upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 14-415.1 in light of the Heller decision. In the Britt decision, Supreme Court of North Carolina declined to hold that &sect; 14-415.1 was unconstitutional on its face. Defendant argued unsuccessfully that the Heller decision required the court to examine the restriction upon his right to keep and bear arms under strict scrutiny and that under the strict scrutiny analysis the 2004 amendment to &sect; 14-415.1 was unconstitutional. Defendant's facial challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 14-415.1 failed since he had not established that no set of circumstances existed under which &sect; 14-415.1 would be valid. Under the five Britt factors, &sect; 14-415.1 was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. His arguments that &sect; 14-415.1 violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder had been considered and rejected by the court. Since the trial court had arrested judgment on 10 of the convictions and the State could reindict defendant, he could be placed in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 10 convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon where judgment was arrested were reversed. His remaining conviction upon which he was sentenced was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trooper's purpose was to &quot;to enforce any kind of motor vehicle law violations&quot; he might encounter. Defendant stopped at the checkpoint, and the trooper detected a strong order of alcohol coming from the vehicle and noticed that defendant's eyes were red and glassy. When he asked defendant to pull over, defendant ran over an informational sign. He admitted drinking several beers. The court held that defendant failed to challenge the findings of fact of the superior court; defendant merely urged the court to reweigh the factors regarding the reasonableness of the checkpoint. The court could not reweigh the factors as long as they were supported by the evidence, which they were. The primary purpose of the checkpoint was to determine if drivers were duly licensed and observing the motor vehicle laws of North Carolina. The trooper was aware of numerous violations from traffic in that area in the past. The trooper stopped every vehicle at the checkpoint.

Stat. &sect; 115C-431 (2007) and that &sect; 115C-431 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of education submitted a budget request to the board of county commissioners, which appropriated an amount less than the budget request. The court of appeals held that the board of education  complied with all the applicable statutory requirements, and the trial court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction when the board of county commissioners appropriated an additional sum to the board of education. Following the adoption of its budget ordinance, the board of education adopted a resolution that the amount appropriated to it for local current expense and capital outlay was insufficient to support a system of free public schools in the county. The parties took part in a joint public meeting and several mediation sessions but failed to reach an agreement. The board of education complied with the time limits of &sect; 115C-431(c) by filing its complaint within five days after an announcement of no agreement by the mediator. Under &sect; 115C-431(c), a school board had to present evidence of the amount of money it needed to maintain its school system and the amount it needed from the county in order to have the necessary amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) under Winston-Salem, N.C., City Ordinance &sect; 38-29 (Ordinance) for loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity. Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional on grounds of overbreadth and vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment alleged that defendant violated &sect; 38-29(b)(4) and (7). The Ordinance did not require proof of intent to violate a drug law, but imposed liability solely for conduct that manifested such purpose. The State's assertion that the present court upheld similar language in the Evans decision had no merit. The Ordinance did not require proof of specific criminal intent. It listed seven types of actions, each of which, by definition, was conduct that manifested a purpose to violate a drug law. Because the Ordinance failed to require proof of intent, it attempted to curb drug activity by criminalizing constitutionally permissible conduct. The Ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad. The Ordinance also failed to define what type of conduct violated &sect; 38-29(b)(4) and left ordinary persons uncertain on how to adhere to the law. That section was unconstitutionally vague, and it violated the Fourth Amendment. Defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence was not properly preserved for appellate review. Defendant also had not preserved his reasonable suspicion challenge to a stop by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's assignment of error that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of an officer's traffic stop of defendant was dismissed. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity was reversed, and his conviction was vacated. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) convicted defendant on a guilty plea of taking indecent liberties with a minor and sentenced him as a recidivist to 15-18 months imprisonment, suspended. The trial court also placed defendant on supervised probation and ordered him to register as a sex offender and to enroll in a satellite-based monitoring program for life under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.40. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred by subjecting him to lifetime satellite monitoring on the grounds that the date upon which he committed the offense antedated the effective date of &sect; 14-208.40 and that he received constitutionally deficient representation from his trial counsel because she failed to argue that subjecting him to lifetime satellite monitoring violated his federal and state constitutional rights against the enactment of ex post facto laws. Relying on a recent decision of another panel of the court of appeals, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument. Lifetime satellite-based monitoring was intended to be a civil and regulatory, rather than a punitive, regime. Thus, it was not an automatic result of defendant's guilty plea, unlike a mandatory minimum sentence or an additional term of imprisonment, so the fact that he was not advised that he might have been subjected to lifetime satellite-based monitoring at the time of guilty plea did not serve to invalidate his conviction. Additionally, the court was not persuaded that it should have exercised its discretion to take judicial notice of the interim guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The party's current status as a recognized political party through the 2012 general election did not exempt it from its obligation to continue to satisfy the requirement of N.C.

Stat. &sect; 163-96(a)(2) in the event that it was unable to retain its recognition as a political party. Therefore, the party's appeal was not moot. While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation, it also found that associational rights were not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly appeared beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-96(a)(2) was not violative of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12 or 14, or of the &quot;law of the land&quot; clause of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an implied-consent case, the State appealed a holding by the Superior Court, Mecklenburg County (North Carolina) that N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statutes did not violate the substantive due process, procedural due process, or equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.

On the face of the relevant state constitutional provisions alone, N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1, 13(2), and 12(3), (4), and (6), the General Assembly acted within its constitutional authority by enacting the challenged statutes that prescribed the jurisdiction of the district and superior courts, and provide a system of appeal from district to superior court. That statutory mechanism governed the procedure or practice for implied-consent offenses in the trial courts of North Carolina, as the General Assembly was constitutionally authorized to do by article IV, &sect; 13.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was suspended for 10 days because of her involvement in a fight at school. Additionally, the principal recommended to the superintendent a long-term suspension for the minor for the remainder of the school year. The superintendent followed this recommendation and suspended the minor for the remainder of the school year. The minor alleged defendants' failure to provide an alternative education program for a student given a long-term suspension violated her constitutional right to a free public education. The appellate court found that the disposition of students who had been expelled or suspended long term was ultimately a decision involving the administration of the public schools, a decision which was best left to the legislature. The legislature had clearly considered the issue of alternative education for students who were either suspended long term or expelled, and it did not make access to alternative education mandatory. Under the circumstances, the minor was without an adequate administrative remedy and her claim was properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered by the Superior Court, Wilkes County, North Carolina to enroll in satellite-based monitoring (SBM) for seven to ten years pursuant to his no contest plea to indecent liberties with a child. Defendant argued, inter alia, that requiring SBM enrollment on the basis of crimes committed before enactment of the SBM statutory scheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the satellite-based monitoring (SBM) enrollment statutory scheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it increased the punishment for a crime after the crime was committed. The appellate court found that although defendant argued that because mandatory GPS monitoring did not exist on the date he committed the underlying offense, the SBM statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.40B (2007), violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution by increasing his permissible punishment after the offense was committed, the appellate court had carefully considered and overruled an identical challenge to the SBM statute in State v. Bare, N.C. App., 677 S.E.2d 518, 531 (2009), and Bare controlled the instant case. With respect to defendant's argument that the trial court erred by ordering him to enroll in SBM for an indefinite period of time, seven to ten years, the appellate court found that in the absence of any statutory provisions to determine when an offender's monitoring would end if his &quot;period of time&quot; was a range of time, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.40B(c) required the trial court to set a definite time period for defendant's enrollment in SBM.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded the trial court order requiring defendant to enroll in satellite-based monitoring (SBM) for further findings of fact regarding whether defendant required the highest possible level of supervision and monitoring, and if so, for the trial court to determine a definite time period for which defendant should have been required to enroll in SBM.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation appealed a judgment entered following a bifurcated trial in which plaintiff patron was awarded $ 10,000 in compensatory damages in the first phase of the trial and $ 350,000 in punitive damages in the second phase. The Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) subsequently reduced the punitive damages award to $ 250,000. The corporation only challenged the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary contention of the corporation was that its judgment notwithstanding the verdict motion should have been granted for insufficient evidence that the patron's injuries were related to willful or wanton conduct attributable to the corporation; however, ample evidence supported the jury's verdict. The testimony elicited by the corporation's counsel would have permitted the jury to draw the favorable inference that once the corporation had notice of an incident, it would take corrective measures to ensure that such an incident would not happen again, thus negating the need to impose punitive damages to deter further misconduct. The patron was entitled to attempt to rebut this inference by showing that the corporation, when it received notice of similar allegations on a prior occasion, did not advise its regional operations directors of those allegations. The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the patron, was sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably conclude that the assistant manager's refusal, pursuant to corporate policy, to find out what the patron ingested and learn what first aid was necessary was related to the patron's injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The punitive damages award was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens filed an action against defendants, the State and the Governor, alleging that transfers by the Governor and the General Assembly from the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund to the General Fund of the State were unlawful diversions of Trust Fund assets and violated N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 5. They challenged an order of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted the State and Governor summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-187.9(2) (2007) directed that a portion of the Trust Fund be transferred each year to the General Fund. The court of appeals held that one of the objects of the Trust Fund was to supplement the General Fund. Therefore, use of the Trust Fund monies for that purpose was not a &quot;raid&quot; of the Trust Fund for purposes not previously sanctioned by the General Assembly. The transfer of $ 80,000,000 by the Governor from the Trust Fund to the General Fund exceeded his constitutional authority under N.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. Section 5 was a grant of authority to the Governor, which was limited to escrowing or reducing budgeted expenditures and did not create a power to transfer and spend funds appropriated for one purpose to another without statutory authority. The Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 2001 was not followed in the transferring of the money because the Governor transferred it directly into the General Fund without awaiting legislative action. While the Governor could &quot;escrow&quot; the Trust Fund monies to prevent a deficit, he could not transfer appropriated Trust Fund monies without awaiting appropriate legislative authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals revered in part the trial court's order denying the citizens' motion for summary judgment and granting the State and Governor summary judgment. It affirmed the decision of the trial court with regard to the $ 125,000,000 statutory transfer by the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that defendant's enrollment in SBM did not violate prohibitions against ex post facto law or double jeopardy. The legislature did not intend SBM to be a criminal punishment. Mere involvement of the criminal process in aid of a statutory regime did not render the statutory scheme itself punitive. The 2007 amendment to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.42 made a substantive change. The requirements of SBM were different from the conditions of unsupervised probation required by the 2006 statute. The amendment established a different way of maintaining SBM that was not merely a &quot;cosmetic&quot; change. The involvement of courts of law and superior court judges did not indicate a punitive legislative intent. The superior courts had jurisdiction regarding many different types of civil matters. Defendant had not been prosecuted a second time but contended that he was subjected to additional punishments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the demolition of a structure on their property, plaintiff property owners filed a complaint against defendant city in the Pasquotank County Superior Court, alleging claims of 1) unconstitutional taking without just compensation, 2) destruction of property, 3) violation of due process, 4) trespass, and 5) denial of equal protection. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, and the owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased the property at a sheriff's sale in 2003 but did not record the deed until 2005. In 2004, the city condemned the property as unfit for human habitation. The city mailed notices to the former owners and posted a notice of condemnation on the property. The former owners wrote to the city that they no longer owned the property and it had been sold at a sheriff's sale. In January 2005, the structure was demolished. The former owners appeared as the owners of record in both the Register of Deeds and Tax Department offices. However, the owners' address was listed on the tax bill. The owners argued that the former owners' letter should have alerted the city that there were other owners of the property who required notice. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-443 (2007), the city was required to have procedures to give notice to the owners and interested parties, as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-442 (2007). Although there was no genuine issue of fact as to what steps the city took in attempting to ascertain to whom they should send notice, reasonable minds could differ as to whether the steps taken were sufficient. Therefore, the city was not entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent patient challenged an order of the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina), which recommitted him to involuntary inpatient treatment after concluding that he failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was no longer mentally ill or dangerous to others pursuant to the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122C-276.1 (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was found not guilty by reason of insanity following a murder trial. He was involuntarily committed to a state mental health facility. He argued that the Act authorized a conditional release as a dispositional option. The court of appeals held that because the trial court was unaware that it had the option of conditionally releasing respondent, it made its findings of fact and conclusions of law under a misapprehension of the law. The Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 122C-264, -268.1, -276.1, and -277 (2007), established the trial court's authority to order a conditional release of an insanity acquittee as a dispositional option in &sect;&sect; 122C-268.1 and 122C-276.1 hearings. The trial court found that there was a reasonable probability that respondent's seriously violent conduct would be repeated and that he would be dangerous to others in the future if unconditionally released. The trial court did not make findings of fact that such a reasonable probability existed in the absence of an unconditional release. The court of appeals could not determine that the trial court, if aware that a conditional release was a legal disposition, would still have recommitted respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed the trial court's commitment order and remanded the case for a hearing de novo to decide whether respondent met his burden of proof, and if he had, whether he would be conditionally or unconditionally released. It left to the trial court's discretion whether to base the new decision on the existing record or whether to hear additional evidence given the parties' focus on recommitment versus unconditional release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal arose from the parties' disagreement about the application and interpretation of restrictive covenants recorded in a consent judgment. Plaintiff sought a declaration that the covenants contained in the consent judgment, and in specific, the limitation on placement of an entryway, were unenforceable and improper in all respects and asserted various grounds for a declaration that the restrictive covenants were not enforceable. Defendants brought a counterclaim for a declaration that the restrictive covenants were valid and binding on plaintiff, including the covenants addressing the siting of a driveway on the property. The instant court found that the restrictive covenants did not forbid plaintiff from siting its driveway on a particular public road. Nor did the covenants state that plaintiff could not build a driveway off the same road that connected defendants' neighborhood with Weaverville Road. The covenants did not state that the only location plaintiff may place a driveway was at Location A.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, upon a guilty plea, of taking indecent liberties with a child. Defendant appealed a judgment entered by the Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of willfully failing to comply with the change of address requirements applicable to registered sex offenders under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11(a)(2), and his sentence to 107 to 138 months of imprisonment, after the denial of his motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that defendant was residing in public housing when the person he was staying with was evicted due to defendant's status as a sex offender. The locks on the apartment were changed, and defendant stopped living in the public housing apartment. Defendant left the public housing apartment on or before August 10, 2005 and failed to report a new address until September 16, 2005. Defendant's claim that he did not have a permanent address, and that he was not required to register a temporary address was rejected. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-208.9(a) and 14-208.11(a)(2) operated on the premise that everyone, at all times, had an address. There was ample support for the verdict convicting defendant of failing to provide timely notice of his change of address in violation of &sect; 14-208.11(a)(2). It was not error to deny defendant's motion to dismiss at the close of the evidence. Finally, defendant did not preserve his void for vagueness challenge to &sect;&sect; 14-208.9(a) and 14-208.11(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by plaintiff local boards, and others, against defendant state board, the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) found that the state board failed in its constitutional duty to provide a sound basic education in rural districts, and directed the state board to remedy deficiencies. Later, the trial court denied a motion for attorneys' fees and costs filed by the local boards. The local boards appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification stated that, inter alia, the interlocutory denial of the motion for attorneys' fees was an ancillary matter and did not affect the on-going proceedings in the case. The appellate court found that this appeared to have been the exact opposite of what was necessary to establish a substantial right required for an interlocutory appeal. Nevertheless, the appellate court elected to invoke its N.C. R. App. P. 2 power to hear this appeal notwithstanding the fact that the order was interlocutory. The state took no affirmative actions against the local boards, and the state's failure to act was not be extrapolated into &quot;state action&quot; for purposes of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-19.1 (2007). Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that &sect; 6-19.1 did not apply. Neither the common fund doctrine nor the substantial benefit doctrine were applicable. None of the theories upon which the local boards relied supported an award of attorneys' fees, and the trial court's order was without error.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile had previously been adjudicated as delinquent and admitted to subsequent probation violations. The trial court erred by failing to entertain the juvenile's motion to review the order of secure custody under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-1906(b) (2007).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by finding that he was subject to lifetime satellite-based monitoring when he was not advised, before his 1994 guilty plea in Wilkes County to various offenses, and his 2007 guilty plea in Haywood County to misdemeanor sexual battery, that the monitoring might have been imposed as a result of his pleas. However, defendant admitted that the statute as written applied to him and subjected him to lifetime satellite-based monitoring. Defendant did not object at trial to the imposition of the monitoring based on this argument, and thus, the appellate court found that this argument was subject to dismissal pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1). Further, defendant did not object at the hearing on the grounds that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.40(a)(1) was void for vagueness. In fact, defendant admitted that his conduct constituted recidivist behavior as defined by the statute, and having admitted that he was a recidivist as defined by the statute, he was not permitted to argue on appeal that the provisions for determining recidivism were unconstitutionally vague. The monitoring was not a punishment, and thus did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of willfully violating the change of address requirements applicable to registered sex offenders in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11(a)(2). The Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced defendant to a term of 107 to 138 months incarceration in the custody of the North Carolina Department of Correction.  Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss at the close of all evidence. The appellate court disagreed, finding ample evidence to support the jury's verdict convicting defendant of failing to provide timely notice of his change of address, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11(a)(2). Among other things, the evidence showed that defendant moved from his old address and knew that he only had ten days to notify the sheriff's department of his move, but that defendant did not notify the sheriff's department of his change of address until at least a month later. While defendant argued that he had not established a new &quot;address&quot; until the date upon which his submitted the change of address, the appellate court found that defendant did not intend to return to his old address or hold that location out to the public as his address. After defendant left his old address, the evidence tended to show that he may have traveled from place to place within his hometown. However, there was also substantial evidence in the record tending to show that defendant changed his address to a new location more than 10 days prior to recording the change of address.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the seizure was unreasonable because it was based on an uncorroborated anonymous tip which lacked a sufficient indicia of reliability. The appellate court disagreed. Contrary to defendant's contention, the stop was not based on an anonymous tip from an unknown, unaccountable informant. A victim of the fight/assault provided information to an officer that the offender was a tall white male that had been driven away from the scene in a small, dark car that was operated by a white female with blond hair. The officer's stop was not based solely on the victim's description, but also on the officer's own observations of defendant's hurried actions, the fact that it appeared to the officer that defendant was trying to avoid him, and defendant's proximity to the scene of the assault. Defendant also contends she did not match the tipster's description because she was driving a small light-colored car with a female passenger instead of a small dark car with a male passenger. The fact that the car did not exactly match the description did not render the stop unreasonable and at the time of the stop, the officer could not tell if the passenger was male or female.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with willfully operating a motor vehicle while subject to an impairing substance. He filed a pretrial motion pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-38.6(a). A district court granted the motion under &sect; 20-38.6(f). The State appealed under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-38.7(a). It challenged an order of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which found that &sect;&sect; 20-38.6 and 20-38.7 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the State had no statutory right of appeal pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1445(a)(1) from the superior court's interlocutory order. However, it granted the State's petition for writ of certiorari due to the substantial questions at issue. By enacting &sect;&sect; 20-38.6(a), (f) and 20-38.7(a), the General Assembly created rules that affected the procedure and practice of the superior and district court divisions only, as it was permitted to do under N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, cl. 2. The superior court erred by concluding that &sect;&sect; 20-38.6(a), (f) and 20-38.7(a) violated the Former Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. The State's right to appeal a district court's preliminary determination indicating that it would grant a defendant's pretrial motion to suppress or dismiss made in accordance with &sect; 20-38.6(a) did not deprive defendants charged with implied-consent offenses of their guaranteed freedom from former jeopardy. Sections 20-38.6(a), (f), and 20-38.7(a) did not violate the Due Process Clause because they were not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious and were substantially related to the valid object sought to be obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed the order and remanded the matter to the superior court with instructions to remand the case to the district court to enter a final order granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court entered an order granting the Secretary's motion for summary judgment. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a multistate corporation operating discount retail stores. All real property pertaining to the store premises was transferred from the parent company of the taxpayer to a newly established business trust. An affiliated property company owned all of the voting units of the business trust. Thus, the business trust owned and leased stores within North Carolina, passed along income to the property company received from leasing and subleasing those stores, which the property company further passed along to the taxpayer in the form of dividends. The gravamen of the taxpayer's complaint was that the Secretary of Revenue of the State of North Carolina had no authority to force the combination of the taxpayer with the business trust and the property company for the purpose of reporting taxable income. On appeal, the court found that (1) N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-130.6 (1999) provided the Secretary with authority to combine the three entities for the purpose of reporting taxable income, (2) &sect; 105-130.6 was constitutional under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, N.C. Const.&nbsp;art. V, &sect; 2(2) and N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(6), and (3) the Secretary's administration of &sect; 105-130.6 was lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that plaintiff had violated N.C. R. App. P. 28(b) by including argumentative assertions, facts unsupported by reference to the record, and irrelevant facts in his statement of facts and by failing to support his assertions with legal authority. The court, however, would address the merits. Plaintiff's argument that he was not a taxpayer had been rejected in a previous appeal by plaintiff. Nothing supported his argument that property conveyed by bill of sale was not subject to ad valorem taxation. Next, because plaintiff had not included a transcript of a hearing during which the trial court allegedly made certain statements, the court could not reach the merits. The challenged statements, however, appeared to be innocuous, accurate statements of fact. There was no merit to plaintiff's argument that the trial court was unauthorized to enter summary judgment for defendant because defendant had not requested summary judgment. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (2007) authorized such a ruling.

He sought review of the judgment of the Orange County District Court (North Carolina), which, on remand from the court for the trial court to make findings of fact to support its denial of defendant's motion to suppress, filed and entered its order making findings of fact, conclusions of law, and denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a seventh-grader, was escorted into a room at school to be interviewed regarding his involvement in a crime. He was not administered Miranda warnings. During this interview, defendant admitted to entering the houses and taking certain items with another juvenile. Following the interview, police obtained a search warrant and searched defendant's home. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress, rejecting defendant's contention that his statement occurred during a custodial interrogation where officers failed to offer the proper warnings under Miranda and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-2101(a) (2005). The court reviewed the trial court's findings of fact and held that a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have believed himself to be in custody or deprived of his freedom of action in some significant way. The trial court found that defendant was not searched or handcuffed, that he began speaking with the investigator only after agreeing to answer questions, that his responses and questions indicated that he understood that he did not have to answer questions, and that he was allowed to leave the school when the bell rang.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor sued appellee insurance agents in the Superior Court, Duplin County (North Carolina), for negligence and breach of contract. The insurance agents filed an answer which included the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. The insurance agents filed a motion for summary judgment under that defense. The trial court allowed the motion and dismissed with prejudice the contractor's action. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor relied upon the insurance agents to obtain insurance for the contractor's needs. However, in a personal injury lawsuit, it was determined that products completed operations coverage for the contractor did not exist under an insurance policy for work that the contractor performed on a project. The contractor therefore asserted that the insurance agents failed to obtain the necessary insurance coverage for the contractor's operations. On appeal, the court found that the insurance agents were not providers of professional services for purposes of the extended statute of limitations under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15(c) (2005). Therefore, the statute of limitations under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-52 for general negligence and breach of contract claims was applicable. In addition, the contractor had no valid argument regarding extension of the statute of limitations under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-52(16) (2005) due to late discovery of the lack of insurance coverage. Thus, the contractor's causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations because its complaint was filed approximately three years and nine months after the latest date that its claims could possibly have accrued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner retiree sought review of a determination of respondent director which denied the retiree a tax free pension under the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System (CJRS) and the Teachers' and State Employees Retirement System (TSERS). The Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) affirmed the director's declaratory ruling. The retiree appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to be entitled to a tax-free pension, an employee had to be vested in the CJRS and the TSERS, by completing five continuous years of service, as of August 12, 1989. Although the retiree had completed five years of service before that date, he withdrew his contributions from those systems and left public employment. Later, after August 12, 1989, he returned to public employment, and eventually repaid the money he had withdrawn from the CJRS and the TSERS. The retiree argued that his repayment of contributions withdrawn before August 12, 1989 entitled him to a tax-free pension. The appellate court disagreed. The retiree was not vested as of August 12, 1989. Read together, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 135-4, 135-5 made clear that a member who left state service and withdrew contributions in the retirement system had no rights to any benefits within the system except for the right to repay previously withdrawn contributions as provided in &sect; 135-4. The repayment served only to increase the years of service creditable. Further, the director's interpretation in denying the retiree's request was reasonable and based on a permissible construction of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant humane society sought to intervene in a lawsuit originally brought by appellee owner of a gun club challenging the constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-360. Earlier, following appeals and remands, the Superior Court, Granville County (North Carolina), entered a permanent injunction against prosecution of the owner under &sect; 14-360. The trial court denied the humane society's motion to intervene. The humane society appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The humane society claimed that, due to an amendment of 15A N.C. Admin. Code 10B.0121, the injunction preventing prosecution of the owner pursuant to &sect; 14-360 should have been dissolved. However, the appellate court found that the humane society failed to file its motion to intervene pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 24 (2003), in the appellate court until more than three years after the amendment, and failed to file its motion to intervene in the trial court until nearly three and a half years after the amendment. While the humane society was involved in the original appeal of the case through the filing of an amicus curiae brief, and though the humane society made attempts to persuade the defendants to pursue the matter, the trial court's ruling that the motion to intervene was not timely filed was not so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision. Further, the humane society did nothing for two years after the amendment until it began pressuring the defendants to move to dissolve the injunction. The humane society's claim that it was unaware an injunction had been entered by the trial court was not persuasive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Nash County Superior Court (North Carolina) denied defendant's motion to dismiss, a jury convicted defendant of keeping more than three dogs at her residence in violation of Nashville, N.C., Ordinance &sect; 4.3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 4.3, limiting the number of dogs that she could keep in her residence, was unconstitutional, and that the restrictions of no more than three dogs over five months of age was inherently arbitrary. The appellate court found, however, that &sect; 4.3 did not set an arbitrary, immutable limit on the number of pets. Rather, the number of dogs allowed was based on the square footage of the lot. Further, there was no restriction on the number of dogs less than five months old. The fact that Nashville, North Carolina chose to regulate by size of lot, number of dogs, and age of dogs rather than by size or breed of dog did not render the ordinance arbitrary and unconstitutional. The record revealed that the town enacted &sect; 4.3 to reduce noise and odor problems within the city limits. These objectives were clearly legitimate public purposes, and a limitation on the number of dogs per lot was directly connected to these objectives. Defendant failed to meet her burden of showing that &sect; 4.3 was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unrelated to the public health and welfare of the citizens of the town. The ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee town sued appellant real estate developers in the Moore County Superior Court (North Carolina), for violation of a zoning ordinance. The town requested an injunction ordering the developers to comply with the ordinance by installing a minipark and reserving open space in a subdivision. The court granted the town's motion for summary judgment and ordered the developers to install a minipark and provide open space. The developers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town enacted a zoning ordinance which required developers of new residential developments to provide miniparks and open space for the use of their residents. Before the ordinance was adopted, the developers obtained the town's approval and began development of a subdivision. Although the developers initially agreed to comply with the ordinance, they later informed the town that they did not intend to comply with the ordinance. On appeal, the court found that the developers, rather than directly challenging the ordinance, waited to object to the ordinance until after the town sought to enforce it. Accordingly, the developers could not collaterally attack the validity of the ordinance. In addition, the court found that (1) the town was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance against the developers; (2) the town was entitled to seek an injunction pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160A-375 and 160A-389 (2007); (3) the developers, because they failed to make a showing that enforcement of the injunction would be inequitable, failed to establish any unconstitutional impairment of contract under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; and (4) the enactment of the ordinance was not a taking.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress because (1) the police did not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment rights by interrogating defendant when the police placed a phone call from an interrogation room to his grandmother to inform her that defendant was going to jail or by then allowing defendant to converse with her on a speaker phone in the presence of a detective and an interpreter; and (2) suppression was not required due to the State of North Carolina's failure to inform defendant of his right to contact the Honduran Consulate. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-910 (2007) in allowing testimony disclosed on the eve of trial when defendant did not request a recess or continuance to address the newly disclosed evidence. Finally, even assuming that the trial court erred in deciding to instruct the jury pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1235 (2007), given the absence of any indication of deadlock or coercion, any error was not prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court should have excluded, based on the attorney-client privilege, portions of his former attorney's testimony at the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The appellate court concluded that the subject statements were not privileged, because the information was disclosed so that counsel could provide it to the prosecutor in an attempt to negotiate a plea arrangement. Even assuming the conversation was privileged, its admission did not prejudice defendant given the other evidence of his guilt. Defendant also claimed the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant's delay far exceeded the lapse of time permitted in other cases, and that there was no indication that defendant did not fully understand the consequences of his plea. Finally, the appellate court concluded that there was no error in defendant's sentence, as the prohibition on ex post facto laws was not implicated by application of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.14(c); the increased sentence due to the classification change only enhanced his present sentence, and did not punish defendant for his prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

P. 12(c), and dismissal fo the complaint pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) granted the city's motion for summary judgment.

A officer's condition worsened after six years on the job and the officer went on sick leave. The officer sought disability retirement benefits. While waiting on a decision from the medical review board, the officer was arrested for attempting to sell marijuana and was suspended pending possible termination. The medical review board determined that the officer would work as a records specialist, but the officer was ineligible at the time of the offer due to his suspension. On appeal, the officer argued that the trial court erred in granting the city's motion for summary judgment in violation of the officer's substantive due process rights. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the officer never had a protected property interest in disability retirement benefits under the applicable city ordinance. The appellate court also agreed with the trial court that the officer's breach of contract claim was barred by the applicable two year statute of limitations, having been filed more than six years after the conducting supporting the claim.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant had a prior conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor, he was classified as a recidivist under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.6(2b). Therefore, the trial court determined that he was subject to SBM. The court of appeals held that the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction in the case. Defendant was a person who fit the criteria the legislature intended for participation in the SBM program. The legislation became effective 16 August 2006. Defendant completed his sentence and was eligible for release, but not eligible for post-release supervision, after the effective date of the legislation. A prior conviction did not have to be reportable to be considered by the trial court when making the recidivism determination. Defendant could not prove either element of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Although trial counsel was a bit disorganized and inartfully presented defendant's constitutional arguments, trial counsel's performance did not rise to the level of deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine pursuant to N.C. Gen.

The appellate court found that the record did not establish a knowing and voluntary waiver of jury trials when the guilty plea and admission of habitual felon status were entered on misunderstandings that the denials of defendant's pretrial motions were preserved for appellate review. Based upon defendant's guilty plea, he had a right to appeal only the denial of his motion to suppress.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Durham County Superior Court (North Carolina) dismissed an action brought by appellants, former and current minority students, under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a cause of action against appellees, board of education, school officials, and county officials. The suit challenged the school's disciplinary process on due process and equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A smaller group of students appealed, limiting their claims to those under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983(3), N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 15, 19 and art. IX, &sect; 2, and the Fourteenth Amendment against the superintendent and the board. The court reviewed the merits of the claims because the students' failure to timely file the record of appeal was not jurisdictional; however, sanctions were warranted under N.C. R. App. P. 34(b). It was error to dismiss the short-term suspension claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; allegations that a board policy barred appeal sufficiently alleged futility. Dismissal of the supervisory liability claim under &sect; 1983 was proper; there was no allegation that the superintendent had knowledge. Dismissal of the deceased student's futility claim on qualified immunity grounds was error. A reasonable superintendent would have known that procedural due process rights were being violated. The equal protection claims, asserting racial profiling and false accusations of gang membership, were inconsistent with claims that students of other races were accused of gang membership. There were sufficient allegations that the gang policy was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of all claims except the procedural due process claim brought on behalf of a student who was deceased. The court reversed the dismissal as to the constitutional challenge to the board's policy relating to gangs and gang activity. The court remanded the deceased student's claim and the gang policy claim for further proceedings. The court ordered appellants' counsel to pay the printing costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowner challenged a final judgment entered in favor of plaintiff county water and sewer district in the New Hanover County Superior Court (North Carolina) in the district's condemnation action. The trial court determined that the landowner failed to plead or appear in the time allowed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 40A-46 (2007) regarding the justness of the compensation deposited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district wanted to obtain an easement for a sewer line along the property line of the landowner's vacant lot. It adopted a resolution authorizing condemnation of sewer utility easements on the property and sent the landowner a notice of action. The district filed a complaint against the landowner. The civil summons incorrectly notified the landowner that he had thirty days to respond to the complaint, rather than 120 days allowed by &sect; 40A-46. The landowner filed an answer, denying that $ 12,000.00 was just compensation for the taking. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in awarding final judgment for the district. The trial court's finding that the landowner did not file an answer within 120 days of service of the complaint supported its conclusion of law that $ 12,000 was just compensation. The landowner failed to show that the district abused its power by proceeding to final judgment. The district was not on notice that the landowner appeared in the case until after the 120-day time limit had passed. The landowner received ample notice and opportunity to contest the amount of just compensation. The error in the civil summons did not prejudice him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138.1 (2007) was unconstitutional because the provision that states that &quot;[t]he results of a chemical analysis shall be deemed sufficient evidence to prove a person's alcohol concentration, constituted a mandatory presumption violative of defendant's right to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the challenged provision did not create an evidentiary or factual presumption, but simply stated the standard for prima facie evidence of a defendant's alcohol concentration. The appellate court concluded that the meaning of the phrase &quot;shall be deemed sufficient evidence to prove&quot; was that properly admitted results of a chemical analysis must be treated as prima facie evidence of a defendant's alcohol concentration. In other words, the statute simply authorized the jury to find that the report was what it purported to be - the results of a chemical analysis showing defendant's alcohol concentration. The appellate court further concluded that there was no error in the jury instructions, as they adequately informed the jury of the law as applied to the evidence presented at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent and siblings entered into a family trust agreement, which named them as trustees. After the decedent died, the siblings transferred the principal of his trust to a charity. The widow filed a petition for elective share under &sect; 30-3.1. The court of appeals held that she failed to establish that the clerk of the superior court did not comply with the procedural requirements of &sect; 30-3.4, which did not preclude resolution of the elective share issues on summary judgment. The widow also failed to show that the superior court applied an improper standard of review. The superior court conducted a de novo review and did not err in affirming the clerk's decision based on its construction of the effective date of the Act, rather than on the clerk's statutory analysis. The assets in the decedent's trust were not part of his total net assets. The decedent did not have legal title within the meaning of &sect; 30-3.2(4)(a). Legal title to the trust assets was held collectively by the trustees. The taxable estate was zero because the trust assets were all transferred to the charity.

At issue was the city's ability to charge different rates to water customers outside its limits considering 1933 N.C. Sess. Laws 376, 2005 N.C. Sess. Laws 246-47, and N.C. Gen.

The court further upheld the constitutionality of Sullivan II and Sullivan III, concluding that neither related to health and sanitation. The court upheld the trial court's determination that the Sullivan Acts were constitutional as a valid exercise of legislative authority and that they were not local acts in violation of N.C.

Upon the death of either trustor, the trust was to inure to the benefit of the surviving trustor and the children. The administrator and creditors filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that pursuant to the Uniform Trust Act, the trust assets were subject to the creditors' claims because the trust was revocable at the time of the decedent's death. The court of appeals held that under the terms of the trust document, there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the revocability of the trust. The trustee did not specifically allege that the trust was not revocable. The trial court did not err in finding that the Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36C-5-505(a)(3) (2007), applied. The decedent died with the power to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the trust. Therefore, the trust would be included in his gross estate for estate tax purposes. Until the moment of his death, the trust was revocable. The beneficiaries of a revocable trust had no vested rights, merely an expectancy. Therefore, they had no constitutionally protected rights to the trust assets.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 135-8(f)(3). Defendants, the State, its governor and state officials, appealed the summary judgment in favor of the class on its claims for a declaratory judgment under N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 6(2) and under the Contract Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class sued in response to the governor's Executive Order No. 3 requiring state employers to forward their retirement system contributions for certain months to the state treasury due to a fiscal deficit. The court applied the plain meaning of the term divert in art. V, &sect; 6(2) and found that the prohibition against seizure of funds applied to and included funds appropriated and intended for the system, but not yet deposited therein. The Order violated the Contract Clause because a contractual relationship existed between vested class members and the system. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 135-6(i), (m)-(o), the class had a contractual right to have the system funded in an actuarially sound manner; therefore, the right to such funding was a term included in the retirement contracts. By diverting the funds in an actuarially unsound manner, defendants impaired the class' contractual right in violation of the Contract Clause. A balanced budget could have been achieved in another way. The pension board did not have to impose N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 135-8(f)(3) (2007) penalties because the employers did not default on their obligation to remit contributions.</SPAN></P>

He pleaded no contest to driving while impaired. preserving his right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion. After he was sentenced, defendant orally entered a notice of appeal. The trial court issued a written opinion, and voided defendant's oral notice of appeal because it was entered before a final written order was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a new notice of appeal. The appellate court held that the trooper testified that the primary purpose of the checkpoint was to find motor vehicle law violations, to find all criminal violations, and to check for drivers' license, registration, and insurance violations. The trial court erred in failing to find the actual primary purpose of the checkpoint and whether it was lawful. The trial court's oral and written findings simply recited two of the trooper's stated purposes. The case was remanded for a finding as to the primary purpose. The strength of the State's interest in conducting the checkpoint was not addressed. Without findings as to the second Brown factor, the findings that the checkpoint was reasonable were not supported. The findings on the third Brown prong alone could not support the conclusion that the checkpoint was not an unreasonable detention. The reason for the conclusion the public interest in the checkpoint outweighed the intrusion on defendant's Fourth Amendment interests was not explained. Finally, there was reasonable suspicion to permit the trooper to detain defendant based on the strong odor of alcohol and defendant's red and glassy eyes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court to issue new findings and conclusions regarding the primary programmatic purpose of the checkpoint. If the trial court determined on remand that the State's primary purpose for the checkpoint was lawful, it had to also issue new findings and conclusions regarding the reasonableness of the checkpoint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A panel consisting of three commissioners, reviewed the competent evidence of record, and one commissioner, with another commissioner concurring, signed an opinion and award.

That same day, the North Carolina Office of the Governor issued a letter informing the concurring commissioner that his term as commissioner had expired and his successor had been appointed. The employer contended that, when the opinion and award was filed, the concurring commissioner was not a qualified commissioner; thus, considering the split opinion, the Commission had no majority vote. On appeal, the court found that, when the opinion was filed, the concurring commissioner was not an officer de jure pursuant to N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 128-6 and 128-7 (2007) because his term as commissioner had ended and his successor had been appointed. Therefore, because the commissioner's appointment was void before the opinion and award were entered, and because his concurrence in the opinion and award was not the act of a qualified officer - neither de jure nor de facto - the concurrence was a nullity. The panel was thus evenly split and no majority existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice entered an apartment in search of money and drugs. The apartment belonged to a man's girlfriend, whose mother, brother, and three young children were present. Both defendant and the accomplice forced the girlfriend to engage in sexual intercourse. The mother, brother, and three young children were confined to a bedroom. The man directed defendant and the accomplice to the items. Defendant then shot and killed the man. Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, murder, rape, and kidnapping. The appellate court found that (1) defendant was properly convicted of three rapes, as two occurred when defendant changed positions between them and the third, which the accomplice committed, was chargeable to defendant under an &quot;acting in concert&quot; theory, (2) three kidnapping charges regarding the young children were properly sought pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39 (2007) and the jury was properly instructed on them, as the children were younger than 16 and had been restrained, and (3) the State proved for sentencing purposes that defendant's prior Virginia conviction was substantially similar to a Class A1 or Class 1 misdemeanor in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vacant lot owner owned a vacant lot in the town. The lot was subject to an ordinance regulating development in a Resource Conservation District (RCD). A portion of the property lay within the RCD. The vacant lot owner applied for a building permit to construct a house on part of the property located outside the RCD. The town granted the building permit. However, when construction began, the neighboring property owners successfully enjoined the construction as being in violation of certain restrictive covenants. The vacant lot buyers purchased the lot subject to the adjustment board granting a variance to build within the RCD. Eventually, the adjustment board denied the variance request; the trial court reversed. The appellate court found that the adjustment board properly found that its inquiry was limited to whether the RCD ordinance left the lot with no reasonable use pursuant to Chapel Hill, N.C., Land Use Management Ordinance &sect; 3.6.3(j)(2)(A)(1). It noted that the town had previously granted a building permit to construct a house on the property outside the RCD and, thus, the restrictive covenants could not be used to override the adjustment board's variance decision.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. II, &sect; 23 and seeking a refund of the taxes it paid under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sold fuel to the State. The State required vendors to submit bids online using the E-Procurement website. The winner was charged a marketing fee of the contract amount, which was authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 66-58.12 (2007). The corporation claimed that the fee was unconstitutional. Defendants moved to dismiss the action, arguing that it was barred by sovereign immunity. The court of appeals held that the corporation's claims were barred by the defense of sovereign immunity. Defendants were state agencies and officials sued in their official capacities, and they did not expressly waive sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity was not waived by either the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-253 to 1-267 (2007), or N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 (2007). The North Carolina Supreme Court's holding that sovereign immunity could not prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim alleging a violation of his rights under the Declaration of Rights of the North Carolina Constitution was limited to alleged violations of personal rights and did not extend to the corporation's complaint. N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 23 did not articulate any rights, only procedures to be followed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment suit brought by plaintiffs, parents and a nonprofit association, defendant board of education (BOE) challenged decisions of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) that denied the BOE's N.C. R. Civ. P. 12 motions that alleged a lack of standing and that ruled that the BOE had no statutory authority to convert traditional calendar schools to mandatory year-round schools without the parents' prior consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The BOE approved a plan to operate some schools on a year-round basis after giving the parents an opportunity to select a traditional or year-round track for their children. The court found that the parents had alleged sufficient standing to allow their claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-254 (2007), because they were directly affected by the plan. Because their children could be reassigned to year-round schools in the future, an actual controversy existed, and a declaratory judgment was appropriate to resolve the controversy. The parents did not have to exhaust administrative remedies because their claims did not fall within the scope of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-369 (2007). However, the BOE had authority under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-47(11) to determine the school calendar under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-84.2 (2007), which did not bar year-round schools. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-1 did not provide a right to equal opportunity to attend a school with a traditional calendar. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-366(b), the BOE's decision to assign a student to a year-round school was final subject only to a N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-369 (2007) application for reassignment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the BOE.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) entered a judgment that granted the State's motion to appeal, reinstated a DWI charge against defendant, and remanded the case to the district court for trial after the district court had initially dismissed that charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with DWI. The district court then dismissed his case allegedly because the arresting police officer's arrest affidavit, and affidavit and revocation report, were not properly sworn and notarized since the documents did not state the date on which the notary's commission expired. After a hearing on the State's motion to appeal, the trial court found that the documents contained everything necessary, including the expiration date of the notary's commission. Accordingly, the trial court remanded the case to the district court, but also certified the case for appeal. The appellate court found that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution barred the State's appeal. The appellate court concluded that once the district court dismissed the criminal charge against defendant because the State's evidence was insufficient as a matter of law, double jeopardy barred further prosecution even though the missing expiration date finding appeared to be erroneous. The appellate court added that the double jeopardy principle did not operate to correct errors resulting in a preverdict acquittal, even including an error patently wrong in the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital company was formed as a successor to a hospital which was previously granted a CON. The company's CON application sought to relocate all hospital departments to a new facility in another town and to abandon the existing hospital campus. Applying N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 131E-176(16) and 131E-181(a) (2003), the agency determined that the CON application could not be treated as an amendment to the prior CON. Moreover, because the CON application proposed the relocation of two operating rooms and added a third, the CON application provided a new institutional health service under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 131E-176(16)(u), which required the company to comply with the North Carolina State Medical Facilities Plan under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 131E-176(16)(u) and 131E-183(a) (2003). On appeal, the court found that the agency acted within its authority by treating the application as one for a new institutional health service rather than as a modification to the prior CON. The agency also did not err by concluding that the company failed to carry its burden of demonstrating compliance with the relevant statutory review criteria. Accordingly, the agency did not err by denying the CON application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court, Beaufort County (North Carolina) for one count of possession of marijuana with intent to sell or deliver marijuana within 300 feet of a playground and one count of having attained the status of habitual felon. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the charges in two files because the charges were encompassed in his prior plea arrangement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he was observed selling marijuana. He pled guilty to prior cocaine charges. The plea agreement did not reference a file number associated with the marijuana charges to be dismissed. It was not clear that either the prosecutor or defendant was aware that two separate criminal files had been created. He was indicted for possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana within 300 feet of a playground. The State claimed that it had only agreed to dismiss the marijuana charges in one file and not the marijuana charge in another file. The appellate court held that it appeared that defendant's guilty plea to the cocaine charges may have been induced by misrepresentations made by the State. Given the similarity of the alleged offenses and their close temporal proximity, defendant was entitled to an explanation that the State was only agreeing to dismiss the marijuana charges in one file. The State presented substantial evidence that the recreational facility in question contained at least three separate apparatuses. The State presented substantial evidence that defendant had attained the status of habitual felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court committed no error with regard to the issues of defendant's conviction for trafficking within 1000 feet of a park and his status as a habitual offender. The matter was remanded for the trial court to make additional findings of fact and conclusions of law with regard to the issue of his guilty plea and the dismissal of certain charges.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the law was not a revenue bill and ordered the lottery objectors to pay litigation costs pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-263 (2005). The appellate court found that the law was not a revenue bill because it was not enacted to (1) raise money on the credit of the State, (2) pledge the faith of the State directly or indirectly for the payment of any debt, or (3) impose any tax upon the people of the State, as required under N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 23. It also found no error in the awarding of costs under N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hanover County District Court (North Carolina) entered a judgment that granted defendant owner's motion to dismiss plaintiff city's action against the owner for not meeting an owner-residency requirement related to the owner's garage apartment he had built, declared part of Wilmington, N.C., Land Development Code &sect; 18-285(g) unconstitutional, and declared citations issued against the owner to be void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner applied for a permit to build a garage apartment on his property, he was notified that his property violated the city's land development code.

He was later cited for violating Wilmington, N.C., Land Development Code &sect; 18-285(g). Eventually, at a trial de novo, the trial court declared the part of the ordinance he was charged with violating, requiring owner occupancy, to be unconstitutional. It also voided his citations. The appellate court found (1) that the owner was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing his court challenge to the ordinance, (2) the part of the ordinance requiring owner occupancy was unconstitutional because it impermissibly regulated his lawful ownership of the property rather than use of it, and (3) Wilmington, N.C., Land Development Code &sect; 18-285(g), to the extent of regulating owner occupancy, was beyond the authority of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-383 (2006) to regulate property, as it did not regulate the health, safety, or general welfare of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After officer one stopped defendant, who was riding a bicycle in the vicinity of a breaking and entering, she placed him in investigative detention.

After arresting defendant, the officers found jewelry and tools, including a screwdriver, in defendant's backpack. Affirming the denial of the motion to suppress, the court found that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant based on his proximity to the location of the crime, the time of day, and the absence of other persons in the area. The officers did not unreasonably seize defendant as there had been prior occasions in which defendant had fled. In addition, officer one had probable cause to arrest defendant for possession of burglary tools under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-55 (2005) because her suspicion that defendant possessed implements of housebreaking was supported by (1) defendant's possession of the flashlight; (2) defendant's possession of the backpack containing unknown items; and (3) the factors supporting the finding of reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 116B-51 et seq. (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that the retention of the interest or income on their property by defendants pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 116B-64 (2003) constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The trial court dismissed the claims pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6). On appeal, the court affirmed. Although no United States or North Carolina Supreme Court case had addressed the exact issue, the court noted that cases cited by the owners dealt with property that unquestionably belonged to identified owners. However, the court found that case law from other states interpreting their unclaimed property acts had held that because the owners' action in failing to make any use of the property at issue, rather than the action of the state, caused the lapse of the property right, no taking occurred that required compensation. Pursuant to the Act, the State did not undertake any overt action to take private property from the owners.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to detain defendant after completing a traffic stop, thereby violating is federal and state constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The appellate court concluded that defendant was unreasonably detained and thus, defendant's consent to search was involuntary. When the officer asked the driver if he could speak to defendant, they were not free to leave and thus were detained. The officer did not detect alcohol and found no contraband or weapons, but found the cousin's heart to be beating unusually fast when the officer frisked him. The officer also noticed that the rental car was one day overdue, but testified that he did not find anything unusual about that. The cousin's nervousness, in the context of the circumstances, did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion necessary to justify defendant's further detention, and thus the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court admonished the owners' counsel to include in his brief references to pages in the transcripts, the record on appeal, or exhibits under N.C.

The complaint alleged facts that would put the owners on notice that the property was located in both counties. Any change in the status of the property was made long before the owners purchased the property. Thus, the owners suffered no injury in fact due to the resolution between defendants fixing the county line, and they lacked standing to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts. The request for class certification under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina) denied defendant's motion to dismiss certain charges. Defendant was convicted and sentenced for, inter alia, first degree rape as the principal, first degree rape by acting in concert with someone else, first degree sexual offense by fellatio, first degree sexual offense by anal intercourse, and first degree sexual offense by digital penetration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice robbed a woman, put her in the trunk of her car, drove to an abandoned house, and raped her while the accomplice threatened her with a gun. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-27.2(a)(2)(a) and 14-27.4(a)(2)(a) (2005), the appellate court determined that remand was necessary as to the charges of first degree rape and first degree sexual offense by anal intercourse because (1) defendant sufficiently preserved the denial of his motion to dismiss for appellate review since he was not required to provide specific reasoning to support the motion, (2) his assignment of error was adequate, and (3) the evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable jury to convict defendant of the first degree offenses for which no acting in concert instruction was given since the record contained no evidence showing his personal use or display of a dangerous weapon. Defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge of first degree rape by acting in concert with someone else because the jury instruction referred to guilt both as a principle and by acting in concert, which allowed the jury to convict him twice for the same crime, in violation of his double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the judgments for first degree rape as a principal and first degree sexual offense based on anal intercourse, remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment for second degree rape and second degree sexual offense, ordered a new trial as to the charge of first degree rape by acting in concert with someone else, and found no error regarding defendant's remaining convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

The officer pursued a person who had evaded a checkpoint and come to a stop in a residential driveway. The officer then approached the stopped car and spoke to the occupants. The combination of the driver's evasion of a checkpoint, the odor of alcohol surrounding the driver, and a brief conversation with the driver gave the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver had committed an implied-consent offense. The driver gave no clear indication that she wanted to call an attorney, and therefore the officer was not required to wait for the full 30 minutes under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-16.2(a)(6) (2005), before administering the test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property at issue consisted of 13 acres of waterfront land. Previous litigation had established title to the property in plaintiff. There was no dispute that defendants continued to occupy the land. The contempt finding was based on defendants' testimony and acknowledgment that they were going to continue to occupy the land despite what the trial court had ordered. The court found that defendants failed to preserve most of their errors on appeal by timely challenging the trial court's orders and the orders in the previous litigation. The court further upheld the trial court's finding of contempt and found no error with regard to the trial court's finding of defendants in civil and criminal contempt. The court noted that defendants were found in civil contempt for failing to comply with the trial court's 2004 order not to trespass any longer, and were found in criminal contempt for their testimony threatening to disobey future orders of the court. Thus, defendants were found in civil and criminal contempt on the basis of different acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the habitual DWI statute violated the separation of powers between the branches of government and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch because the district attorney was allowed to exercise discretion in enforcing the law. The appellate court had recently rejected an almost identical argument regarding the Habitual Felon Act. It held that defendant had neither argued nor did any evidence reflect an improper motive by the prosecutor sub judice in the decision regarding the charges upon which defendant was indicted and tried. In addition, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress based on his claim that there was insufficient cause or suspicion to stop his car because defendant's improper tags, standing alone, gave the deputies sufficient cause to stop defendant. Also, the trial court did not err in allowing a deputy to testify as to her opinion that defendant was impaired because there was no dispute that the deputy personally observed defendant and that she based her opinion on those observations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Recognizing that defendant state needed to provide incentives to lure certain types of businesses to the state for its economy to thrive, the General Assembly amended legislation to provide for relevant tax credits. The business received such benefits. The taxpayers sued, inter alia, the business, the county, the state, and defendant city claiming the incentives were unlawful. The trial court found that judicial precedent held that the provision of economic incentives to recruit business to the state involved a proper public purpose, and thus, that the taxpayers lacked standing under the Uniformity of Taxation Clauses, N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(2) and (3), the federal Dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the Public Purpose, N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1),(7), and Exclusive Emoluments, N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 32 clauses to challenge the incentives. On appeal, the appellate court found the taxpayers lacked standing to challenge the incentives under the taxation and commerce clauses for not being able to show prejudice and had standing but failed to show a public purpose was not involved regarding the Public Purpose and Exclusive Emoluments clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that she had standing to challenge a checkpoint's constitutionality. The appellate court agreed. A reasonable person, at 2:30 a.m., would not feel free to leave upon being approached as defendant was by a uniformed officer whose patrol car's blue lights were activated behind him. Defendant submitted to the officer's show of authority. Defendant was seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when she stopped walking toward the apartment in response to the officer's request. The officer stopped defendant pursuant to the checkpoint plan, not in light of the totality of the circumstances. The officer testified that his job as the checkpoint's chase vehicle officer was to conduct investigatory stops of anyone who turned around. He pointed to no specific and articulable facts other than defendant's turn that warranted his stop. He did not stop her because she turned across the center turn lane, because of how she drove down the street, or because of the manner in which she exited her vehicle. He stopped her based on the systematic plan of the checkpoint. Defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the plan by which she was &quot;snared.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice broke into a woman's home and stabbed her son multiple times with a knife, causing him serious injury. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to submit the aggravating factors to the jury via a special verdict form and imposing an enhanced sentenced based on an aggravating factor. The court held that the trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial when it submitted the aggravating factors to the jury by means of a special verdict and that, to the contrary, the trial court was scrupulously protecting defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial, exactly as Blakely required. The court agreed that the trial court erred in allowing the State to reference the testimony of the mother during closing argument and by calling the mother a second victim of the crime since it was victim impact evidence. However, because of the considerable evidence of defendant's guilt, the admission was not prejudicial error. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on felonious breaking or entering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender was a registered sex offender, who had suffered a stroke and never travelled without his mother. The ordinance prohibited registered sex offenders from knowingly entering any public park owned and operated by the town.

The right to enter parks was not encompassed by either the fundamental right of travel or the right to intrastate travel. The ordinance did not infringe upon the offender's right to intrastate travel as it did not impair his daily functions. The ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate government interest and did not violate the offender's substantive due process rights. The intended purpose of the ordinance was to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the park system for the town's citizens, and to promote the general welfare and safety of the town. The ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The ordinance did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause as it was not punitive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board denied the teacher's request for an evidentiary hearing before that board. The appellate court held N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-325(m)(2), stating probationary teachers' rights, did not expressly provide a right to a hearing before the board. The procedure for career teachers in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-325(h)-(j3) only applied to probationary teachers dismissed during the school year. A reasonable construction of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-325(o) was that the board only had to notify the teacher of its decision not to renew her contract once that decision was made, before June 15. Based on the plain language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-325(m) and (n), it did not entitle the teacher to an evidentiary hearing before the board. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-45 did not entitle the teacher to a hearing before the board because it did not apply to review of a decision of a county board of education. The trial court properly struck exhibits the teacher tried to offer because its review was limited to the record before the board.

Plaintiff argued that because he was not convicted of a violent felony and his conviction was so far in the past, over 20 years ago, the statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed noting that the statutory scheme treated all felons the same and served to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of North Carolina. The appellate court also concluded that the challenged statute did not violate the Ex Post Facto clauses of the U.S. and North Carolina constitutions because &sect; 14-415.1 was a non-punitive, regulatory scheme. Next, the appellate court concluded that &sect;&nbsp;14-415.1 did not amount to an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder, as nothing indicated that the statute was enacted as a form of retroactive punishment. Because plaintiff's right to possess firearms was not a vested right, the subject statute did not violate plaintiff's right to due process, equal protection, or to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

There was no merit to plaintiff's argument that noncustodial versus custodial parents were a suspect class for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. As for procedural due process, plaintiff had been given the opportunity to exercise his rights and had in fact done so during a two-day hearing. There was no substantive due process violation. The state had a compelling interest in regulating child support obligations, and through establishing a rebuttable presumption with regard to the guidelines under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-13.4(c) (2005), the act was narrowly drawn. Next, based on the financial affidavit plaintiff submitted to the trial court, the court found no error in the findings of fact regarding the children's expenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine and defendant subsequently admitted his habitual felon status. The Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced defendant as a prior record level VI offender to 135 months to 171 months imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to establish that the crime alleged occurred in the State of North Carolina. Among other things, testimony by a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer and forensic chemist provided sufficient circumstantial evidence. The appellate court also concluded that the trial court did not commit plain error in allowing an officer to testify that the substance seized was crack cocaine because, inter alia, the officer had been in contact with crack cocaine between 500 and 1000 times, and the testimony was helpful for a clear understanding of his overall testimony and the facts surrounding defendant's arrest. The officer's testimony that defendant provided fake names and possessed a fictitious identification card was admissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b) (2005), because it was probative of defendant's guilty knowledge and established the chain of circumstances culminating in the arrest. Finally, the appellate court held that an interested witness instruction was not justified and that the jury instructions did not unconstitutionally lower the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs homeowners sued defendant homeowners' association in the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) for fining the homeowners. The association filed a counterclaim for the fines. The trial court granted the association's motion for summary judgment and a mandatory injunction and denied the homeowners' summary judgment motion. The homeowners appealed and the association cross-appealed from the denial of its request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners said the association was not properly formed. The appellate court held they were estopped from claiming this because they had accepted the association's validity. They said retroactively applying N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 47F-3-102(12) (2005) and 47F-3-107.1 (2005) of the Planned Community Act (Act), N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 47F, to them violated the contract clause in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, but it did not disturb a vested right, impair a binding contract or create a new obligation, as it only provided another enforcement remedy, and the Act facilitated the parties' intent by solidifying the importance of restrictive covenants. The homeowners' substantive due process rights were not violated because the statutes were rationally related to the Act's legitimate purpose of providing a framework to deal with real estate developments. The association's procedure did not violate the homeowners' procedural due process rights because they had notice, an opportunity to be heard and present evidence, and notice of the decision. The association's cross-appeal was dismissed because it did not file a notice of its cross-appeal with the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed, and the association's cross-appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner granddaughter sued respondent owner, seeking access to the owner's property to restore, maintain, and visit the grave sites of her grandparents, and other relatives, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-75 (2005). The Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) initially granted the petition. Later, the trial court allowed the owner to amend his answer, and ruled that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-75 was unconstitutional. The granddaughter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The granddaughter argued on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the owner's motion to amend after the hearing on the merits and erred in granting the owner's untimely motion under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The appellate court found that it was clear that the trial on the merits had concluded where the trial court announced the ruling granting the relief sought by the granddaughter. Even though the trial court had not entered a written judgment, a judgment had been rendered in favor of the granddaughter and the trial on the merits had concluded. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was not properly asserted after trial. Allowing the motion to amend was an abuse of discretion and caused undue prejudice to the granddaughter. In any event, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-74 was a proper exercise of a police power and therefore not subject to the constitutional and fundamental provision that private property was not to be taken for a public use without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of an order consistent with the oral order rendered by the trial court at the close of the hearing on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voters sued defendant North Carolina State Board of Elections and Attorney General, alleging that the judicial districting plan for superior court in the county, as established by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-41 (2004), violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina) held that the judicial districts were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On an issue of first impression, the appellate court concluded that the one person, one vote principle of N.C.

IV, &sect; 9(1), allowed the legislature to divide the state into a convenient number of superior court judicial districts. The constitutional provisions governing the election of state senators and representatives, N.C. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 3(1) and 5(1), had a population proportionality requirement. The distinction between the provisions evidenced an intent not to require population proportionality in state judicial elections.

R. Civ. P. 803(8), where it was prepared pursuant to a statutory duty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant television station appealed from an order of the Beaufort County Superior Court (North Carolina), which prohibited the parties and their attorneys from communicating with the media during civil litigation between  plaintiff county school board (board) and defendant county board of commissioners (commissioners). The station had filed a motion for right of access under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-72.1, but the trial court did not decide the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's complaint alleged that the commissioners deliberately underfunded the public school system in the budget ordinance in retaliation against the board for its refusal to capitulate to funding threats made by various commissioners. The trial court dissolved the gag order after the matter had been submitted to the jury. On appeal, the court found that although the station's claim was moot, it was capable of repetition, yet evading review. The gag order wholly failed to meet any of the standards under the First Amendment or set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-72.1. The trial court failed to enter any findings of fact of the existence of a clear threat to the fairness of the trial, that such threat was posed by the actual publicity to be restrained, and that it considered less restrictive alternatives. The trial court erred in orally rendering the gag order and in not entering a written order containing the required findings on the motion prior to proceeding with the trial. However, the gag order prohibited either party or their attorneys from talking to the press; it did not deny the station access to the trial or to court records as provided by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-72.1(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment motion was properly before the trial court where the trial court had ordered a mistrial and thus, the case subsequent to the mistrial was unaffected by the rulings made during the trial, including the trial court's previous denial of the clerk's motion for a directed verdict. The trial court properly granted the clerk summary judgment on the First Amendment claim because political affiliation was an appropriate requirement for deputy clerks of superior court. Deputy clerks served at the pleasure of and were appointed by an elected official, they performed acts on the clerk's behalf, and the clerk was responsible for the acts of the deputies. The deputy clerks also served as the public face of the clerk's office. The appellate court declined to hold that the former deputy clerks had broader rights under the North Carolina Constitution, especially since the legislature had explicitly stated by statute that deputy clerks served at the pleasure of the clerk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss. The appellate court disagreed. The general assembly had prescribed two avenues by which a taxpayer may have appealed from an administrative assessment of taxes: N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 (2005) and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-241.1 to -241.4 (2005). Petitioner opted to use N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-241.1 to -241.4 to contest the tax assessment at issue. Petitioner argued that, while North Carolina's pre-payment jurisdiction requirements were arguably constitutionally permissible as to those taxpayer individuals who had the ability to pre-pay the taxes at issue, the pre-payment requirements were not constitutionally permissible as to those taxpayer individuals who did not have the ability to pre-pay the taxes at issue. The appellate court found that the powerful presumption of constitutionality of legislation was sufficient to withstand the accusation that the statute was unconstitutional as to taxpayers who were not able to afford to pay their taxes. The prepayment requirement of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-241.3 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an auto accident in which one person was killed and four people were seriously injured. The evidence showed that defendant was operating his vehicle under the influence of diethyl ether at the time of the accident. Defendant challenged his sentence and his conviction for second degree murder. On appeal, the court found that (1) defendant's aggravated sentence for second degree murder was proper because the trial court submitted the aggravating factors to the jury by way of a special verdict; (2) defendant was not subjected to an ex post facto law, in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect;&nbsp;10 and N.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16, for the second degree murder because the trial court had the authority to use a special verdict at the time of defendant's trial; (3) there was no violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16(d) (2002) because the prosecution was required to prove facts for the aggravated sentences for the crimes in addition to the elements of the crimes; and (4) even if the jury instruction was erroneous, it could not have been concluded that the jury would have reached a different result because the evidence against defendant was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pedestrian sued defendants city and officer, asserting ordinary and gross negligence arising from a accident in which a police car struck the pedestrian. The pedestrian also asserted claims for obstruction of public justice and spoliation of evidence. Earlier, the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed the dismissal of the gross negligence claim, and remanded for consideration of the other claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied a motion filed by the city and the officer seeking summary judgment on the obstruction of justice claim. The appellate court found that this was proper. The evidence would have allowed a jury to conclude that a camera in the officer's police car had made a videotape recording of the accident, and that the videotape was subsequently misplaced or destroyed. However, the trial court should have granted the summary judgment motion filed by the city and the officer on the pedestrian's claim that the city violated her rights under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 by their assertion of the defense of governmental immunity to the pedestrian's first two claims. The core of the pedestrian's argument was her allegation that the city had a policy or practice of &quot;waiving&quot; sovereign immunity in some cases but not in others. The pedestrian failed to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on this claim. The uncontradicted record evidence established that claims against the city were never denied on the basis of sovereign immunity, and that claims were paid or denied on the basis of their legal merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court orders relating to the gross negligence claim, dismissing the claim alleging ordinary negligence, and denying the city's and the officer's summary judgment on the claim of obstruction of public justice were affirmed. The trial court's order was reversed to the extent it denied the city's and the officer's motions for summary judgment on the constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executrix sued defendant doctor, alleging that the executrix's decedent died as a result of the doctor's medical malpractice. After the doctor moved for summary judgment, the executrix voluntarily dismissed the action. Later, the executrix re-filed the action. The Superior Court, Avery County (North Carolina), granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor. The executrix appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original complaint contained the required N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1 N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) expert certification. However, the executrix later admitted in discovery that she had not consulted with her expert until nearly seven months after the filing of her complaint. Thereafter, the executrix dismissed her action under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1 N.C. R. Civ. P. 41(a) and re-filed the action nearly a year after that dismissal, well beyond two years after the alleged malpractice. The executrix first argued that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment because her voluntary dismissal tolled the statute of limitations even though she admitted in discovery that the expert was consulted after the filing of the original complaint. The appellate court disagreed. Because the executrix admitted that the allegation in the complaint was ineffective to meet the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1 N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j), a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, which ordinarily would have allowed for another year for refiling, was unavailable to her in this case. The factual record necessary for a constitutional inquiry as to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1 N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) was lacking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff news organization challenged defendant Governor's decision to withhold certain clemency records requested under the North Carolina Public Records Law, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 131-1 et seq. (2005). The Governor moved to dismiss the complaint under both N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6). The Wake County Superior Court, North Carolina, denied the motion under Rule 12(b)(1), but granted the motion under Rule 12(b)(6). Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Resolving the issues raised in the complaint required the appellate court to exercise its fundamental responsibility to determine N.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 5(6)'s proper meaning concerning the Governor's clemency powers. The case did not raise a political question, but only required a determination as to where to draw the line between the Executive Branch and the General Assembly with respect to clemency, given the separation of powers doctrine. Because the controversy was governed by N.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 5's meaning, the appellate court had the authority to resolve the dispute and thus rejected the challenge to its subject matter jurisdiction. N.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 5(6) carved out a limited area in which the General Assembly could exercise its authority with respect to clemency and required the legislation to specifically relate to the manner of applying for pardons. The Public Records Law did not specifically reference clemency and thus was not permitted to intrude upon the Governor's clemency authority. The news organization, then, was precluded from using the statute to compel the Governor to disclose the requested documents, and so the complaint failed to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police officer observed defendant driving his vehicle erratically, the officer stopped defendant's vehicle. When defendant stepped out of the vehicle, the officer noticed that defendant had red, glassy eyes and a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. The officer formed the opinion that defendant's mental and physical faculties were impaired by alcohol. After defendant was taken to a police station, defendant's alcohol breath-test resulted in a breath-alcohol concentration of .16. Defendant was then indicted for habitual impaired driving. Following a trial, defendant was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced as a prior offender. On appeal, the appellate court found that the habitual impaired driving offense did not violate defendant's right to be free of double jeopardy since the statute increased the punishment for the offense being prosecuted and did not punish a prior crime a second time. It also found that the jury was properly instructed even though the jury verdict sheet did not specify which of the two definitions of impaired driving applied, as the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of the single offense of impaired driving.</SPAN></P>

He was found guilty of malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault. Eventually, he was found guilty by a jury of being a habitual felon. Defendant was then sentenced. On appeal, he contended that his conviction for habitual misdemeanor assault and under the habitual felon statute violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy. Specifically, he argued that Apprendi and Blakely eliminated sentence-enhancement statutes, rendering all recidivist statutes substantive crimes with the result, according to defendant, that sentencing for either habitual misdemeanor assault or as a habitual felon violated the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense. The appellate court found that his claim had already been considered and rejected. It explained that Apprendi and Blakely applied the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial to sentence enhancements whereas his double jeopardy claim arose under the Fifth Amendment, which made Apprendi and Blakely inapplicable to his claim.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 11-2, referred to the Christian Bible and other religious texts, or, alternatively, a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether either plaintiff had presented a justiciable controversy in the complaint. Although it was unnecessary that plaintiffs had an actual right of action against the State to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of an actual controversy, litigation had to appear unavoidable. Litigation between the individual and the State was unavoidable where her request to swear on the Quran when she appeared as a witness was denied, she chose to affirm to tell the truth, and she then sought a declaratory judgment. Moreover, the State had clearly demonstrated its intent to continue the court of action by its refusal to permit witnesses to swear on any text other than the Christian Bible, and the facts did not suggest any impediment to litigation. There was also no impediment to litigation between the organization and the State where the organization showed that its Jewish members intended to avail themselves of their rights to serve as jurors or witnesses if called and the organization had manifested an intent to litigate the issue by filing suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six counts of first-degree sexual offense of a child under the age of 13 years and the Superior Court, Cabarrus County (North Carolina), sentenced defendant to three consecutive sentences of a minimum of 288 months and a maximum of 355 months in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant relocated to North Carolina with another woman and her children. They lived with the woman's sister and her children. Defendant was unemployed so he stayed home and watched the children. The sister became suspicious of abuse and took her child to the Children's Advocacy Center. The child and the other children stated that defendant abused them. The appellate court found that there was no violation of defendant's right to confrontation because the victims took the stand and were available for cross-examination. Admission of videotape interviews was permissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803(4) because the challenged statements were made to pediatric nurses at the children's center prior to examination by the doctor. The court properly instructed the jury that the expert testimony was admitted solely for the purpose of corroboration and not as substantive evidence and they could not convict defendant solely on this opinion testimony. It was not error to find the children competent to testify. There was no evidence to support a finding of attempted sexual offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Guilford County Superior Court, North Carolina, entered judgments convicting defendant of conspiracy to traffic by possessing 100 or more but less than 500 doses of methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and to the sale of a Schedule I substance, MDA. After sentencing, defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress, the appellate court declined to address the issue due to the numerous violations of its appellate rules and dismissed the assignment of error. Defendant also challenged the trial court's decision allowing a detective to testify concerning his ongoing investigation of defendant prior to his arrest, contending that the testimony should have been excluded under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 403 (2005). However, defendant failed to properly object to the proffered testimony, and therefore appellate review was for plain error only under N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1) and (c)(4) (2006). But because defendant did not specifically and distinctly allege plain error, he was not entitled to plain error review of the issue. Finally, because defendant failed to provide the appellate court a copy of an audiotape played to the jury by the State or the accompanying transcript as required under N.C. R. App. P. 9(d)(2) (2006), the record was insufficient for the appellate court to determine whether the evidence was prejudicial, as defendant contended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from complaints about excessive noise from a club. Defendants argued that the ordinance at issue was overbroad, but the appellate court disagreed. The ordinance was narrow, prohibiting sound amplification only at certain levels and at certain times, and thus the ordinance was not over-broad. Defendants also argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it allowed the &quot;the County&quot; to issue special event permits in its discretion with no articulated standards, acting as an arbitrary prior restraint on free speech. The appellate court agreed. Although the ordinance was narrowly drawn, it was constitutionally flawed in that it allowed the county to exercise its discretion to issue a complete exemption in the form of a special events permit, while prescribing no standards for the exercise of that discretion. The paragraph of the ordinance establishing prohibitions and exemptions was an impermissible prior restraint, which violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Because the paragraph of the ordinance under which these defendants were convicted was unconstitutional, it could not have been the basis for their convictions.</SPAN></P>

After defendant again was found guilty of misdemeanor assault on a female, based on his admission to the prior assaults, he was convicted under the habitual misdemeanor assault statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat.  14-33.2 (2005). Defendant argued that the Apprendi line of cases prohibited the use of &quot;sentence enhancers&quot; and that as a result, the crime of habitual misdemeanor assault was barred by the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy. The appellate court held that Apprendi and Blakely applied the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial to sentence enhancements. Defendant's argument, however, was directed at the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy, and accordingly, Apprendi and Blakely were inapposite. Recidivist statutes, or repeat-offender statutes, survived double jeopardy challenges because they increased the severity of the punishment for the crime being prosecuted; they did not punish a previous crime a second time. The appellate court declined to extend the holdings in Apprendi and Blakely to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-33.2 (2005).</SPAN></P>

The trial court certified a class and appointed the named plaintiffs as class representatives. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers said the State impermissibly taxed interest on municipal bonds issued by non-North Carolina state and local governments, while not taxing such interest on bonds issued by North Carolina state and local governments. The appellate court held the class certification was an appealable interlocutory order because, if an appeal was not allowed, the State's rights would be adversely affected. All class members met N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267's (2003) requirement to individually demand a tax refund when named taxpayers made a demand. The purpose of &sect; 105-267 was achieved, as the State had notice of all class members' claims. The named taxpayers could contest the tax for corporations and estates and trusts. Each group contested an adjustment to its taxable income under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-134.6(b)(1)b and 105-134.6(c)(1), alleging the same law was unconstitutional, so the named taxpayers had more than a technical or official interest in the subject matter of the suit affecting corporations or estates and trusts.

The appeals court found that although a search warrant affidavit did not include any indication, other than the amount of blood, that would suggest a search of defendant's computer would lead to information regarding a potential homicide, and the affidavit only included a wholly conclusory statement that the affiant had probable cause to search the computers in defendant's house, the State met its burden; the evidence and testimony admitted at trial pursuant to the warrant did not prejudice defendant pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV in light of other properly admitted evidence. This same evidence was presented through numerous other sources. The admission of evidence pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b) (2005) regarding an individual close to defendant who seventeen years prior to the wife's death was found dead at the bottom of a set of stairs was proper. Evidence of the individual's death was probative of defendant's intent, knowledge, and the absence of accident in the victim's death, and the trial court found the evidence to be relevant, with seventeen similarities between the individual's death and that of the wife's.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alamance County District Court (North Carolina) adjudicated respondent, a juvenile, delinquent for committing two counts of crime against nature, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-177 (2005). The trial court also entered a juvenile disposition order, placing respondent on six months' of unsupervised probation and ordering that respondent have no contact with his victim. Respondent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of an incident in which respondent's partner age 11 at the time, performed oral sex on respondent who was approximately age 14 at the time. On appeal, respondent argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-177 (2005) was unconstitutional as applied in his case because the legislature could not have intended to criminalize non-procreative consensual relations between minors less than three years apart in age, while failing to criminalize procreative relations between the same minors. The appellate court disagreed. The appellate court rejected respondent's suggestion that it graft age requirements into &sect; 14-177 which the general assembly had not seen fit to enact. Application of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-177 (2005) was permissible when the conduct involved minors, public conduct, prostitution, or non-consensual, coercive conduct. Even if respondent and his partner had been adults, respondent still would have been in violation of the statute. It was undisputed that the conduct occurred in a car parked in a bowling alley parking lot, and was thus public conduct. The statute remained applicable where public conduct was involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed a complaint against defendant husband, seeking a divorce and ancillary relief. The wife's complaint also sought to rescind the parties' prior collaborative agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that both the Uniform Arbitration Act, former N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-567.1 to 1-567.29 (2001) (repealed 2003), and the Family Law Arbitration Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50-41 to 50-63 (2005) were unconstitutional as applied to the wife's actions for fraudulent inducement and breach of the collaborative agreement. The appellate court ruled that enforcement of arbitration agreements did not violate the constitutional right to a jury trial. The trial court relied exclusively on the fact that causes of action for fraudulent inducement and breach of contract existed when the 1868 Constitution was adopted. It never addressed if &quot;the remedy sought&quot; was one &quot;respecting property.&quot; The wife, on appeal, made no argument that the remedy or relief sought met that requirement. She identified no property right that would have been vindicated if the collaborative agreement was rescinded. Because the fact questions regarding if an enforceable arbitration agreement existed did not relate to the ultimate relief sought, and did not affect the final rights of the parties with respect to their dispute, the wife was not entitled to have those issues resolved by a jury.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence about defendant's possession of an assault rifle was relevant, partly to establish that defendant shot the victim because he did not want him to discover that defendant was violating probation by possessing firearms. Thus, admission of the evidence was proper under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 401 and 403 (2005). The testimony about a pistol was irrelevant because the pistol was not connected to the shooting. The error was harmless under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1443(a) (2005), however, as there was overwhelming evidence of guilt. Defendant admitted that he shot the victim because he knew he was not supposed to possess guns and did not want to return to jail. Next, evidence admitted under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b) (2005) was relevant to refute defendant's contention that he shot the victim without premeditation and deliberation and to show the circumstances leading up to the murder. Finally, by asking his probation officer about information in her file, defendant opened the door for the State to elicit hearsay testimony to explain and rebut evidence about the file.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) for possession of a firearm by a felon. Defendant argued that the indictments charging him with that offense and as attaining the status of a habitual felon unconstitutionally subjected him to double jeopardy by &quot;double-counting&quot; a prior controlled substances conviction and a prior conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer pulled defendant's car over. The officer arrested defendant and placed him in the rear of the patrol car. When the officer returned to defendant's car, he noticed a handgun in the grass about a foot away from the front passenger door. The appellate court held that by possessing a firearm, defendant committed a fresh violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-288.8(c) from his earlier conviction, and his punishment for that new crime could not reasonably be said to re-punish the earlier offense. Rather, it only punished him for the new violation. Accordingly, the mere reliance on the earlier conviction to establish that defendant was a recidivist for sentencing purposes did not implicate double jeopardy concerns. The appellate court therefore rejected defendant's argument that he had been subjected to double jeopardy with respect to his earlier possession of a firearm by a felon conviction. The &quot;double-counting&quot; alleged by defendant in his arguments failed to implicate &quot;double jeopardy&quot; as defendant had not been re-prosecuted or re-punished for either of his earlier convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their complaint, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 105-164.4(a)(6) on grounds that it violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, denied them equal protection of the laws, and violated the uniform taxation rule of N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2. Section 105-164.4(a)(6) imposed a five percent sales tax on satellite companies, but did not impose a sales tax on cable companies. The court held that the tax statute did not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because when the differential tax treatment of two categories of companies resulted solely from differences between the nature of their businesses, and not from the location of their activities, the tax was not discriminatory.

The superior court granted a motion by third-party respondent university to intervene, found that the owner had standing to present the appeal, and dismissed his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university filed a request to close part of the road. After three public hearings, the council found that the closing would not be contrary to the public interest and would not deprive anyone owning property in the vicinity of reasonable means of ingress and egress. The owner challenged the order in the superior court. The appellate court affirmed the superior court's order. The superior court properly refused to conduct an evidentiary hearing because under the clear and unambiguous language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-299(b) (2005), all evidence was to be presented to the council except as to whether the council complied with procedural requirements, and the record evidence supported the council's findings. The owner's assignment of error challenging the denial of his motion to continue did not mention its constitutional basis and was insufficient to preserve the issue for review. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-299 (2005) did not violate the Separation of Powers Clause of the North Carolina Constitution or deprive the owner of a fair hearing because he had an opportunity to test, rebut, and explain the evidence presented to the council at its public hearings on the road closure.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 20-138.5 (2005), and driving with a revoked license under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-28(a) (2005).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress as the police lacked reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop defendant. The appellate court concluded that the totality of the circumstances justified the officer's pursuing and stopping defendant's vehicle to inquire as to why defendant turned away before the checkpoint. In addition to the fact of defendant's legal turn immediately prior to the checkpoint, the following facts combined to allow the officer to make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether defendant was trying to evade the checkpoint: (1) the late hour; (2) the sudden braking of the truck when defendant crested the hill and could see the checkpoint, to the point that the headlights dipped as the front of the truck drove towards the street; (3) the abruptness of defendant's turn into the nearest apartment parking lot; and (4) defendant's behavior in first backing the truck into one space, pulling out and proceeding towards the parking lot exit, and then re-parking when he spotted the patrol car approaching him. The appellate court further concluded that the superior court had jurisdiction because habitual DWI was a substantive offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legal malpractice claim involved the attorney's actions in a medical malpractice suit in which he had represented plaintiffs. Plaintiffs alleged that he had failed to procure expert witnesses who could testify pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 702(c). The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on the grounds that in their legal malpractice complaint, plaintiffs had not alleged with specificity that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j), the medical care had been reviewed by a person qualified as an expert witness who was willing to testify to a deviation from the applicable standard of care. The court held that this was error. Rule 9(j) clearly and unambiguously applied only to any complaint alleging medical malpractice by a health care provider. Nothing in Rule 9(j) required any special pleading for a complaint alleging legal malpractice against an attorney. In their legal malpractice case, to establish their &quot;case within a case,&quot; plaintiffs were required only to proffer sufficient evidence to the jury tending to show the alleged negligence of the health care provider.</SPAN></P>

Defendant next argued that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing a guidance counselor to testify that she believed the victim's account of the rape. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the guidance counselor testified in the context of her role as a guidance counselor who suspected a child had been abused and that the statement was only admitted for the purpose of corroboration. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the State to impeach defendant regarding defendant's false statements about an offense which had been the subject of a deferred prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-300.1(c) (2005), the city passed an ordinance to enforce N.C. Gen.

The board contended that it was entitled under N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 to the proceeds derived from the fines that were assessed under the city's red light camera program. On appeal, the court found that (1) N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 applied to the civil penalties assessed by the city under the city's red light camera ordinance; (2) the superior court did not err by using N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-437 (2005) to determine the amount of the clear proceeds earned by the city's red light camera program; and (3) the superior court correctly applied &sect; 115C-437 to determine that the city was to pay 90 percent of the amount collected by its red light camera program to the board. However, the superior court erred by ordering the city to pay postjudgment interest under N.C. Gen.

The appellate court concluded that the statement was not obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional rights. Defendant was permissibly in jail based on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;122C-303, and there was no Sixth Amendment violation merely because defendant was not afforded the &quot;guiding hand of counsel&quot; prior to the phone call. The appellate court also concluded that there was no evidence that the State deliberately elicited incriminating statements from defendant. Next, the appellate court concluded that because defendant's initial seizure and incarceration were not unconstitutional, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from defendant's person. The appellate court further concluded that the evidence, including a history of violence and hostility between the parties and testimony from defendant's girlfriend that she thought defendant was going to shoot the victim, was sufficient to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs requested attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-19.1 (2005), and the private attorney general doctrine. The intermediate court, sua sponte, raised a defect in the notice of appeal, which designated the state's highest court as &quot;the court to which appeal (was) taken.&quot; The error did not deprive the intermediate court of jurisdiction as the intent to appeal to the intermediate court could be fairly inferred from the notice of appeal and the notice achieved the functional equivalent of such an appeal. Defendants were not misled by the mistake and errors in notices of appeal had been overlooked in other cases. Neither N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-19.1 (2005) nor 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 authorized an award of attorneys' fees. In the absence of statutory authority, attorneys' fees were not allowable as part of court costs. Bailey was distinguished as there was no common fund resulting from the litigation and Bailey involved a class action in which the attorneys' fees borne by the class representatives were shared or equally distributed to the class from the recovery. Plaintiffs sought to shift the burden of attorneys' fees to the State, instead of to a resulting fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered Alford pleas on two counts of armed robbery and one count of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. The Washington County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced him to 25 years in prison for each robbery charge and five years for the assault charge. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 55 years in prison. Defendant filed an appeal as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by increasing his sentences beyond the prescribed statutory maximum in violation of Blakely. The appellate court held that it did not reach the issue of whether a Blakely violation occurred. Defendant was indicted as of the certification date of the Allen opinion, his appeal was not pending direct review, and his case was final. Defendant did not appeal the trial court's acceptance of the plea agreement, the finding of aggravating and mitigating factors by the trial court, nor his sentence. The appellate court allowed a limited review of only those issues within defendant's appeal of right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1444(a1) and (a2). However, it was error to find that $ 1,300.00 and $ 700.00 constituted property of &quot;great monetary value&quot; within the aggravating factor list, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16. Therefore, the trial court's finding of the aggravating factor that the offense involved the actual taking of property of great monetary value was not supported by the evidence, and defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing. Finally, the victim's medical expenses were properly found to be excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the trial court's judgment which found that the amount of money taken constituted great monetary value within the aggravating factor list was reversed and the cause was remanded for resentencing in that respect. The judgment of the trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Johnston County Superior Court (North Carolina) granted judgment in favor of defendants on all claims. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was driving her parents' car when a traffic control gate owned by the Board swung closed, struck the vehicle, and injured her. The Board paid for property damage but refused to pay medical expenses or other compensation. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred by granting defendants' motions for summary judgment regarding the non-constitutional claims. The Board argued that summary judgment was proper because the insurance policy excluded coverage for claims arising out of incidents involving automobiles. The appellate court concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate because the forecast of evidence left no material dispute over the fact that the injuries did not &quot;arise out of&quot; the use of an automobile; the malfunctioning of the gate could have occurred even if the injured party had not been driving a car. As for plaintiffs' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the appellate court first concluded that the Board was a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of &sect;&nbsp;1983. In addition, judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate since there were issues of material fact as to whether the Board applied a reasonable criteria to its evaluation of the claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a refund action, claiming entitlement to the benefits of a &quot;special tax allocation formula&quot; under two North Carolina Tax Review Board orders and a subsequently-enacted corporate tax incentive formula in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-130.4(i) (1989). The Superior Court, Wake County, North Carolina, granted defendant North Carolina Secretary of Revenue summary judgment with a partial refund to the taxpayer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The augmented North Carolina Tax Review Board entered two orders authorizing the taxpayer, a multi-state corporation, to determine the percentage of its income apportioned to North Carolina by taking the &quot;arithmetical average&quot; of the property, payroll and sales factors. Order 350 modified property and payroll factors for six years; Order 351 indefinitely modified the property factor. Later, the statutory formula for allocating a multi-state corporation's total taxable income was amended by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-130.4(i) (1989). The taxpayer determined its tax liability by using the amended statutory formula (double-weighting the sales factor and dividing the total of all factors by four) as well as its reduced property factor authorized under Orders 350 and 351. The state department of revenue advised the taxpayer it could not use the 1989 Amendment to calculate its taxes; this suit followed. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the formula set forth in those Orders was independent from and substituted &sect; 105-130.4(i)'s otherwise applicable statutory allocation formula. And having benefited from the Orders, the taxpayer could not challenge their constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

He also challenged the counting of provisional ballots by voters who did not reside in the precincts where the ballots were cast. After a certificate of election was issued, the candidate filed an appeal under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-182.14. The superior court abated the election protest after 2005 N.C. Sess. Laws 3 was enacted, which provided that election contests for certain offices were heard by the North Carolina General Assembly. Thereafter, the candidate sought review. In dismissing the appeal, the appellate court determined that the controversy was moot. A decision in favor of the candidate would not have permitted him to receive the relief he was seeking. The declaration of the election contained in a certificate of election settled prima facie the right of the person so elected. There was no statutory authority for the North Carolina Board of Elections to revoke the certificate. Alternatively, the appellate court found that the candidate's brief was in violation of N.C. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractors brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant village, challenging the legality of the village's permit fee schedule for the use of internal combustion engine vehicles. The Brunswick County Superior Court (North Carolina) dismissed the contractors' Commerce Clause claim, and later entered summary judgment for the village on the remaining claims. The contractors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village was an island community. The contractors argued that since the fees collected by the village exceeded the &quot;cost of enforcement&quot; and subsidized the maintenance and building of roads, they were a &quot;tax&quot; because the money raised conferred a public benefit. The appellate court found that, as the fees were based on a vehicle's weight and width, and on the duration of the permit, they were squarely within the legislative grant of power to assess fees based on criteria that bore upon the village's costs. Further, 2002 N.C. Sess. Laws 129, &sect;10.1 explicitly stated that the fees were to have been used to finance &quot;the establishment and maintenance&quot; of the village's roads. Accordingly, the village did not exceed its statutory authority. The contractors failed to specify which constitutional provisions the ordinance allegedly violated. To the extent that the contractors might have been presenting a Commerce Clause argument, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review such an argument, as that claim was dismissed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(c) and the contractors did not appeal from that order nor assign error to the dismissal of this claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1997, the applicant filed plans with the Department for development of 21 assisted living facilities. Shortly thereafter, the legislature passed a moratorium with regard to assisted living centers. The Department and applicant engaged in litigation to determine whether the applicant's projects were exempt from the moratorium. The Department and the applicant settled, under which the applicant was granted the unconditional right to develop 19 projects. 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 234 caused the moratorium to expire on December 31, 2001. After that date, all assisted living facilities were to be subject to a certificate of need law. 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 234 imposed certain financing and construction deadlines on its exempt projects. Contrary to the Department's claims, the applicant's settlement projects were not subject to the 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 234 deadlines. Under the settlement, the applicant was given the right to develop the settlement projects without obtaining an exemption from the moratorium. The exemptions applied only to the moratorium. The moratorium was inapplicable to the applicant under the settlement. Thus, the applicant was not bound by 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 234.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) denied petitioner hospital's (applicant) application for a Certificate of Need (CON) to build a complete replacement hospital in Lillington, rather than Erwin, North Carolina. The applicant and petitioner town appealed. The DHHS and respondent, a second hospital, moved to dismiss based upon the 2003 CON application being mooted by the applicant's 2005 CON application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 2005 CON application was based upon the North Carolina Governor's amendment of the 2005 State Medical Facilities Plan (SFMP). The amendment stated that there was a need for a new hospital in Harnett County, North Carolina, for a hospital with no more than 50 acute care beds and three operating rooms. The 2005 CON application was for a new hospital containing 46 acute care beds and three operating rooms. The 2005 CON application was in essence a resubmission of the 2003 CON application with some changes. Some of those changes were terming the application to be for a new hospital rather than a replacement hospital, but the plans were for the exact same hospital. Because the DHHS had to comply with the SFMP, it could not have granted both the 2003 CON application and the 2005 application as the number of beds and operating rooms would have exceeded the SFMP's maximums. That would have created a duplication of facilities. One of the goals of the SFMP under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 131E-175, 131E-183(a)(1) was to avoid the duplication of facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the 2005 CON application afforded the applicant an adequate remedy for denial of the 2003 CON application and made the denial of, and the appeal of the denial of, the 2003 CON application a moot issue. The court granted the motion to dismiss and dismissed the applicant's and the town's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that defendant failed to preserve his claim of an error in the consideration at sentencing of evidence from co-defendant's trial.

Allen opinion, his appeal was not pending direct review, and his case was final. Defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing as to his armed robbery conviction as the taking of $ 1,300 and $ 700 from his victims did not support the finding of the taking of great monetary value as an aggravating factor. Defendant was not entitled to a new sentencing hearing on his assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury conviction as the victim's medical bills after being shot totalled $ 29,837.29, were &quot;excessive,&quot; and surpassed those normally incurred from such an assault. Defendant stipulated to the amount of the medical bills as he did not object to the State's recitation of the figure nor take exception to the amount when it was offered as support for a finding the non-statutory aggravating factor of great monetary loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's estate re-filed a medical malpractice suit against defendants, the hospital defendants, the medical practice defendants, and a doctor, after a first suit was voluntarily dismissed. The hospital defendants' motion to dismiss was granted by the Durham County Superior Court (North Carolina). The medical practice defendants' and a doctor's motions to dismiss were also granted. The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate argued that its re-filed complaint related back to the original complaint for statute of limitations purposes. The appellate court held that the suit was properly dismissed. The original complaint did not contain a N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) (2004) certification. The re-filed complaint was filed after the statute of limitations expired and the 120-day extension, if it had been sought, would have expired. There was no expert review prior to the commencement of the original action, which was contrary to the North Carolina legislature's intent in enacting Rule 9(j). The estate's claim that when the original action was filed, it did not have to comply with Rule 9(j) was rejected. The North Carolina Supreme Court vacated the intermediate court's Anderson ruling to the extent that it concluded that Rule 9(j) was unconstitutional before the estate voluntarily dismissed its original action. After the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision was released, the estate had to comply with Rule 9(j). The estate could have amended its complaint to include the Rule 9(j) certification and had the amendment relate back to the original filing date, but it did not do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) convicted appellant juvenile of felony murder, first-degree kidnapping, and attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, after it denied suppression of the juvenile's statements made after his request to call his aunt during the custodial interrogation. The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile challenged his convictions. The appeals court first held that because his aunt was neither a parent nor one of the of the listed parties in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-2101, he had no right to her presence during police questioning. Second, the juvenile was properly shackled out of concern of him wanting to run, especially where the shackles could not be seen and there was no evidence that the jury was even affected by, or even aware of, the restraints. Third, the juvenile conceded that his argument as to the murder indictment should have been dismissed where it unconstitutionally failed to allege all of the elements of first-degree murder had been previously rejected. Fourth, regarding two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, the trial court erred in finding an aggravating factor and sentencing the juvenile within the aggravated range, since the aggravating factor was neither a prior conviction nor admitted by the juvenile. Finally, it was reversible error to impose sentences for the first-degree kidnapping and attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon offenses, both of which the jury was instructed could serve as underlying felonies to the felony murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression order was affirmed, but the matter was remanded to arrest judgment on the first-degree kidnapping or the attempted robbery offenses as the underlying felony with respect to the juvenile's felony murder conviction in such a manner that would not subject him to a greater punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the county's motions to dismiss based on sovereign immunity and violation of rights under the North Carolina Constitution, and extinguished the county's subrogation lien. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy sheriff's motorcycle was struck by a vehicle while he was escorting a funeral procession. After the deputy sheriff settled his claims against the driver of the vehicle for the limits of her liability insurance, he received an insurance payment as a result of underinsured motorists coverage. The county paid the deputy sheriff workers' compensation benefits for medical expenses, temporary total disability, and permanent partial disability compensation. On appeal, the court found that, based upon the fact that the county government was subject to the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act and its provisions regarding payment and compensation under the Act, there was specific statutory authority authorizing the deputy sheriff to seek a determination under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-10.2(j) of the county's authority to file a lien against his settlement proceeds. Further, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-10.2(j) did not violate the Exclusive Emoluments Clause of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 32. Finally, the trial court's extinguishment of the lien under N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred by activating defendant's suspended sentences where those sentences were unconstitutionally aggravated in violation of Blakely v. Washington. The State alleged that this issue was not preserved for review as defendant failed to object to the imposing an aggravated sentence upon the revocation of her probation. However, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1446(d)(18) (2003) permitted review of sentencing errors even though defendant failed to object at trial. Second, the amended record failed to indicate that defendant stipulated to the relevant facts or consented to judicial fact finding of aggravating factors. Third, the court took judicial notice of the plea transcript and the trial court's findings of aggravation and mitigation and amended the record to include these documents ex mero moto. Defendant then argued that the trial court erred in activating her suspended sentences where those sentences were unconstitutionally aggravated without her stipulation or submission of the aggravating factors to a jury to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeals court agreed, warranting remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule at issue addressed pharmacist working hours. The appellate court held that the board's authority to regulate pharmacies did not extend to regulating working hours as set out in proposed rule. The North Carolina Department of Labor was the only entity with authority to regulate working hours of pharmacists in pharmacies. Contrary to the board's argument, none of the statutes cited by it, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 90-85.6(a), 90-85.21(a), 90-85.32, provided authority for the board to enact the proposed rule. By proposing the rule, the board sought the benefit of the commission's approval. However, the board did not challenge the constitutionality of the rule-making process until the commission objected to the proposed rule. Only after the board received an unfavorable outcome did it allege the process was unconstitutional. Thus, the board was estopped from raising a constitutional challenge to the commission's authority, and the trial court did not err by refusing to rule on that challenge.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court properly dismissed the constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the request for declaratory judgment because the hospital joint venture and the town failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by pursuing an administrative review hearing pursuant to N.C.

XIV was properly dismissed because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in that it failed to allege the lack of a rational basis; and (4) the claims against the regional hospital were properly dismissed because the complaint failed to meet the heightened standard required to overcome the regional hospital's Noerr immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed the orders of the Currituck County Superior Court (North Carolina), which dismissed their claims against defendants, the State of North Carolina, the State of North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Coastal Resources Commission, the Division of Coastal Management, and its director. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that they had exclusive ownership of the portion of a beach between the high tide mark and the vegetation line, identified as the dry sand beach. Plaintiffs sought to quiet title in that portion of the beach and, to that end, requested injunctive relief. Plaintiffs asserted that their developer had owned the portion of the beach at issue and had deeded the same to each plaintiff in their respective deeds. Plaintiffs' suit arose from various alleged negative conduct resulting from the public's use of the dry sand beach in front of their homes, including litter, noise, bonfires, relief of bodily functions, requests for use of the bathroom and the telephone, and unauthorized use of plaintiffs' outdoor showers. The court held, however, that plaintiffs' causes of action were barred because plaintiffs failed to properly allege in their complaint the State's waiver of sovereign immunity. Plaintiffs' reliance on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-10.1 (2003) as to waiver was misplaced since they failed to allege that defendants asserted any claim of title to the beach area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner challenged a special assessment imposed for the relocation of an inlet on the coast. The county's motion for summary judgment was granted, and the owner sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the project did not violate N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2, cl. 1 because the special assessment was imposed for a public purpose. Under the applicable two-prong test, the court determined that the assessment involved a reasonable connection with the convenience and necessity of the county. In making this decision, the court looked to the North Carolina Constitution, the public trust, and the public policy of North Carolina. Second, the activity benefitted the public in general since it resulted in a conservation of beaches. Next, the court held that the project complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 153A-185, 153A-186. Although the owner was permitted to challenge the special assessment, he was not allowed to challenge the choice of the methods used. In addition, the inlet project was one for which a special assessment was authorized under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153A-185.

Defendants were alleged to have tied up and bound the victims and ransacked the homes, stealing money.

Also, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of a prior incident because the two were very similar and the trial court judge repeatedly gave the jury a limiting instruction. The court did find error with the trial court failing to submit the aggravating factors to the jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the imposition of attorney's fees against one defendant was in error since that defendant was not given a hearing on the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for, inter alia, driving while impaired and driving while license revoked. In his case, he and his nephew had obtained a large amount of beer and consumed it. The nephew then drove off and had a fatal car accident. Defendant drove up to the accident scene and later gave statements to police. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. At trial, the State relied on the confessions to prove that defendant drove a car. The State also had several witnesses testify about observing defendant's driving and a police officer testify about defendant's license being revoked. Defendant was convicted of both offenses. The trial court, in sentencing him on the driving while impaired conviction, found a grossly aggravating factor. On appeal, the appellate court found the motion to dismiss was properly denied as to the driving while impaired charge since the confessions were properly corroborated, but was improperly denied as to the driving while license revoked since sufficient &quot;knowledge&quot; evidence was not presented. It also found that the grossly aggravating factor should have been submitted to the jury for it to find beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulling a trailer with his truck. The trailer was attached to the truck by a hitch, but without safety chains or cables. The trailer came loose from the hitch while defendant was driving, crossed into opposing lanes of travel and struck an oncoming vehicle, killing its driver. The appellate court found that the magistrate's order charging defendant with the offense of misdemeanor death by vehicle clearly provided that the charge was based on defendant's failure to secure the trailer to his vehicle with safety chains or cables as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-123(b). The order was sufficient to apprise defendant of the charge against him and to allow him to prepare a defense against the charge. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-123(c) required the use of safety chains or cables when a ball hitch was the primary towing attachment. Accordingly, a jury instruction regarding locking pins was not a correct statement of the law as it was undisputed that the primary towing attachment used by defendant was a ball hitch. Defendant did not raise his argument that &sect; 20-123 was unconstitutionally vague before the trial court, and thus the appellate court declined to review it.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that defendant should have been warned that the substance he allegedly consumed could impair him and thus, he was on notice that, by driving after consuming it, he risked crossing over the line into the territory of proscribed conduct. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on involuntary intoxication as he presented no evidence he was forced to take the medication; rather he asserted he took it voluntarily but did not know it was intoxicating.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a class action suit against defendant State, and others, seeking a declaration that 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424 violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), denied the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and granted the State's motion to dismiss. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424 enacted a tax on wages and other income already earned and, thus, was a retroactive tax in violation of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court found that the plain language of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 did not indicate in any way that the prohibition on retrospective taxes included a prohibition on a retrospective increase on an income tax rate. This case involved a new tax rate, not an entirely new tax. Moreover, the new tax rate began to apply only in the year in which the statute was enacted. At this point, neither an individual's annual income nor tax liability under the statute had yet been determined. Furthermore, the increased tax rate was not ineffectual in light of any purpose of 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424. Because the increase in the income tax rate under 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424 was not a tax upon an act, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens sued governmental defendants, challenging a $ 125 million loan from a highway trust fund (HTF) authorized by the North Carolina General Assembly and an $ 80 million transfer from the HTF authorized by the Governor of North Carolina. The Wake County Superior Court, North Carolina, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that these withdrawals from the HTF violated the North Carolina Constitution. The court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue their lawsuit. Plaintiffs' complaint did not claim that they suffered injury from the collection of the taxes which benefited the HTF. Rather, it challenged only certain withdrawals of taxpayer money from the HTF, which affected plaintiffs in the same way that it affected all citizens and taxpayers of the state. Thus, plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their action directly as injured taxpayers. Plaintiffs also contended that, as citizens, they had &quot;constitutional standing&quot; to bring this action. However, during the course of the litigation, plaintiffs abnegated their prayer for mandamus. Thus, plaintiffs were no longer seeking to have the allegedly wrongly withdrawn funds replenished, and their remaining requests for relief sought only a judicial declaration that the legislative and executive branches should not have made the challenged withdrawals from the HTF and should not make such withdrawals again. Therefore, plaintiffs' action as citizens was for an advisory declaration, which they had no standing to seek.</SPAN></P>

The Richmond County Superior Court (North Carolina) imposed a sentence in the aggravated range. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other things, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that a witness had the reputation for being a user of illegal drugs such as crack cocaine and that defendant's brother had the reputation for being a dealer of drugs. While the appellate court concluded that the admission of the reputation evidence violated N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(a), the appellate court found that the error was not prejudicial since the evidence regarding the witness was cumulative and there was ample evidence to convict defendant without evidence of his brother's reputation. The appellate court also held that the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the possession charges was proper because the State presented sufficient evidence of constructive possession, including evidence that defendant smelled of crack cocaine, had the characteristics of someone under the influence of drugs, and attempted to get inside his motel room when the officer approached. Next, the appellate court concluded that the erroneous entry of judgment and commitment for defendant under the habitual felon case number was merely a clerical error which the trial court was entitled to fix.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed.

The Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced him to a total of 120 to 153 months' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to defendant's contention, there was substantial evidence of taking indecent liberties with a child. Among other things, the victim testified that defendant tickled her in her privates, that he was tickling her leg and would start going up to her privates. Defendant's arguments that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of prejudicial evidence and denying his motion for a mistrial both failed under the plain error standard as defendant provided no explanation for why the evidentiary issue was prejudicial and plain error review did not apply to decisions made at the trial judge's discretion, such as the granting of a mistrial. Defendant next argued that his rights to due process and effective assistance of appellate counsel were violated by the failure to his trial counsel to request that the jury selection, bench conferences, and opening and closing statements be recorded. The appellate court found no error, noting that defendant made no motion for such recording. Finally, as to defendant's motion for appropriate relief, the appellate court found that, inter alia, the trial court erroneously aggravated defendant's sentence based on facts not found by a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Brunswick County (North Carolina) court denied the motion for a permanent injunction of plaintiffs, an advocacy group and an individual, declaring both 1998 N.C. Sess. Laws 83 (the Long Beach Act) and a local ordinance (first ordinance) to be constitutional, and awarded costs to defendants, a town and the state. Plaintiffs timely appealed from this order. Defendants sought dismissal of plaintiffs' appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998 the general assembly enacted the Long Beach Act, authorizing the town to pass ordinances providing for development of parks on municipal streets. Thereafter, the town enacted the first ordinance, designating as &quot;public parks&quot; all street ends that dead-ended into waterways in the town. The trial court then entered an order declaring that neither the Long Beach Act nor the first ordinance violated the state constitution. The town later repealed the first ordinance, replacing it with a second ordinance that did not close any streets or create street-end public parks. The parties agreed that the first ordinance was no longer before the court. Defendants argued that the relief sought by plaintiffs, a declaration that the first ordinance was unconstitutional, could not be granted in a declaratory judgment action where the ordinance no longer existed. The appeals court concluded that issues pertaining to the first ordinance were no longer before it, and the constitutionality of the Long Beach Act was not before it because there was no justiciable case or controversy concerning the Long Beach Act. Finally, the trial court's award of costs was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs hospitals sued defendants employers and insurers in the North Carolina Industrial Commission for refusing to pay amounts the Commission approved to the hospitals. The Commission declared N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-26(b) (1994), as it existed from July 1, 1995 to April 1, 1996, unconstitutional, and found the hospitals were not entitled to the amounts they sought. The hospitals appealed and defendants purported to cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Workers' Compensation Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-1 et seq., diagnostic related grouping (DRG) rates for conditions hospitals treated were set and hospitals were paid more or less than them. Defendants would not pay more than the rates. The Industrial Commission found N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-26(b) (1994), under which reimbursement amounts were approved, unconstitutional. The appellate court held the Commission could not declare a statute unconstitutional. The appellate court could not consider the question as no certiorari petition was filed, under N.C. R. App. P. 21, nor did a party seek suspension of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, under N.C. R. App. P. 2, nor did the Commission certify the question to the appellate court, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-86 (2004). N.C. R. App. P. 2 should not be used to confer jurisdiction on the appellate court absent a certification from the Industrial Commission. N.C. Gen. Stat. chs. 97 and 135 authorized requiring defendants to pay the approved amounts, so defendants were not entitled to relief under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 135-40.7(8) (1996), barring payments a payor was not legally obligated to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's accomplice shot a victim in an attempted robbery. The appellate court held a short form murder indictment was not unconstitutional as sentencing enhancement factors did not have to be stated in an indictment. Blakely did not bar amending the alleged crime date at trial as the indictment did not have to state sentence enhancers. The indictment's allegation of a crime date other than that proved, did not require dismissal as the indictment was properly amended, and the State could prove a crime charged was committed on a date other than that in the indictment. The fact that defendant committed a crime on probation did not have to be stated in an indictment, but it was error to add a point to his prior record level when whether he was on probation when he committed the crime was not submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. His probation did not have the safeguards of a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. At sentencing, neither Blakely nor Allen were decided, so he did not knowingly and intelligently admit he was on probation when he committed the crime, as he did not know he had the right to have a jury decide this sentence enhancer.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;97-39 (2003) to plaintiff, a deceased employee's estate administratrix. The trial court found that the decedent was last injuriously exposed to asbestosis hazards while employed by the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was exposed to asbestos products while working for a prior employer. Thereafter, he had other employment positions before working for the instant employer, wherein he was again exposed to asbestos. Jobs after that employment relationship terminated did not involve any exposure. The employee was eventually diagnosed with pulmonary abnormalities caused by asbestosis. The NCIC reversed the deputy commissioner's decision on the employee's benefits application. It found that the deceased employee had asbestosis, which caused his total disability and significantly contributed to his death, that his last injurious exposure was with the employer, and that he was entitled to TDBs and DBs under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;97-39. On appeal, the court found that the NCIC had authority to decide the death benefits claims. Further, the court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-61.6 (2003) was unconstitutional, as it violated the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, there was no time limitations bar thereunder, and the death benefits claim was deemed timely. There was competent evidence to support the NCIC's findings on the merits of the benefits claim, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-57 (2003).</SPAN></P>

After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of a sexual offense and not guilty of second-degree rape. He was sentenced and he appealed. The court found that denial of the dismissal motion was proper, as defendant's speedy trial rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 were not violated where he was granted multiple continuances and there was no showing of neglect or willfulness by the State. The trial court did not act arbitrarily in denying sequestration of the victim's mother. Denial of defendant's right to inquire into the victim's previous sexual activity for the purpose of attacking her credibility was proper. Other evidentiary rulings concerning admission of a letter, testimony of the victim's state of mind, and disclosure by the State of defendant's statement, were proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Ashe County Superior Court (North Carolina) of having committed a crime against nature. Defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and in submitting the offense of a crime against nature to the jury, on the grounds that the statute creating the offense, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-177 (2003), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant left a party with the 18-year-old victim and went back to his apartment. The victim had no recollection of leaving the party or any of the events that followed until the next morning. The victim awoke, naked, alone in defendant's bedroom, and had a sharp pain in her swollen vaginal area. The victim's pelvic area was bruised, and her vagina was swollen, red, and bleeding. Something had been forcibly inserted into her vagina, possibly repeatedly. A toxicology screen showed no alcohol, but revealed benzodiazepine. The jury found defendant not guilty of second-degree rape and second-degree sexual offense. The appellate court held that &sect; 14-177 could be used to prosecute conduct involving a minor, conduct involving non-consensual or coercive sexual acts, conduct occurring in a public place, or conduct involving prostitution or solicitation. Thus, the statute was facially constitutional. However, the jury, by its verdict, found that the evidence did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was non-consensual, that is, that defendant was helpless and therefore unable to consent to the sexual act. Thus, &sect; 14-177 was unconstitutionally applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court, Pitt County (North Carolina), sentenced defendant to a minimum term of 36 months and a maximum term of 53 months in prison for each of the three charges, the terms to run consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to defendant's argument, the appellate court found substantial evidence from which a jury could have found that defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the restaurant was occupied when he fired the shots in its direction. Prior to the subject incident, the restaurant had stayed open until 3:00 a.m., and the restaurant was located in an area where other establishments were open until the early morning hours. As to his sentence, defendant argued that the trial court erred in its finding of four aggravating factors when defendant did not admit to them and a jury did not determine them. The appellate court found that the trial court unilaterally found each of the aggravating factors without submitting them to a jury, thus violating Blakely and defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and requiring resentencing. Finally, the appellate court noted that the trial court did not err in finding that each aggravating factor alone outweighed the mitigating factor, a determination it made to provide guidance on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee North Carolina State Board of Certified Public Accountant Examiners adopted a declaratory ruling that denied, pursuant to N.C. Admin. Code. tit. 21, r. 8N.0307 (2004), appellant certified public accounting firm's request for a proposed name change. The accounting firm petitioned the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) for judicial review. The superior court affirmed the decision. The accounting firm appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board determined that the accounting firm's proposed name change from &quot;McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP&quot; to &quot;RSM McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP, Certified Public Accountants&quot; violated N.C. Admin. Code. tit. 21, r. 8N.0307 as the proposed name had a capacity or tendency to deceive. On appeal, the court found that the Board possessed the authority to regulate certified public accounting (CPA) firms and CPA firm names, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 93-12 (2003). Further, the Board promulgated N.C. Admin. Code tit. 21, r. 8N.0307 to regulate the names of CPA firms. Additionally, the State of North Carolina, through the Board, could regulate deceptive commercial speech without violating the accounting firm's right to freedom of speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. Moreover, the accounting firm failed to present any evidence that the Board treated another company similarly situated to the accounting firm differently or provided preferential treatment in violation of the accounting firm's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Finally, the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by substantial evidence in the whole record and were not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Superior Court, Guilford County (North Carolina), convicted defendant of robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of a store robbery. A photo lineup was admitted at trial without objection. Defendant argued on appeal that the denial of his motion to suppress the lineup identification was error. The appellate court held that the motion to suppress was insufficient to preserve the issue because defendant did not object when the lineup was offered into evidence. While N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 103(a)(2) (2004) permitted appellate review of an evidentiary ruling even though the party failed to object at trial, because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 103(a)(2) (2004) was inconsistent with N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1), the statute failed. Regardless of the title and placement of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 103 by the general assembly, the text of the rule made it one of practice and procedure. However, because it would have been a manifest injustice to defendant to not review his appeal on the merits after he relied on a procedural statute that was presumed constitutional at the time of trial, the appellate court reviewed the evidence. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress as the lineup was not impermissibly suggestive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial showed that defendant followed the victim into an elevator at a hotel and then followed her to her hotel room where he pushed her inside and robbed her. He then attacked her by pounding her head against a wall until she lost consciousness. When police contacted defendant, he confessed to taking money from the victim. At trial, he sought unsuccessfully to suppress his custodial statement to police. He was convicted. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's finding of fact that defendant was not coerced into a confession due to threats made against his wife was supported by competent evidence because both police officers testified that at no point did they indicate to defendant that his wife would be charged if he did not confess, nor did they promise defendant anything if he offered a confession. The court reversed the conviction of robbery with a dangerous weapon, finding that hands, fists, and feet could not be considered dangerous weapons for the purposes of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-87. Furthermore, the court found that there was no indication that the victim's life was threatened or endangered by an &quot;armed&quot; individual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action initially brought on behalf of plaintiff executrix's decedent against defendant wife, a jury in the Guilford County District Court (North Carolina) found that the wife had procured her marriage to the decedent by means of undue influence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that the annulment action could not have been properly maintained by the executrix after the decedent's death. The executrix had filed the case on the decedent's behalf as his guardian ad litem while the decedent was alive. Given that and the fact that substantial property rights hinged on the validity of the marriage, the appellate court ruled that the action did not abate on the decedent's death and that the executrix was entitled to pursue it. Undue influence was a proper ground to annul a marriage. The decedent was elderly at the time of the marriage, and there was evidence, inter alia, that he suffered from dementia and/or Alzheimer's. He was subject to constant association with, and supervision by, the wife and had little association with his family or friends in the months immediately before the marriage. The marriage left the decedent's existing estate plan in doubt and put the wife in a position to substantially reduce the amount that the decedent's daughter would inherit. There was also evidence that the wife procured the marriage and that the decedent was confused at the time of the marriage. Sufficient evidence supported the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) convicted defendant of first-degree arson after the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the incident in question, someone drenched a doormat in gasoline, set the mat on fire, and pushed it under a victim's door. In his first argument on appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because there was insufficient evidence that defendant was the perpetrator. The evidence showed that defendant began to harass the victims, his girlfriend and her new boyfriend. Defendant left a message threatening to burn up the couple if the ex-girlfriend did not return his call. On the night of the fire, defendant left another threatening message. Defendant's cellular telephone records established that he was in the vicinity of the victim's apartment. The gasoline on the doormat indicated that the fire was set deliberately. The appellate court held that this evidence was sufficient to submit the charge of first-degree arson to the jury. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay restitution to the victim's new boyfriend for damages suffered as a result of the fire. The State conceded that the trial court's order was not supported by the evidence and had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, but the case was remanded for modification of the restitution order.</SPAN></P>
