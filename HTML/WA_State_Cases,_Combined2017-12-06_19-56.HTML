</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent developer challenged the legality of two conditions imposed by petitioner city for approval of a preliminary plat for a residential subdivision. The trial court ruled that both conditions were unlawful. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed as to the first condition, an open space requirement, but reversed as to the second condition, a secondary access road, and upheld the condition. The city sought discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this Washington Land Use Petition Act case, the challenged conditions included a 30 percent open space set aside and provision of a secondary limited access road into the proposed development for emergency vehicles. Regarding the open space requirement, the instant court noted that the court of appeals determined that the requirement constituted an unconstitutional taking. However, the instant court concluded that the open space set aside condition violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020, and it did not reach arguments respecting the constitutionality of this condition. The open space set aside condition was an in kind indirect tax, fee, or charge on new development. Aside from an ordinance requiring a flat 30 percent set aside for every proposed subdivision, there was nothing in the record explaining why 30 percent was chosen as the amount of open space needed in this case. The open space set aside condition did not fall within any exception in &sect; 82.02.020. Regarding the secondary limited access road condition, the instant court held that, after balancing the various factors, this condition did not violate substantive due process and was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was affirmed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city sought review of the Washington Court of Appeals' decision that the city unconstitutionally took property belonging to respondent land company by requiring the company to make improvements to an existing street bordering its proposed subdivision as a condition of approving its plat application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the city failed to show an impact of the proposed subdivision and a solution roughly proportional to the impact, therefore the condition was invalid. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.130, an appellate court could grant relief from a land use decision, if the petitioner carried its burden of establishing at least one of the enumerated standards. The city asserted errors by the court of appeals, by claiming that the land use decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The appellate court found that the parkway did not meet city roadway standards even before the development was proposed. The required improvements would relieve a preexisting deficiency. The traffic studies found that the subdivision would have little to no impact on safety and operations on the section of the roadway the company was required to improve.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department credited defendant's presentence detention time against his enhancement time. The appellate court found the effect of the policy was to recharacterize presentence detention time as enhancement time, the policy conflicted with the mandates of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.150(1) (1996). If the department's interpretation was followed, a portion of the statute would be rendered meaningless. The department could not save its policy by qualifying an unambiguous mandate. In order to obey the legislature's commands, the department had to calculate sentences by applying the presentence detention time against the standard time. This would ensure that the department would maintain control over the incentive of earned early release credit for good behavior.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.130 simply defined the means by which eligible inmates could earn early release credit. Former Wash. Rev. Code 9.9A.150(1) defined which inmates were not eligible to earn early release credit. The 1995 amendment did not address the manner by which inmates could earn early release credit but rather addressed whether a particular inmate was eligible to earn early release credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition was granted to the extent that he sought reinstatement of the early release credit he earned in presentence detention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(1)(d). He filed a motion to suppress the drugs found by the police, and the Superior Court, Yakima County (Washington), denied the motion. Defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine in a stipulated facts bench trial. The Court of Appeals, Division Three, affirmed. Defendant's petition for review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled defendant over because of defendant's headlight was out. The officer approached the driver's side of the car. The officer smelled alcohol and noticed that defendant's eyes were bloodshot. Defendant admitted he had had a couple of beers. When asked why defendant had reached towards the passenger side just prior to the stop, defendant said he was getting the registration out of the glove box. He later admitted he reached over to hide an alcohol container. A frisk revealed no weapons, and the officer ultimately concluded defendant was not legally intoxicated. However, the officer continued to detain defendant, searched the car and defendant, and found drugs. Defendant was convicted pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(1)(d). The supreme court held that at the time the search was conducted, the officer did not have an objectively reasonable belief that defendant was armed and dangerous. Thus, the search was not justified based on officer safety concerns. Because the search of defendant's car was found invalid, the resulting discovery of drugs on defendant's person should have been suppressed as a fruit of the illegal search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured couple commenced a lawsuit against defendant driver. The driver's jury demand had not been received by the court and his subsequent motion to require a jury trial was denied. The driver appealed and contended that Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 38(d) was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The Court of Appeals, Division Two (Washington), held the rule was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's primary contention was that his failure to perfect his demand for a jury trial in accordance with the provisions of Rule 38(b) did not constitute his consent to waive his right to a jury trial. The driver contended that the Washington Supreme Court had no power to make a rule concerning waiver of jury trial. Only the legislature, according to the driver, could make such a rule. He based that contention on his assertion that Rule 38(d), which provided that a party's failure to perfect demand for a jury trial in accord with Rule 38(b) implied that a party's consent to the waiver of the right to a jury trial contravened the Washington state constitution. Affirming the court of appeals, the Washington Supreme Court held that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 placed a limitation on the authority of the legislature, not a grant of exclusive authority, concerning civil jury trial waiver. The authority of the legislature and the court was coextensive with respect to making provision for implied waiver of a jury in civil cases and Rule 38(d) was a constitutional exercise of the court's rule making authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition against respondents higher education coordinating board (HECB) and others, alleging that Washington's Educational Opportunity Grant (EOG) Program, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28B.101.010, violated Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4, and art. I, &sect; 11, and U. S. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5, and the First Amendment. The Thurston County Superior Court (Washington) struck down the EOG program, as it was constrained to follow case law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The EOG program was designed to meet the critical needs of &quot;placebound&quot; students, who for various reasons could not travel to a state institution to obtain a college degree. The legislature enacted the grant program based upon findings that, inter alia: (1) Washington's participation rate for upper division course work was 10 percent below the national average; and (2) the state's largest population growth was occurring in areas that were not served by a public university. The funds associated with the program were disbursed directly to financially needy students who then chose the institution that was most accessible to them. The Washington Supreme court held that the EOG program did not violate Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4, because that provision did not apply to institutions of higher education. The court further held that the EOG program did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 or the First Amendment, because the student had to comply with the program's religious exclusion. In reaching its conclusion, the court affirmed its prior decisions in Litchman and DeFunis and overruled Weiss and Graham to the extent that they conflicted with its analysis in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>

The Washington Supreme Court held that a rational juror could have concluded that the city failed to meet its burden to show that, on several occasions charged, one defendant exceeded the scope of his invitation, because he was either on public thoroughfares enroute to his fiancee's home or with his fiancee. However, the other defendant exceeded the scope of his invitation, because he was seen alone several blocks from his fiancee's apartment. The court held that, although defendants could assert their fiancees' invitations as a defense to a charge of criminal trespass, they both exceeded the scope of the invitation on the occasions when they were alone on the common areas, distant from their fiancees' apartments. In addition, the supreme court held that defendants' rights of intimate association were not unconstitutionally impinged by their exclusion from the development and rejected their overbreadth and vagueness arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The groups argued before the instant court, which granted the groups' petition for review, that they were entitled to interlocutory dismissal of the suit by means of a statutory writ of review or constitutional writ of certiorari.

The instant court concluded that dismissal of the developer's claims was required. The developer failed to establish a prima facie case of defamation. Even if there had been statements at public meetings which were claimed to be defamatory, the groups were entitled to immunity under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.510 (1999), as the developer failed to establish clear and convincing evidence that the groups' statements were made with actual malice. The developer's other claims also failed, as there was no separate evidence of facts establishing a prima facie case for tortious interference with the sewer agreements, tortious interference with the hearing process, or civil conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal of a court of appeals decision that affirmed his conviction on two counts of delivery of cocaine. He contended that the appearance of a state witness in prison garb, shackles and handcuffs, while testifying to a criminal association with defendant, was unfairly prejudicial. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the trial judge was not required to conduct a security hearing before the appearance of a state witness in prison garb and shackles. The state's supreme court held that the prohibition against physical restraints in the court room applied to all inmate witnesses. But because defendant did not object to the witness's appearance and failed to demonstrate that only a new trial could have cured the prejudice caused by that appearance, his conviction was affirmed. The court of appeals held, as a matter of law, that a defendant was never prejudiced when a government witness appeared in court in prison garb or shackles. The supreme court disagreed. The witness, while clad in clothing clearly denoting guilt and his status as a prisoner, testified to a criminal association with defendant. That associated guilt and prisoner status had the potential to prejudice the presumption of innocence to which defendant was entitled. The supreme court held that an inmate witness, whether testifying for the defense or the state, should not appear before a jury in restraints, absent a finding of necessity by the trial court based on considerations outlined in Hartzog.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners were the owners of three condominiums that were rendered uninhabitable when the soil underlying the property gave way precipitously during winter storms. The homeowners brought suit against several parties, including the city. Before allowing the condominiums to be constructed, the city, concerned about the possibility of landslides, had imposed several conditions on the developer. Those conditions included a covenant exculpating the city from liability for damages caused by soil movement. On review, the supreme court held that the city was not liable for negligently granting a permit to build on the site, and the exculpatory covenant was valid to the extent it released the city from liability resulting from soil movement resulting from the issuance of the permit. The covenant did not, and could not, exculpate the city for soil movement-related losses caused by the city's own negligence. The homeowners could pursue claims against the city arising out of negligent maintenance of the storm and water drain system.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's case was dismissed, but it was later reversed and defendant sought review. The supreme court stated that to stop and detain defendant, the officers needed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime was about to occur. Possessing or consuming alcohol in public was not a crime, and the supreme court declined to extend the Terry stop exception to include nontraffic civil infractions. The officers may also have possessed grounds to stop and detain defendant if the civil infraction either occurred in their presence or they had filed a statement with the court that they had a reasonable basis upon which to believe that a civil infraction had been committed. Defendant did not have actual or constructive possession of the bottle, thus the infraction did not occur in their presence. No statement was filed with the court.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that it did not. The court held that collateral estoppel did not apply, as the issue in Snohomish County was a different issue than the one in King County, which was, whether a prosecutor had independent evidence. Neither was Snohomish County bound by King County's immunity agreement with petitioner based upon the principles of contract law. Snohomish County conceded it believed it could not profit from the impermissible fruits of petitioner's bargained for immunity agreement in King County and that it could not prosecute petitioner without the second defendant's testimony, because without it there was no probable cause. However, the supreme court concluded that the doctrine of fundamental fairness which attached to all agreements for which leniency was offered for waiver of the right against self-incrimination required dismissal of the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the business contended the trial court erred in holding it responsible for cleaning up the original smelter site. The state contended the trial court erred in concluding the business could not be held liable constitutionally for cleaning the surrounding polluted area. The supreme court noted that while the business made an applied challenge, nothing had been applied and the supreme court would not render an advisory opinion. Moreover, the fourth requirement for a justiciable case was a judicial determination which would be final and conclusive. The instant case was not developed sufficiently for the supreme court to render a decision which would conclude the matter. The appellate court noted a regulatory taking existed when the regulation of land went to far. But the record did not permit a substantive due process analysis under applicable case law. While the harm sought to be remedied was significant, there was no record on the availability and effectiveness of less drastic protective measures. There was little evidence on the economic loss to the business and the issues were appropriate for trial court litigation. Thus, the case was not justiciable.</SPAN></P>

The Washington Court of Appeals, Division Three, transferred the Grant County case to the instant court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities argued that absent an express grant of the right to vote on a given annexation proposal, no constitutional right to vote on such a proposal existed.

It determined that the petition method of annexation did not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. It also determined that art. I, &sect; 12, provided greater protection than the equal protection clause when the threat was not of majoritarian tyranny but of a special benefit to a minority and when the issue concerned favoritism rather than discrimination. Finally, the instant court held that the petition method of annexation gave an impermissible privilege to owners of highly valued land and thus violated art. I, &sect; 12.

The supreme court disagreed. The city's ordinance aimed to regulate street blockage for periods in excess of four consecutive minutes. In addition, it required the railroad to schedule two-minute intervals between blocking incidents. The ordinance also prohibited rail car switching during peak traffic hours. The ordinance impacted areas of safety regulated by the federal government, because it affected the speed at which trains traveled, train length, and trains in physical motion. Therefore, the ordinance did more than touch upon or relate to safety, and the ordinance was preempted by federal law. The city's ordinance that reserved to it the authority to control railroad activities that interfered with city traffic was subject to preemption under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act and the Federal Rail Safety Act of 1970. Therefore, the court of appeals did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Washington, along with defendant county auditors, sought direct review in the instant court of a declaratory judgment of the Thurston County Superior Court (Washington), which held that S.B. 6865, 56th Leg., 1st Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2000) did not repeal the special excise tax levied under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.58.273, and that the State had the duty to collect it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted S.B. 6865, which repealed the state motor vehicle excise tax (MVET) and set license tab fees at $ 30. Plaintiffs, which together represented transit workers' labor unions and several transit agencies, argued that S.B. 6865 did not repeal Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.58.273 and that the State continued to have the duty to collect it. The State argued that the S.B. 6865 had repealed &sect; 35.58.273 by implication and that, if not, either municipal authorities or the county auditors, not the State, had the duty to collect it. The county auditors argued that if the special excise tax was not repealed, it was the State's responsibility to collect it. The instant court concluded that S.B. 6865 did not repeal &sect; 35.58.273 by implication. Although an initiative measure, which had been declared unconstitutional was certainly before the legislature when S.B. 6865 was being drafted, S.B. 6865 repealed considerably fewer code sections than were threatened by the initiative. The trial court correctly declared that the power to levy the special excise tax and the State's duty to collect it once it was levied were unaffected by S.B. 6865's repealing the MVET.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff agricultural pesticide handlers filed a declaratory judgment action stating that defendant department of labor and industries violated the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act of 1973 (WISHA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.17.050(4) and 49.17.240(2). The Thurston County Superior Court (Washington) ruled against the pesticide handlers on all causes of action. The appellate court reversed. The department petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the court of appeals properly concluded that the department had violated a statutory duty to promulgate a rule requiring mandatory blood testing for agricultural pesticide handlers. The supreme court held that plaintiffs failed to show that the department's 1993 rule was arbitrary and capricious but it determined that the department's denial of the plaintiffs' 1997 rule request was arbitrary in light of the department's post-1993 investigation, and therefore concluded that the department's failure to act was contrary to the requirements of WISHA, chapter 49.17 Wash. Rev. Code. The court reviewed the department's 1997 denial of the pesticide handlers' request under the standards set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.570(4)(c). Plaintiffs had the burden of showing the 1997 decision was arbitrary or capricious in light of the record at that time. The critical post-1993 evidence was the August 1995 technical advisory group's report, which stated that cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides could materially harm workers, and that medical monitoring by means of a simple blood test was &quot;the most well developed and feasible method&quot; for monitoring such exposure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was affirmed in part and reversed in part and the matter was remanded to the department with to initiate rulemaking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and appellant were both ordered confined as sexually violent predators (SVPs) following a probable cause hearing and commitment trials at which less restrictive alternatives (LRAs) to total confinement were not considered. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's confinement and petitioner appealed. The supreme court retained appellant's case after he preserved his right to appeal his trial court's confinement order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and appellant both served time for sexually violent crimes. As they were about to complete their sentences, the state petitioned for their commitment as SVPs. Both contended on appeal that the trial court should have considered LRAs at their probable cause hearings and commitment trials. The appellate court noted that the SVP statute, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09, did not allow consideration of LRAs at the probable cause hearing or commitment trial. It then held that it was a violation of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions for LRAs to confinement of SVPs to be considered only after a person had petitioned for release from confinement. Although the state had a legitimate purpose for classifying SVPs differently from those involuntarily committed for mental illness, not allowing LRAs to be considered before SVP commitment was not rationally related to the governmental objective of protecting society. The appellate court also held that the &quot;more likely then not&quot; standard for proving dangerousness in predator commitment cases did not violate equal protection, as it was not a lower standard than in mental illness commitment cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated petitioner's commitment order and remanded for a commitment trial. It also vacated appellant's commitment order and remanded. The court noted, however, that the trial court would have no power to order placement in an LRA should it determine that either individual should be released to an LRA. The decision of the court of appeals was affirmed in so far as it rejected the constitutional challenge to the standard of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the Court of Appeals, Division III, (Washington) decision that upheld her conviction and affirmed the trial court's order that authorized a bench warrant for violation of the conditions of her release pending sentencing in a prior case under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.2(j)(1) did not require a showing of probable cause, but required only a well-founded suspicion of a violation of those conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty for possession of methamphetamine and delivery of a controlled substance and was conditionally released on her own recognizance. A bench warrant was issued three days after the defendant pleaded guilty. The crux of the arrest warrant was that the defendant was spending time with a known drug user. While she was being arrested, the defendant attempted to give her purse to her mother, who was with her at the time. The police subsequently searched the purse and found methamphetamine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. Probable cause was not necessary to sustain an arrest warrant for a person who had pleaded guilty to a felony and was awaiting sentencing; such an arrest warrant only needed to be supported by a well-founded suspicion that the defendant had violated the condition of her release. The State's interest in supervising defendants outweighed the accused's interest to be free from a search absent probable cause. However, the information contained in the defendant's arrest warrant did not provide any indicia of reliability that the defendant had violated any condition of her release. The evidence was obtained as the result of an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in these cases was whether, in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, prior convictions used to prove a defendant was a persistent offender must be charged in the information, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The first defendant argued that under Apprendi he was entitled to formal notice, a jury trial, and a determination beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a persistent offender. The second defendant challenged his sentence on the grounds it exceeded the statutory maximum and the State failed to plead and prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The instant court rejected defendants' arguments, holding that unless and until the federal courts were to extend Apprendi to require such a result, additional protections were not required under the United States Constitution or by the POAA. No other court had yet extended Apprendi to hold that sentence enhancements based on the fact of a prior conviction were unconstitutional. Thus, the instant court adhered to its previous holding that such enhancements did not pose a due process problem under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case concerning the constitutionality of Initiative 722 (I-722), the Thurston County Superior Court (Washington) ruled I-722 unconstitutional on four separate constitutional grounds and further ordered a permanent injunction against implementation and enforcement of I-722.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">I-722 was presented to the electorate in November 2000. I-722 provided for nullification of certain 1999 tax and fee increases, exempted vehicles from property taxes, limited property tax increases to two percent annually, nullified various tax increases, authorized a onetime refund, and changed the method of assessing property taxes. I-722 passed, receiving 58 percent approval of the voters. Local governmental plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of I-722. The court held that I-722 violated the single subject clause of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. I-722 embodied two unrelated subjects by requiring the voters who supported one subject of the initiative to vote for an unrelated subject they might or might not have supported. Because the subjects in I-722 were unrelated, voters did not have an opportunity to cast a vote that clearly demonstrated their support for either or both subjects. In order to do so, the two subjects needed to be voted on separately. Because the court could not know if either subject of I-722 would have garnered popular support standing alone, the court declared I-722 void in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases in which plaintiffs sought access to, inter alia, traffic accident reports held by governmental defendants, the Washington Court of Appeals, in the first case, held that a privilege under 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 409 did not cover accident reports. In the second case, the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) granted plaintiffs' discovery requests. Defendants appealed. The instant court granted direct review of the second case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues in the cases were whether: (1) Washington law barred disclosure or discovery of automobile accident reports; (2) material and data sought by plaintiffs were &quot;compiled or collected,&quot; pursuant to 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 152, such that they were covered by a federal privilege established by 23 U.S.C.S &sect; 409, as amended by Congress in 1995; and (3) Congress exceeded its enumerated powers under the federal constitution. The instant court held that the accident reports were discoverable, even though they were not admissible as evidence. The 1995 amendment to 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 409 was unconstitutional and thus unenforceable, insofar as it made state and local traffic and accident materials and data nondiscoverable and inadmissible in state courts, simply because they were also &quot;collected&quot; and used for federal purposes. Only materials and data originally created for the statutorily identified federal purposes were lawfully covered by the federal privilege, and thus, exempted from public disclosure under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.310(j). The instant court concluded that one of the plaintiffs was entitled to attorney fees, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.340(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court vacated the lower courts' rulings and remanded for supplementation of the record and further proceedings not inconsistent with the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

A hearing examiner reversed the city's permit denial. The superior court upheld the hearing examiner, but granted a stay. The Court of Appeals of Washington, Division Two, found for the city, holding that the nonconforming mining use had been abandoned. The developer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer purchased a portion of an 80-acre site from a land company that had continuously mined small portions of the site for sand and gravel as a valid nonconforming use subject to an abandonment provision. Before the developer's purchase, local authorities had realigned roads cutting off the knoll at issue from the rest of the site. The developer purchased the knoll and land adjacent to it for development, intending to level the knoll in order to provide fill for the adjacent property. He claimed a right to grade the knoll based upon the prior owner's nonconforming mining use. City residents protested. Having granted review to petitioner, the supreme court adopted the doctrine of diminishing asset and determined that the previous owner's legal nonconforming mining use extended to the boundaries of the 80-acre parcel of land which included the knoll, and vested in the developer, the successor in interest. It concluded that the city had not established an act or omission that would prove that that nonconforming use had been abandoned. That the parcel had not yet been mined and was sold without mention of mining was not conclusive.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 4.16.310, sought review of a judgment of the Washington Court of Appeals, which held that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution or the privileges and immunities clause of the Washington Constitution, and affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the builders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January 1997, three condominiums were extensively damaged due to a landslide caused by a severe rainstorm. The association brought suit against, inter alia, the builders. The builders argued that the association's claims were barred by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.310, the builders' limitation statute. The association argued that the statute denied equal protection of law to various classes who were excluded from asserting the statute as a defense. Because the association's claims were barred before it could even file a claim, the association also contended that the statute violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, by denying it access to the courts. The court held that the statute did not violate either the federal or state constitutions. The classifications created by the statute bore a rational relationship to the legislature's legitimate purpose of protecting builders from excessive liability. The statute did not unfairly shift liability. Because the court recognized that the legislature has broad police power to pass laws tending to promote the general welfare, the court declined to determine whether a right to a remedy was implied by the language of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a disciplinary hearing, the Commission found by a mere preponderance that appellant doctor had inappropriate sexual contact with three of his patients and was unfit to practice medicine. His license was indefinitely revoked. The supreme court accepted review after the trial and appellate courts had affirmed the revocation, and determined that the Commission had applied an incorrect standard of proof. The court applied a three part test to determine that a clear preponderance of the evidence was required to deprive the accused doctor of the property and liberty interests represented by his professional license. It found first that medical disciplinary proceedings were &quot;quasi-criminal&quot; and that loss of the doctor's medical license could be loss of his livelihood and reputation; secondly, that the risk of erroneous result required a heightened burden of proof; and thirdly, that an increased burden of proof would not have a fiscal impact upon the state, or appreciably change the nature of the hearing per se. That the public had an interest in the competent provision of health care services lent even greater need for the higher standard of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the city abused its discretion under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.04.180 by expanding the definition of &quot;dependents&quot; to include domestic partners. The city argued that it had discretion to define the term &quot;dependents&quot; because the legislature did not define the term in the statute. In addition, the city contended that the distribution of employee benefits was a local interest and that it had broad power to regulate those benefits. The supreme court held that the benefit program did not violate Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11. Appellant failed to show that the legislature intended to preempt the city from defining &quot;dependents&quot; as including domestic partners. The city's inclusion of domestic partners in its benefits program was consistent with the plain meaning of &quot;dependents&quot; as expressed in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.04.180. The city's recognition of domestic partnership was limited, and the program did not unconstitutionally interfere with the legislature's ability to regulate familial relationships on a statewide level.</SPAN></P>

On review of that decision, the supreme court held that although it agreed with the ultimate result of the court of appeals' decision, it did not agree with that court's reasoning. The Supreme Court of Washington did not agree that the fact that the arrests of respondents were accomplished without warrants violated their rights afforded by the U.S. Const. amends. I, IV, XIV.

Rev. Code &sect; 46.70.021, the show's promoter challenged the statute as violative of its First Amendment rights. After a trial court dismissed the legal challenge and a jury found facts indicating that the statute had been violated, an intermediate appeals court held that the promoter could not seek declaratory relief under Wash Rev. Code &sect; 7.24.070, because the parties did not have genuinely opposing interests. The high court agreed, but added that justiciability was also absent because the parties' alleged opposing interests were not direct and substantial, but entirely hypothetical. The promoter failed to show it suffered any business disadvantage because of enforcement of the licensing statute, which aimed at preventing consumer fraud, and also failed to establish that unlicensed dealers intended to show, without selling, their wares.</SPAN></P>

It was impossible to say with certainty that the superior court would have imposed the same sentence had it used the proper offender score. Defendant demonstrated that he was entitled to relief under Wash. R. App. P. 16.4 in that he was sentenced on the basis of an incorrectly calculated offender score.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and attempted murder based on vicarious liability. The Court of Appeals (Washington) reversed on the grounds that the trial court's instructions erroneously allowed the jury to convict defendant without finding that he was legally accountable as an accomplice. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with various criminal activities based on vicarious liability. The jury was instructed under two alternative theories: conspiracy and accomplice liability. The instructions allowed the jury to convict defendant of vicarious liability for the substantive crimes committed by his alleged coconspirators without finding him guilty of the underlying conspiracy. The jury could have found defendant guilty of conspiracy based on the Pinkerton doctrine, which was incompatible with Washington law. The accomplice liability statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.020, required knowledge of the specific crime charged, and not merely any foreseeable crime committed as a result of the complicity. The trial court erred in instructing the jury that they could find the defendant guilty of a substantive crime committed by his coconspirators merely because that crime was foreseeable. The error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment was affirmed on other grounds and the case was remanded for a new trial.

The instant court held that defendant failed to meet the requirements to prevail on either contention. Although the evidence was sufficient to support a diminished capacity instruction, the instant court rejected the contention that counsel's failure to request the instruction was ineffective assistance of counsel per se. The question of whether counsel's performance was ineffective was not amenable to per se rules, but required a case by case analysis. Defendant failed to show that confidence in the jury's verdict was undermined by the failure of his counsel to request the diminished capacity instruction. Thus, defendant did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, King County (Washington) of misdemeanor criminal harassment under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i) or (1)(a)(iv) (1992). The court of appeals affirmed, and defendant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because while it prohibited any act intended to harm another person's physical or mental health or safety, it contained no meaningful definition of the term &quot;mental health.&quot; The supreme court agreed, finding that the statute did not define the offense in a way a reasonable person would know what conduct was prohibited. Without knowing what was meant by mental health, the requirement that one intentionally commit an act designed to substantially harm the mental health of another did not indicate what that act might be. Moreover, use of the term was unconstitutionally overbroad insofar as it restricted constitutionally protected speech, subjecting it to a strict scrutiny test it failed to meet. The court further found that severing the term &quot;mental&quot; from the statute cured the constitutional infirmity. Finally, it was impossible to discern whether the jury found defendant violated former &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i), which pertained only to physical injury, or &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(iv), or both. Consequently the conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court reversed the court of appeals, holding that the Oregon officer lacked statutory or common law authority to arrest defendant in Washington, because there was no evidence that the officer had ever completed a training program as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.93.090, in order to authorize her to act within Washington when in fresh pursuit. Second, while the officer had probable cause to arrest, the existence of probable cause in and of itself did not render the stop constitutionally valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Snohomish County Superior Court (Washington) jury convicted defendant of aggravated first degree murder, first degree kidnapping, and first degree rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to suppress physical evidence seized from his van and residence because his van was impounded without a warrant and without probable cause and the search warrant subsequently issued was also without probable cause. The instant court concluded that the factual information in the affidavit for a search warrant established probable cause, and it upheld the trial court's finding of no actual deliberation or effort to omit material information by the affiant or obvious reasons to doubt the affiant's veracity in making the affidavit. The search warrant issued was not impermissibly broad; the van's seizure without a warrant was proper. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in twice denying defendant's motion for a change in venue. The instant court found no cumulative error that denied defendant a fair trial. The trial court's order that defendant appear in shackles during certain portions of the trial was harmless error. Admission during the penalty phase of a police statement regarding defendant's prior false imprisonment conviction was unfairly prejudicial, requiring the vacation of defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for aggravated first degree murder, first degree kidnapping, and first degree rape were affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, an Oregon resident, began sending unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE), or &quot;spam,&quot; over the Internet.

Code ch. 19.86, by using false or misleading information in the subject line of his UCE messages, and through other misrepresentations. The trial court held that the Act unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce, and dismissed the suit. The supreme court reversed, holding that the Act was sufficiently limited by reaching only those deceptive UCE messages directed to a Washington resident or initiated from a computer located in Washington. The Act did not impose liability for messages that were merely routed through Washington or that were read by a Washington resident who was not the actual addressee. The local benefits of the Act outweighed any burdens placed on those sending commercial e-mail messages.</SPAN></P>

The Washington Supreme Court found that: (1) all three Covell criteria supported the conclusion that the standby fee was not actually a regulatory fee, but rather a thinly disguised property tax designed to raise funds to finance broad-based public purposes, and (2) since Soap Lake, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 13.08.175 imposed this property tax on the mere ownership of select parcels of real estate, without regard to property value, it violated Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Spokane County (Washington), where he was convicted of, inter alia, first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and sentenced to death. Defendant claimed numerous errors occurred during the trial which justified a reversal of those convictions and the sentence for aggravated first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged errors included, inter alia, the trial court's granting of continuances over his objections, error from the lack of due diligence by the State during discovery of DNA evidence, denial of self representation, and lack of proper notice of the State's intention to seek the death penalty. On those issues, the court found either no error, or a lack of prejudice from any error. The court also held defendant did not unequivocally request to proceed pro se. Defendant also claimed error from the trial court's comments, at the start of trial, about the penalty phase, admitting statements of a victim, and jury instructions for aggravating circumstances. Finding the penalty phase comments to be only a roadmap of the proceedings, the statements admissible, and the instructions accurate, the court found no error. During the penalty phase, defendant claimed error by the trial court's denial of a continuance for a competency exam; the court held there was no threshold showing of incompetence. Finally, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the procedures and application of the death penalty. The court held those arguments to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, petitioners sought review of separate decisions of the Washington Court of Appeals, Division Two. First petitioner appealed the appellate court's decision affirming his conviction for first degree unlawful possession of a firearm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that 1994 and 1996 amendments to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040 violated constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws by prohibiting them from owning, possessing, or having control of any firearm because of their prior felony convictions. The State argued that the first petitioner's conviction did not violate the ex post facto clauses because he was being punished for his conduct after enactment of the 1994 amendment and not for his prior conduct. In the second petitioner's case, the State made a similar argument, but also asserted that &sect; 9.41.040 was not designed solely for punishment, but was designed primarily to protect the public. The court held that the amendments did not violate the ex post facto clauses and did not punish petitioners for past offenses nor increase their punishment for prior convictions. Rather, incident to the State's regulation of firearms to protect the safety of the public, the prohibition of firearm possession by convicted felons was designed to regulate more closely the ownership, possession, and control of firearms by those who, because of prior felony convictions, were unfit to be entrusted with any firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with traffic infractions.

The court held respondent's document did not constitute judicial process. In none of his documents did he indicate they were signed by or issued by a judicial officer nor that any conduct attendant to the documents was subject to judicial action. On its face, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.12.010 was not ambiguous. Respondent completely disregarded court rules applicable to the infraction citations issued him, and his pseudo-legalistic documents contained language, terms, citations and expressions which made no sense. The court held the barratry statute did not proscribe conduct by resort to inherently subjective terms. Thus, although &sect; 9.12.010 did not define the term &quot;judicial process,&quot; the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were each convicted of criminal offenses in the district court by juries drawn from pools picked from an area consisting of three county zip codes. Arguing that the state constitution required the jury pools be selected from the county as a whole, all three appealed to the superior court where each case was affirmed. The Court of Appeals, Division One (Washington) granted discretionary review and affirmed the consolidated cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the petitioners contended that the district court failed to substantially comply with the statute governing jury selection, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.36.050, because the entire county did not serve as the source for prospective jurors. The court found that no material departure from the requirements of the jury selection statute was demonstrated by the petitioners, nor was any actual prejudice shown as a result of substantial, though inexact, compliance with the statute's terms. The procedure used was a fair approximation of the district court's electoral district. There was no suggestion that there was any exclusion of any class of citizen or that the jury list was not a representative cross-section of the community. Nor was there any showing that the jury list, the venire or the jury itself was so composed that there might have been any inherent bias or prejudice against the petitioners. The court also held that the petitioners failed to demonstrate that the statute violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. Petitioners' argument that art. I, &sect; 22 required that the jury panel be comprised of jurors selected from the entire county was unpersuasive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The court found that the jury selection statute was substantially complied with in the selection of jury panels for the petitioners' cases, and the petitioners failed to demonstrate actual prejudice from the alleged failure to comply with the statute. The court also found that the statute conformed to the jury requirements of the Washington Constitution by preserving randomness in the selection of the jury pools.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.480 was not unconstitutional because the deductions were not taxes. The court further held that defendant violated Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioners each sought, and were granted, discretionary review, in a consolidated appeal, of the dismissals of each of their personal restraint petitions, in three different division of the Court of Appeals (Washington) challenging their risk classifications under Wash Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4.24.550, 72.09.345, providing for the risk classifications of sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were each convicted sex offenders. Prior to their releases from prison, the Department of Corrections' End of Sentence Review Committee (ESRC) assigned each of them risk classifications, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.345(4). This information was communicated to local law enforcement in each of the communities in which the offenders planned to reside, which had the authority to make the final determination of the offender's risk classification, after reviewing the ESRC's recommendation, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.550(4)(b). These classifications determined the persons and agencies to whom personal information about each offender would be disclosed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.550(3)(a)-(c). Each petitioner claimed this procedure violated their rights to procedural due process and filed personal restraint petitions with various divisions of the court of appeals. Each petition was dismissed, and petitioners appealed. Petitioners did not establish they had a liberty interest arising out of Wash Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4.24.550 or 72.09.345, and, in the absence of such interest, no due process rights attached to their risk classifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals was affirmed in each case because petitioners did not demonstrate they had a liberty interest in their risk classifications, so their rights to procedural due process were not implicated by the imposition of those classifications or by any resulting disclosure of information about them pursuant to those classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the Public-Private Transportation Initiatives Act (PPI Act), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 47.46, was constitutional, whether the advisory election and the rules adopted to implement the PPI Act were valid, and whether the agreement for the construction of a second bridge was valid and enforceable. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the PPI Act and the validity of the advisory election, but reversed in part, because the agreement provided for tolling of the existing bridge, which violated a prohibition on tolls specified in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.56.271. Thus, to the extent the agreement for the new bridge was inconsistent with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.56.270 and .271, it could not be given effect because it exceeded the statutory authority of the Washington State Department of Transportation. The agreement also violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.56.240 by allowing a private entity instead of the transportation commission to fix toll rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that the Public-Private Transportation Initiatives Act (PPI Act) was constitutional, and the challenge to the validity of the process was barred by laches, but reversed the trial court's ruling because the toll collecting agreement entered into under the PPI Act violated existing state law without implicitly repealing it, and was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought an action against respondents seeking additional reimbursement for residential services provided to mentally ill people, contending that respondent health services department established a two-tiered reimbursement structure in violation of Washington's Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Wash.

The trial court agreed with petitioners; however, the appellate court reversed, holding that no APA rule making was required for respondent health services department to utilize a two-tiered reimbursement scheme. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, determining respondent health services department did not violate the APA, as the legislature amended Wash. Rev. Code ch. 34.05 in 1994 to clarify its view that rule-making requirements did not apply. Further, the court found the legislative change applied retroactively. Finally, the court concluded the legislature did not unconstitutionally delegate its power to respondent health services department.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mobile home park owners' association appealed from an order of the Washington Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing petitioner's complaint alleging that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 59.23.005 violated the takings clause of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mobile home park owners' sought a declaration that the mobile home parks--resident ownership act (the Act), Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.23.001 et seq., created an unconstitutional taking of property in violation of amended Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, as well as U.S. Const. amend. V. The superior court denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the Act did not amount to an unconstitutional taking of property. The court, after examining the texts of both state and federal constitutions and determining that the state's constitution extended broader rights to its citizens than did the federal constitution, held that the right of first refusal was a valuable property right in the &quot;bundle of rights&quot; afforded private property owners. As such, the forced transfer of this right was in direct violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and constituted an impermissible taking. Furthermore, because such private use did not fall within specifically articulated exceptions, the Act was invalid and thus, the order of the Court of Appeals was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the statute was invalidated as unconstitutional; the statutory grant of a right of first refusal to mobile home park tenants amounted to a taking without just compensation having been first paid. Moreover, such transfer was legislatively granted to tenants who were private persons, not the public, an absolute prohibition with or without compensation.</SPAN></P>

The Washington legislature properly granted respondent the authority to transfer inmates to a private, out-of-state correctional facility. Scope of respondent's power to transfer inmates, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.68.010, to a private, out-of-state correctional facility, was clarified by the enactment of 2000 Wash. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 1, which was a curative act applied retroactively. Due process rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 were the same as those under the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment declaring an initiative unconstitutional in its entirety. The initiative sought to set motor vehicle license fees to $ 30, to eliminate various taxes, and to require voter approval of future increases in state and local taxes, with certain types of &quot;taxes&quot; excluded from that mandate. The initiative violated both requirements of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. First, the act had more than one subject. Second, the act's title was inadequate. In particular, the act's title failed to indicate that, as used in the act, the term &quot;tax&quot; connoted something much broader than the commonly understood meaning of that term. In effect, the initiative modified the provisions in Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, by creating a new referendum process for tax increases, but did so without complying with the procedures established for amending the state constitution. In addition one section of the initiative violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37 because it failed to set forth an existing law that was amended or revised by the initiative. The offensive provisions were not severable from the rest of the act, and therefore the entire act was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment declaring initiative invalid in its entirety affirmed. The initiative was unconstitutional because it had more than one subject, its title was inadequate, it improperly delegated legislative authority, and it failed to set out fully statutes that it amended or revised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with persistent prison misbehavior under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070. The trial judge dismissed the charge, finding the statute constituted an unconstitutional delegation of Legislative authority to the Department of Corrections (DOC). The appellate court affirmed. The State petitioned for review. Respondent contended that, because the DOC failed to appropriately promulgate a list of infractions to form the basis of a prosecution under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070, the State was barred from prosecuting him. The court affirmed. The fact that the DOC had a preexisting list of internal prison rules labeled as serious infractions was not enough to fulfill the statutory mandate of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070. The rules, by their terms, dealt only with maintaining internal prison discipline by creating a system of incentives for conforming behavior and disincentives for nonconforming behavior. The DOC erred by simply applying its list of serious infractions already promulgated in a different context to give substance to the felony of persistent prison misbehavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of judgments from Superior Courts of Snohomish and King Counties (Washington) affirming respondent Pollution Control Hearings Board on threshold issues and in four of five consolidated cases denying groundwater appropriation permits based on groundwater sources being in hydraulic continuity with surface water sources and appropriations thus being foreclosed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.290.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Pollution Control Hearings Board upheld respondent Department of Ecology's denial of appellants' several applications to withdraw groundwater from surface water sources, on the basis that the groundwater sources were in hydraulic continuity with surface water sources and further appropriations were foreclosed by statute. In five consolidated cases from two counties, the board, then the superior courts, and finally the court addressed the common statewide threshold issues and then the individual issues. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part, concluding that hydraulic continuity was not by itself a basis to deny applications, as it was not impairment as a matter of law, but affirming three of the denials and the threshold issues. Doctrine of prior appropriation applied. Before appropriation permit could be issued, water must have been available for a beneficial use. If withdrawal would impair existing rights, including minimum flow rights, denial was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments were affirmed on threshold issues and three individual cases but reversed on two cases. Hydraulic continuity between groundwater and surface water source with unmet minimum flows or closed to further appropriation was not impairment as matter of law. Direct and measurable impact on surface water need not have been shown before denial, nor significant measurable stream flow effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged and convicted in the trial court for first degree rape of a child pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.073. Section 9A.44.073 was not enacted until nearly two years after the offense occurred. Subsequently, petitioner filed a personal restraint petition (PRP) more than one year after judgment became final seeking relief from his sentence on the basis that his criminal conduct occurred before the effective date of the statute creating the offense. The appellate court dismissed the petition but, on further review, the court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded the case. Petitioner's conviction was invalid on its face, such that consideration of the merits of petitioner's PRP was not barred by the one-year time limit of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. Petitioner was entitled to relief by means of his PRP because his incarceration for an offense which was not criminal at the time he committed it was unlawful and a miscarriage of justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, believing that they were the illegitimate children of the deceased's late husband, brought this action seeking to impose a constructive trust against petitioner representative of petitioner estate of the deceased, as deceased was the coexecutor and sole beneficiary of petitioner late husband's estate. Alternatively, respondents sought to reopen petitioner late husband's estate. The trial court granted summary judgment for petitioners, dismissing respondents' claims with prejudice. The appellate court reversed and, on further review, the court reversed the appellate court and affirmed the trial court. The court concluded that the requisite equitable base to impose a constructive trust did not exist, as respondents were not legally entitled heirs at the time of the late husband's probate and it was clear that the late husband did not intend for respondents to take a share of his estate as pretermitted heirs. Respondents failed to show that they were entitled to reopen the late husband's estate, as the original decree of distribution was not void by reason of a jurisdictional defect and there was no evidence of fraud in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim allegedly robbed defendant. Thereafter, and presumably in retribution, defendant and several accomplices beat victim. During the affray, defendant twice stabbed victim with a pocketknife. The stabbing punctured an artery between victim's ribs, which caused extensive bleeding in victim's chest cavity. Surgery was performed. Two days after returning home from the hospital, victim died. The medical examiner ruled that victim's death was due to a stab wound. Acute cocaine and heroin abuse were listed on the death certificate as contributing factors. The trial court precluded defendant's counsel from arguing to the jury that victim's death was caused by his use of drugs, or his failure to seek medical attention. Lower appellate court reversed. Trial court's judgment was reinstated. There was no evidence that victim's drug use or failure to seek medical attention caused a fatal injury independent of the stabbing, or that these acts constituted a subsequent, proximate cause that defendant could not have reasonably anticipated. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in preventing defendant's counsel from making this argument to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the conviction and denial of petitioner's motion to suppress, holding that the police were justified in stopping petitioner and questioning her about her age. On appeal, the court reversed petitioner's conviction. The court held that the community caretaking function exception to U.S. Const. amend. IV did not justify seizure of petitioner by police. The police had no articulable suspicion that petitioner had committed a criminal offense and was prevented from terminating the encounter when police grabbed her arm, forcing her to remain and answer questions about her age. Because the seizure of petitioner was unconstitutional, the cocaine subsequently seized by police should have been suppressed. With suppression of the cocaine, there was no evidence supporting petitioner's conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed and plaintiffs cross-appealed from summary judgment rulings.

Plaintiffs sued defendants, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Secretary of the Department of Corrections, and the school districts in which the prisons were located, concerning plaintiffs' right to education. The reviewing court held that individuals under age 18 incarcerated in adult State prison facilities had a constitutional right to public education and that their constitutional right was satisfied by Wash.

On review, appellant contended the superior court erred in reading the statute as allowing funds in excess of contribution limits to be used for the political advertisement. The court affirmed. Wash Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.640 limited contributions to candidates for office and political parties. The advertisement here was issue-oriented, and therefore protected under the free speech clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. Accordingly, Wash. Rev.

Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.680(3) (&sect; 680(3)) violation of withholding funds for political purposes without first getting written authorizations. Respondent education association moved to dismiss, claiming it was not a &quot;political committee.&quot; The court dismissed respondents school districts as defendants, and dismissed claims against respondent education association for &sect;680(3) violation. Appellate issues were: (1) whether respondent education association, as a labor organization, was an &quot;other person or entity&quot; under &sect;680(3); and (2) whether Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 390-17-100 properly required annual written authorization only when payment was made to a political committee or a state or local candidate. Appellants cited no authority for its &sect;680(3) argument and constitutional claims, and did not identify statutory ambiguity regarding labor organizations. The plain words of &sect;680(3) did not include labor organizations. The appellate court affirmed, thereby refusing to require annual written authorization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of two judgments of the Superior Court, King County (Washington), which required that the State's petition to commit respondents as sexually violent predators under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09 allege a recent overt act by respondents, both of whom were incarcerated when petition was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09 or due process required proof of a recent overt act when respondents had, at some point, been previously released into the community but were incarcerated on the day the State's sexually violent predator petitions were filed. The court concluded that, because, at the time the sexual predator petitions were filed, respondents were incarcerated for sexually violent offenses, or for acts that themselves would have constituted a recent overt act, due process did not require the State to prove a further overt act occurred between arrest and release from incarceration. For incarcerated individuals, a requirement of a recent overt act under the &sect; 71.09 would have created a standard which would have been impossible to meet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Periods of temporary release after respondents' arrests and prior to their extensive confinement did not modify applicable statute's unambiguous directive that the State need not prove a recent overt act when the subject of a sexually violent predator petition was incarcerated on the day the petition was filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed judgment of the Court of Appeals, Division II (Washington), which reversed respondent's conviction for violation of a domestic violence protection order under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Primary issue was whether a third violation of a domestic violence protection order, which prohibited respondent from coming within one mile of a named person's residence, when respondent had two prior convictions for violation of domestic violence no-contact orders, constituted a class C felony under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.110(5), although respondent did not enter the residence. Appellate court, in reversing respondent's conviction, concluded that trial court erred because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.060(1)(b) did not authorize a court to exclude respondent from any particular distance from a residence. The court reversed appellate court's decision, concluding that the order was clear in its restraining language and could be justified under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.060(1)(e) as &quot;other relief&quot; considered necessary for the protection of the named person. Although appellate court based its decision solely upon application of &sect; 26.50.060(1)(b) and &sect; 26.50.110(5), it should instead have harmonized &sect; 26.50.110(1) and (5), and it should have considered trial court's authority to impose a one-mile distance exclusion against respondent under &sect; 26.50.060(1)(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged finding that he did not satisfy the one-year residence requirement of Wash. Rev.

Code &sect; 29.65.020 and a petition contesting appellant's certificate of election. The undisputed facts showed that, only three months prior to the election, appellant established residence in the city. Upon learning of the residency requirement the month before, he had asked his ex-wife to let him use her address and falsify residency information. Appellant's working and allegedly sleeping on occasion at a commercial premises in the city did not constitute a change of residence. He had fair notice of the meaning of &quot;residence,&quot; and his statements to his ex-wife demonstrated a lack of good faith compliance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county determined that petitioner's church site did not conform with the zoning code and ordered petitioner to cease its activities or to apply for a conditional use permit.

The court reversed the conviction, finding that the ordinance was overbroad, as it reached speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, because by using the term &quot;profane,&quot; it reached speech critical of a religion; that respondent city failed to establish it had the police power to pass an ordinance that so burdened speech; that the ordinance was vague as it failed to offer sufficient notice of what was proscribed, as &quot;legitimate communication&quot; was a highly subjective standard; and that respondent failed to meet its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would have convicted petitioner without the constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9.41.300(1) was not an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers because the legislature did not delegate to the judiciary the authority to define an element of the crime, had an established practice of defining prohibited acts in general terms, leaving to the judicial and executive branches the task of establishing specifics, and respondent did not show that the legislature should have established procedural safeguards to protect against arbitrary action by the local judicial authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed suit against petitioners, an administrative agency, an agency officer, and the state, for unconstitutional search, seizure, and use of excessive force, and false arrest, false imprisonment, and assault and battery after respondent husband's arrest for alleged illegal construction practices and failure to provide information to petitioner officer. The court found respondent husband's arrest unlawful because withholding information was not criminal resistance, and petitioner officer had no lawful authority to issue a citation. But respondent's unlawful arrest was not a clearly established constitutional violation, and petitioner officer was entitled to immunity on that claim. State qualified immunity did not, however, bar respondents' state law tort claims. Since there were no recognized exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search or intrusion into respondent's residence, and his due process right to be free of arrest by excessive force was clearly established, the dismissal of his excessive force and illegal search and seizure claims was error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Defendant convicted of several counts of first degree assault and one count of conspiracy to commit first degree assault was not entitled to have his full offender score applied to the conspiracy offense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b), which would result in a lower overall sentence due to the 75 percent rule of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.595, because the full offender score applied to the offense with the highest seriousness level under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.515, a seriousness level is not specified by &sect; 9.94A.515 for conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and no provision is made in &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b) for arriving at a higher seriousness level when &sect; 9.94A.595 applies; [2]-In their current form, the gang-related conditions of community custody were unconstitutionally vague and must be stricken, clarified, or narrowed at resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drive-by shooting convictions were reversed, the other convictions were affirmed, the trial court's application of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The school district's policy requiring a staff member who takes a drug or medication, whether or not prescribed, which may adversely affect that staff member's ability to perform work in a safe or productive manner, to report such use to his or her supervisor should not have been invalidated under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.570(2)(c) because it was not unconstitutionally vague; [2]-Substantial evidence supported the hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law that the teacher violated the reporting requirement; [3]-The sanction of a 15-day unpaid suspension and a 3-year drug testing requirement was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.405.340; [4]-The superior court's award of attorney fees and costs to the teacher under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.405.350 was unsupported by required findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's judgment and order and its award of attorney fees and costs were reversed, the hearing officer's decision upholding the district's probable cause determination and the sanction imposed were reinstated, and the teacher's request for attorney fees and costs on appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>
