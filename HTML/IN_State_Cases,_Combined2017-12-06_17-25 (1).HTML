<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief challenging his conviction and death sentence for the murder of three people. Defendant claimed that his appellate counsel labored under a conflict of interest because he was appointed to represent both defendant, and a co-defendant, and did not focus on co-defendant's involvement in the crime. To prevail on the claim that his appellate counsel labored under a conflict of interest, defendant was required to demonstrate that his counsel had an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected counsel's performance. The mere possibility of a conflict was not sufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. Moreover, joint representation was not per se evidence of ineffective assistance. Rather, defendant was required to show that his counsel's representation was fully inadequate. Denial of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief affirmed. Because defendant did not demonstrate how his defense was adversely affected by his counsel's performance or by his counsel's dual representation, defendant's ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indiana Legislature passed a statute purporting to abolish a state superior court in which plaintiff was the sitting judge. Plaintiff filed suit, challenging the constitutionally of the law as a violation of the separation of powers. On appeal, the court found the law unconstitutional, reasoning that any attempt by the legislature to abolish a superior court in the middle of a judge's term interfered with the judicial power of the courts and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. Under the Indiana Constitution, the legislature had the power to create and abolish superior courts, but to do so in the middle of a judge's term violated the separation of powers provision of the Indiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 4-21.5-5-4 was written in terms of waiver, not jurisdiction; [3]-If appellee employer did not preserve timeliness by not raising it as an affirmative defense, the court could still consider it because Ind. Code &sect; 4-21.5-5-4(b) let it find the employee waived judicial review; [4]-The employee was not entitled to show good cause for his untimely filing because Ind.

Code &sect; 34-30-15-23, and, thus, the anti-injunction provision in Ind. Code &sect; 34-30-15-18 was applicable; harm to professional reputation was not the kind of irreparable injury that formed the basis for equitable relief; and the cardiologist failed to exhaust his administrative remedies available in the peer review process, foreclosing a review of the likelihood of success on the merits of the cardiologist's multiple claims.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 23 because the Indiana Tort Claims Act applied equally to all claims and incidents; [3]-The aggregate cap did not classify tort victims, but only occurrences, and the Indiana Legislature could properly decide that occurrences that generated over 5 million dollars in liability placed too great a burden on the treasury.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22-3-6-1(a) had been amended to state that both a lessor and lessee of employees were considered joint employers; [2]-The reference to lessor and lessee in &sect; 22-3-6-1(a) was not intended to be a term of art that excluded temporary employees; [3]-The temporary employee's exclusive remedy against both the employer and the leasing company was under the Indiana Workers' Compensation Act; [4]-Interpreting the term &quot;leased employees&quot; to include &quot;temporary employees&quot; did not render &sect; 22-3-6-1(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-In an appeal challenging the award of punitive damages in a medical malpractice action, Ind. Code &sect; 34-51-3-6 (2013) did not permit the State to intervene in an otherwise private litigation at any stage of the proceedings because it had no rights or duties implicated in the physician/patient relationship and the statute did not provide that the State become a party or judgment creditor at the time the verdict was announced, nor did it specifically provide for its intervention; [2]-Pursuant to &sect; 34-51-3-6(e), at the time the damages verdict was announced, the State's interest could best be described as a mere expectancy, contingent on the future payment of the award and, in all respects, derivative of the patient's right to receive payment; [3]-The appeal warranted dismissal because the only proper parties to the appeal had amicably resolved their dispute.</SPAN></P>

The animal control officer testified that the fence had obvious gaps through which the dogs could escape. The evidence further showed that defendant kept the third dog in her unfenced backyard, with only a loose collar through which his head easily slipped. The dogs escaped and bit two victims. Given the evidence, the trial court could reasonably infer that defendant failed to take reasonable steps to restrain the dogs in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 15-20-1-4.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was not an adjudicative act because it was prospective and general in nature, purported to regulate only future conduct, and was generally and equally applicable to all property owners within its boundaries.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.5(g), which made applicant ineligible to petition for a change of status, was an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to him. The 2007 amendments were punitive as applied because applicant could no longer petition to change his status due to the fact that he had two unrelated convictions for sex offenses.</SPAN></P>

Further, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the victim's credibility by stating that she was confident that the jury would come to the same conclusion that she and the police detectives had determined. The court was further unable to say that the combined effect of the errors was harmless. Defendant contended that there was otherwise insufficient evidence to convict him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Tippecanoe Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted him of Class A felony neglect of a dependent under Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State elicited testimony by a physician that the child victim experienced abusive head trauma. Defendant contended that it was improper expert testimony concerning his guilt. The court disagreed. The witness testified that the child's injury was most likely an abusive head trauma but did not testify that she believed defendant was responsible. The State later asked the witness whether, hypothetically speaking, dropping the child while she was being tossed into the air would change the doctor's ultimate conclusion regarding abuse or neglect. Defendant objected to that question and the trial court sustained the objection, so the witness was prevented from commenting on that ultimate conclusion. Accordingly, the court could not find an abuse of discretion. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to convict under Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-4(a) because defendant's mother had warned him not to throw the child in the air because she was afraid the child would be hurt. Thus, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant was subjectively aware of a high probability that he placed the child in a dangerous situation by tossing the wet child into the air over a bathtub.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Clark Superior Court (Indiana) of five counts of Child Molesting, as Class A felonies under Ind.

Code &sect; 35-42-4-6. She was sentenced to an aggregate consecutive term of sixty years imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that her sentence, imposing upon her a total of 60 years in prison, was inappropriate under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B). The court of appeals agreed. Defendant was convicted of five counts of Child Molestation, as Class A felonies, three counts of Child Molestation, as Class C felonies, and one count of Child Solicitation, as a Class D felony. The trial court imposed the advisory sentence for each offense, running some sentences concurrently and others consecutively to arrive at an aggregated term of imprisonment of sixty years. The court held that defendant's lack of prior criminal record, generally good conduct in the community, and lack of substantial physical harm to her victims made an executed aggregate sixty year sentence inappropriate. Thus, as to the first of the two groups of sentences, the court reduced the Class A felonies to the statutory minimum term of twenty years. The court left undisturbed the second group of sentences at the thirty year advisory term, but ordered the final ten years suspended. This left defendant with an aggregate sentence of fifty years, with ten years suspended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hendricks Superior Court (Indiana) that convicted him of six counts of sexual misconduct and child molestation under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-42-4-9 and 35-42-4-3, arguing that law enforcement procured statements from him in violation of his constitutional right to counsel and that the aggregate 40-year term imposed was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was in jail on another charge, law enforcement enlisted his stepdaughter to call him and elicit incriminating statements regarding his molestation of her, and the calls were recorded. Based upon the evidence obtained, defendant was charged with misconduct and child molestation. On review of his convictions, the court held that defendant's right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13, was not violated because the right to counsel was offense-specific and attached only after adversarial proceedings had commenced. Although defendant had been charged and had hired counsel in an unrelated case, he had not been charged with sexual misconduct and child molestation when the subject phone calls took place. Accordingly, defendant's right to counsel as to those charges had not attached, and the investigatory phone calls were permissible and did not violate his right to counsel. Further, the enhanced, consecutive sentences were appropriate because defendant took advantage of his underage stepdaughter repeatedly over the course of several years and exploited a position of trust, and instructed the victim not to disclose the sexual abuse to anyone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought to have his sentence of life without parole vacated and a term of years imposed. He contended that he was entitled to that remedy because his sentence violated Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(a). Appellant's argument presupposed that he was mentally retarded; however, after hearing evidence from co-workers, two court-appointed experts and one defense expert, the trial court in appellant's pretrial hearing found that he was not, in fact, mentally retarded. Also, an attorney was not reasonably expected to review the transcripts of prior cases involving his or her client to discern possible bias on the part of the judge presiding in the matter for which the attorney was currently providing representation. Furthermore, appellant did not show that he was mentally retarded under Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-2 because the evidence of his adaptive functioning did not suggest significant deficits, as he was capable of self-care, social relationships, employment, and holding a driver's license. Thus, under the Sixth Amendment, his attorneys were not ineffective. Therefore, appellant was not entitled to postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Fayette Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted him of dealing in a schedule III controlled substance, as a Class A felony, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-2(b)(2) (2008) and for being an habitual offender in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that defendant's offense was a Class A felony because defendant delivered the substance within 1,000 feet of school property in violation of &sect; 35-48-4-2(b). Defendant asserted that the statute provided him a defense because he was only within 1,000 feet of the school &quot;briefly.&quot; The court upheld the decision. The court held that defendant was not entitled to his proffered jury instruction regarding the issue because there was no evidence in the record that supported giving the instruction. Contrary to his contentions, the &quot;briefly&quot; language related to defendant's presence in the proscribed zone and not to the length of the transaction. The evidence unequivocally demonstrated that defendant was not &quot;briefly&quot; within 1,000 feet of school property when he illegally sold a controlled substance from his residence. There was also sufficient evidence to support the conviction because a county surveyor measured from the front of defendant's house and measured over to the back door of the actual school building. The distance between those two points and was 811 feet. However, there was insufficient evidence to show defendant was a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was upheld except that defendant's classification as a habitual offender was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Incarcerated following convictions of marijuana possession and child molestation, the inmate filed a grievance, complaining that he had completed his sentence and yet remained incarcerated and seeking immediate release. A reviewing court found merit to the inmate's grievance and ordered his immediate release in November of 2004. In May of 2005, the inmate filed a tort notice claim and, in July of 2006, filed a complaint alleging false arrest and false imprisonment. On review of summary judgment granted in favor of the sheriff and the correctional facility, the court held that summary judgment was proper because the tort claim notice period expired before the inmate filed his notice. The Indiana Tort Claims Act (ITCA) barred tort claims against a political subdivision unless notice of a tort claim is filed within 180 days after the loss occurs pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-8(a); the inmate was aware of the wrongful nature of his continued incarceration before his release, and as such, the notice period was not tolled under Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant knew that he did not have the victim's consent to videotape her naked or engaging in sexual intercourse with him. While the victim was sleeping, defendant videotaped himself taking the victim's clothes off, and he initiated sexual intercourse with her. Defendant argued that the voyeurism statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-4-5, was unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals disagreed. Spouses and significant others expected that they would see one another disrobing at regular intervals, and, under most circumstances, participants in such relationships impliedly consented to being seen without clothes on. But that was not to say that &quot;peeping&quot; was categorically permissible in such relationship settings. The &quot;looking&quot; that was proscribed was &quot;any looking of a clandestine, surreptitious, prying, or secretive nature.&quot; The victim was upset, and when she tried to grab the video camera, defendant took it and tried to prevent the victim from getting it. Defendant knew that he did not have the victim's consent at the time that he videotaped her, and thus, that he knowingly videotaped her in a clandestine manner in an area where she was likely to disrobe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 911 caller reported that a blue Volkswagen was driving erratically. The caller saw the car pull into a gas station and notified police. He identified himself and provided his number. When officers arrived, they noticed a blue Volkswagen pulling out of a parking spot. Defendant was stopped, investigated, and arrested. The court agreed with the State that the 911 caller was an identified informant or concerned citizen, as opposed to an anonymous tipper, and, thus, the tip was a circumstance which bore in favor of reasonable suspicion. However, the court further concluded that the police failed to couple the concerned citizen's tip with corroborative investigation. The sole witness called by the State was a police officer who testified that he did not know whether another blue car, or another Volkswagen was parked in the gas station parking lot at the time defendant's vehicle was stopped. There was no evidence presented that another officer checked to be sure that defendant's vehicle was the only vehicle at the gas station that matched the description given by the 911 caller.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana) found defendant guilty of 16 counts of Class D felony voyeurism under Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-4-5 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2010). Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of 18 years, with a total of six years executed and 12 years suspended to probation. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness saw defendant holding a video camera at waist-level, stepping in and out of an arched doorway in a common shower area in a gym on a university campus. The witness testified that defendant appeared to be hiding in the shadows. From that, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was looking at the witness in a clandestine, surreptitious, prying, or secretive manner. Further, the videotape evidence presented at trial clearly showed defendant videotaping men urinating through a peephole while hiding in a restroom stall. The jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was looking at those men in a clandestine, surreptitious, prying, or secretive manner and did so with a camera. The evidence was sufficient to show that defendant committed Class D felony voyeurism under Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-4-5 because defendant peeped into a shower and a public restroom and he used a camera to commit voyeurism. In addition, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress or in admitting the evidence found on the videotape or during the search of defendant's home. Finally, defendant's sentence was not inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a fatal accident and was transported to the hospital because of his injuries. A police officer responded to the hospital and read defendant the implied consent law under Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-7-3, which pertained to his being the driver of a vehicle involved in a fatal accident. Defendant was advised that if he refused to submit to a chemical test then his driving privileges would be suspended for two years because he had a prior conviction for OWI. He was further advised that a refusal would be a Class C infraction or a Class A infraction if he had a prior conviction for OWI. Defendant then consented to the chemical test and signed a consent form for a voluntary blood draw. The court held that the consensual chemical test was reasonable under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and the results were properly admitted into evidence because the threat of the punishment did not make defendant's consent involuntary. However, the conviction was reversed and remanded because the State failed to present evidence beyond mere intoxication in order to prove the element of endangerment of another person and support a conviction of OWI as a Class A misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed with regard to the admission of the blood test, but reversed and remanded with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Jennings Circuit Court (Indiana) found defendant guilty of attempted dealing in methamphetamine, two counts of possession of a precursor while in possession of a firearm, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of marijuana under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-48-4-1, 35-41-5-1, 35-48-4-14.5(b), 35-48-4-6, 35-48-4-11, and found him to be a habitual offender under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8. He appealed his convictions and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony of a deputy, a detective, and a trooper could establish the identity and quantity of the substances at trial because the officers were sufficiently experienced with methamphetamine and the substances involved in the manufacturing of the drug. The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the five charged offenses because (1) defendant possessed at least 252 decongestant pills containing pseudoephedrine; (2) defendant possessed anhydrous ammonia as the deputy and the detective observed a white cloud and smelled the distinct odor of anhydrous ammonia when they destroyed tanks believed to contain that chemical; (3) the weight of the pseudoephedrine found was approximately 30.25 grams; (4) the officers found methamphetamine residue on a casino card, a plate, aluminum boats, and hollowed out light bulbs and defendant also admitted that he was an addict; and (5) the detective stated that the green, leafy substance was marijuana and defendant admitted to smoking marijuana. Finally, defendant's 40-year aggregate sentence was not inappropriate in light of defendant's offenses of manufacturing and attempting to sell methamphetamine and defendant's prior criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded to the trial court to correct the sentencing order to reflect that defendant was sentenced to 15 years for his Class B felony conviction, enhanced by 25 years for the habitual offender finding resulting in a total sentence of 40 years executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Indiana as a relator on behalf of a resident, sought review of a decision of the Cass Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed its action against appellees, the City of Logansport and the City of Logansport Parks and Recreation Board. The resident had set forth the action by alleging that a park had not been operated and managed in accordance with the directives of a will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the action and that it should have granted his motion for summary judgment in its entirety because the City's response to the summary judgment motion did not comply with the designation of evidence requirements of Ind. R. Trial P. 56(C). Thus, he claimed that the City had waived its statute of limitations argument and all other defenses because it failed to raise those defenses in response to his motion for summary judgment. The decision was upheld. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in part regarding the issue of standing and the validity of a resolution and the provisions of the will that related to the park. However, the trial court expressly reserved its ruling on the statute of limitations issue until the hearing on the motion to dismiss. It was determined that the City asserted that defense in its answer and in the motion to dismiss and that the resident did not assert or discuss the applicability of any statute of limitations provision in the motion for summary judgment. Thus, there was no waiver of the statute of limitations defense, and the City had standing to use the defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel wanted to present expert testimony concerning false or coerced confessions. The expert at issue was a licensed clinical psychologist who had practiced for 20 years and had testified as an expert 50 times. However, he had never been qualified as an expert on coerced confessions. At the time of the hearing on the admissibility of the testimony, the expert had not yet conducted any testing of defendant, but if his testimony were to be admissible, he would have to examine defendant to determine if he had any personality traits that would make him susceptible to police influence and whether the police interrogation was psychologically coercive. The expert had examined five other defendants for the possibility of false confession but had not found any evidence those confessions were coerced. The trial court declined to allow the testimony on the basis that it would not assist the triers of fact to understand scientific, technical, or specialized evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Although the expert testimony should have been admitted, the error was harmless because there was enough evidence to support the conviction regardless of the expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission asserted that the trial court erred in striking its demand for a jury trial as a valid election to move the case to the trial court, under Ind. Code &sect; 22-9-1-16 was not made, and, because it was not, Ind. Code &sect; 22-9-1-17(c), which prohibited a jury trial, was not triggered.  The corporation argued that a valid election was made pursuant to the commission's rule 2, 1-2.6, and that as a result, the commission's request for a jury trial was specifically prohibited by &sect; 22-9-1-17(c), which stated that a civil action filed under that section had to be tried without a jury. The court held that, pursuant to &sect; 22-9-1-12.1(b), local commissions could not create rules inconsistent with statute. Here, rule 2, 1-2.6, which allowed any party to a case before the commission to elect to proceed before a court of competent jurisdiction, was inconsistent with &sect; 22-9-1-16, which required that both the respondent and the complainant to agree in writing to have claims before the commission decided in a court of law. Therefore, rule 2, 1-2.6 was invalid. Accordingly, the parties failed to comply with proper procedural requirements and the trial court could not exercise its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
