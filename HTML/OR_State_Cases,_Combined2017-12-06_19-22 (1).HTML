<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lane County Circuit Court, Oregon, sustained a final order by respondent Lane County Board of County Commissioners (county) that legalized a county road and denied appellant landowner compensation under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the reviewing court erred in concluding that the county's order was supported by substantial evidence and that the order properly construed the applicable law. The appellate court noted that the appeal was from a judicial review of the same county road legalization proceeding and, consequently, under the law of the case doctrine, it did not address any argument that the parties advanced concerning the dispute over the location of the road or where it may or may not have existed at any one time. The appellate court did not reach the landowner's contention that the reviewing court erred in concluding that the county had authority to proceed with the legalization as that issued had already been decided. The reviewing court did not err in concluding that the county decision was constitutional as the county had used and maintained the road as a public road for at least 40 years. Even if the legalization process effected a taking, that would not make it unlawful and would merely give the landowner a compensatory remedy. The record before the county was insufficient to establish a right to compensation under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 368.211.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At 11:45 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day, an officer observed several cars in the parking lot of a closed park and five or six people milling about. He believed that the group had been drinking alcoholic beverages based on observing several beer bottles strewn about 10 feet from the group. Another officer arrived and said that persons in the group had been at a recent shooting. The arresting officer asked the group to sit on the ground and whether they had any weapons. Defendant consented to a search, and the officer found the brass knuckles. The court held that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain defendant under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The officer did not observe defendant in actual possession of any of the beer cans nor did he smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage on the breath of defendant or any member of the group. There were insufficient circumstances from which it could be reasonably inferred that defendant exercised dominion or control over the containers so as to constitute constructive possession of them. The containers could have been placed by any member of the public. The officer lacked authority to detain defendant, vitiating his consent to the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the former partner of respondent mother, sought a declaration that she was a legal parent of two children born to the mother during their same-sex relationship. The Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, dismissed petitioner's claims for failure to state a claim for relief, and petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both children were conceived through artificial insemination, and petitioner alleged that she consented. The court of appeals held that the presumption provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.243--that a husband was the parent of a child conceived by artificial insemination--violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because it was not available to same-sex couples, who could not marry. The court saw no justification for denying that privilege on the basis of sexual orientation, particularly given that same-sex couples could become legal coparents through adoption. There was no reason to permit heterosexual couples but not same-sex couples to bypass adoption. The appropriate remedy was to extend the statute so that it applied when the same-sex partner of the biological mother consented to the artificial insemination. The court also held that Measure 36 did not limit the legal benefits associated with marriage to heterosexual couples and therefore had no application in the current case. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.070, which created a presumption as to who was the biological parent of a child, did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for entry of judgment on first claim for relief and for further proceedings on second claim for relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Washington County Circuit Court (Oregon) of unlawful possession of methamphetamine. The trial court had denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded for further fact finding. A traffic infraction led to a car being stopped. The officer initiated an investigation against the driver. That investigation, including the officer's authority to question defendant pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 810.410, concluded when the officer arrested the driver. From that point forward, for purposes of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, the officer was required to have some independent basis for detaining defendant. Given that the officer asked defendant to get out of the car, he did not tell defendant he was free to go, and there was no evidence showing that the officer made defendant aware that he was being approached as part of the officer's investigation of the driver, if defendant believed that he was not free to leave, that belief would have been reasonable. However, the court was unable to determine from the record whether defendant held such a belief because the trial court made no findings regarding defendant's subjective belief that he had been seized. Remand was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and remanded. If the trial court found that defendant did not believe that he was the subject of a criminal investigation and was therefore unable to leave, the trial court should reinstate defendant's conviction. If the court determined that defendant did subjectively hold that belief, however, the evidence at issue had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Lane County Circuit Court (Oregon) of two counts of rape in the first degree, four counts of sodomy in the first degree, two counts of unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree, and three counts of sexual abuse in the first degree. He was sentenced to a total of 400 months' incarceration followed by lifetime post-prison supervision (PPS). Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(b)(D) to (F) in combination with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.103(2), which together required the trial court to impose mandatory sentences of 300 months' incarceration with mandatory lifetime PPS for each rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse conviction when the victim was under the age of 12. Defendant argued that, because the penalty for intentional murder--300 months' incarceration without mandatory lifetime PPS--was less severe than the penalty that he received for each of seven counts of which he was convicted, the latter penalties were unconstitutionally disproportionate in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court held the sentence was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to his crime because it did not shock the moral sense. A proportionality review did not involve comparing the penalty for one crime with the penalty for another crime, except in cases in which the penalty for a lesser-included offense was greater than the penalty for the greater crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.400, petitioner inmate challenged the validity of Or. Admin. R. 255-030-0026, Or. Admin. R. 255-032-0015, Or. Admin. R. 255-035-0023(1), and Or. Admin. R. 255-040-0025 regarding aspects of parole hearings for inmates convicted of murder and aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that Or. Admin. R. 255-030-0026, Or. Admin. R. 255-032-0015, Or. Admin. R. 255-035-0023(1), and Or. Admin. R. 255-040-0025 were unconstitutional because they treated individuals convicted of aggravated murder more favorably than individuals convicted of murder. Upon review, the court determined that in the case of convicted murderers who were sentenced to less than 20 years in prison under the version of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(3)(c) in effect between 1985 and 1989, the inmate's arguments regarding disparate treatment of parole after 20 years were inapposite. For some convicted murderers, the rules did not operate unconstitutionally, even under the inmate's construct. For that reason, the court concluded that the inmate's contention that those rules operated unconstitutionally, though styled as a rule challenge under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.400, was truly an as-applied challenge that depended on the particular facts of the inmate's case. Accordingly, the court held that the rules were valid and rejected the inmate's rule challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Crook County Circuit Court (Oregon), which convicted him of possession of a controlled substance, under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992 (2003), renumbered as Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.840 (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assigned error to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. IV which was discovered by opening an eyeglass case during an inventory of his car. Defendant argued that the police department's applicable inventory policy was overbroad because it required police to inventory the contents of all closed containers, not just those likely to contain valuables. On appeal, the court found that even if a city's ordinance did not repeal or replace the police department's policy, it was axiomatic that the police department policy was invalid at least to the extent that it conflicted with the ordinance. Thus, the policy provided no basis for the inventory of defendant's car as it conflicted with the city's ordinance and was invalid. The city ordinance unambiguously required opening all closed, unlocked containers. Although a limitation on the scope of inventories could easily have been included, one was not included. Because the ordinance required police to open all closed containers, it was overbroad and thus, the evidence discovered in the inventory should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, ruled that a letter sent by defendant insurer to plaintiff insured, and a subsequent notice, formally instituted arbitration proceedings; therefore the two-year limitation period was tolled, during which the insured had to act in order to preserve his cause of action, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. 742.504(12)(a)(B). The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured had an automobile policy with the insurer. The policy contained underinsured (UIM) coverage. The insured was injured in an accident that he alleged was caused by another driver. The insurer sent two letters to the insured. One acknowledged the insured's UIM claim and stated that if there was a disagreement on the liability/damages owed by the underinsured motorist, the insurer consented to submit this matter to binding arbitration. The second letter stated that the insured disagreed about the extent of damages owed. The appellate court was called upon to decide whether the insurer formally instituted arbitration proceedings, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 742.504(12)(a)(B), by sending to the letters to the insured. In sum, the insurer's letters to the insured did not formally institute arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, because the insured did not perform any of the acts that could have tolled the running of the two-year limitation period for filing a UIM claim against the insurer, the trial court erred in granting the insured the relief that he sought.</SPAN></P>

On review, the city contended that LUBA did not properly construe the term &quot;area of land&quot; as used in 2005, Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's facility was within the urban growth boundary of the Metropolitan Service District (Metro). The city adopted Beaverton, Or., Ordinance 4350, in which, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.750, it annexed five contiguous tax lots owned by the property owner without the property owner's consent, four of which were zoned for industrial use and one for residential use. The property owner submitted a petition for a minor boundary change, requesting the withdrawal of only the four industrial-zoned lots from the city. The city denied the petition. LUBA reversed that order concluding that 2005, Or. Laws 844, &sect; 6 (SB 887) had the legal effect of prohibiting the city's annexation of the property. As observed by LUBA, the city engaged in an evaluation and concluded that its comprehensive plan was consistent with denial of the property owner's petition for a boundary change. The city's denial qualified as a land use decision and, therefore, pursuant to ORS 197.015(10)(a)(A), LUBA had exclusive jurisdiction. The court held that it was of no moment that the business in question may own additional property that did not qualify for exemption under &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Washington County Circuit Court (Oregon) that convicted him of disorderly conduct in the second degree under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove that he engaged in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant walked past a gas station, he kicked a sandwich-board-style &quot;Help Wanted&quot; sign off of the sidewalk and into the middle the road. When the station owner approached defendant, defendant turned toward him, made a fist, and repeatedly punched his fist into his other hand. Feeling threatened, the station owner backed away and called the police. Defendant was charged with two counts of disorderly conduct, one for kicking the sign and the other for his threatening gestures. At trial, the trial court granted defendant's motion for acquittal on the charge based upon the threatening gestures but denied the motion regarding the remaining charge. On review, the court rejected defendant's contention that his conduct was not a proscribed physical act of aggression because it was not directed against any person. Defendant's act of kicking the sign constituted the use of physical force; he kicked the sign hard enough that it landed in the middle of the road, demonstrating the use of strength and power. It was not merely incidental conduct; defendant did not kick the sign to gain someone's attention but kicked the sign because he was frustrated that it blocked the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While petitioners' appeal was pending, the voters passed Ballot Measure 49, which amended Measure 37 and added provisions that altered the claims and remedies available to landowners whose property values were adversely affected by land use regulations, Or.

The appellate court determined that the cooperative and petitioners would appear to have, at the very lease, the ability to seek declaratory or injunctive relief concerning the cooperative's rights under Measure 49. There was nothing in Measure 49 that would prevent the cooperative or petitioners from litigating the validity of the Measure 37 waiver as part of a separate proceeding to determine the cooperative's rights under Measure 49, whether that proceeding was at the local level or in a circuit court. The parties would not be precluded from again litigating its validity in a subsequent proceeding to establish the cooperative's rights under Measure 49. A determination by the appellate court as to the validity of the underlying waiver would not conclusively resolve the merits of any claim to just compensation under Measure 49.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally convicted in the trial court on 29 counts of various sex crimes. Several convictions were reversed on appeal and the case was remanded for resentencing, at which time the trial court increased the sentence on one of the counts. Defendant again appealed, and the court accepted one of the three grounds for the appeal. However, the Supreme Court of Oregon reversed and remanded to the court to consider the other grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the first appeal, count 19, a charge of first-degree criminal mistreatment under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.205, was affirmed. On the remand for resentencing, the trial court changed the sentence for count 19 from a consecutive 32-month term in prison to a consecutive 59 months in prison, with 36 months post-prison supervision. The upward departure sentence was based on facts found by the trial court, which constituted plain error under Blakely v. Washington. The court declined to exercise its discretion under Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc. to correct the error because, given the circumstances of defendant's crimes, a remand for resentencing would be gratuitous because the trial court could and would lawfully impose the same total sentence. The court considered and rejected defendant's argument that because count 19 had been affirmed in the first appeal, the trial court was not entitled to change the sentence on remand. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(5) (2001), in the event of an error requiring resentencing, the appellate court is required to remand the entire case for resentencing, and the sentencing court could impose a new sentence for any conviction in the remanded case.</SPAN></P>

In either case, the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 260.402 violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. As the U.S. Supreme Court had held that a law that required disclosure of a contributor's identity did not offend U.S. Const. amend.

One of the employer's owners testified that he understood a department employee had indicated that the employer's request for a hearing was valid and a bond was not required. On appeal, the employer argued that it was not required to satisfy the bond requirement. The employer contended that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in rejecting that the department granted the employer an open-ended extension of time within which to supply a deposit or bond pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657.683(1). The appellate court agreed with the department. The ALJ found that the employer failed to demonstrate that an extension or waiver was actually granted. Substantial evidence existed to support that finding. Further, events that took place after the hearing request were irrelevant. The hearing request was invalid, and subsequent events did not render the invalidity moot. The applicable statutes plainly provided the employer the opportunity to challenge the propriety of the department's notice of assessment at a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion in arrest of judgment. He argued that, under state law, local governments could not prohibit a person from carrying a loaded firearm within a car on a public street. The appellate court concluded that the text and context of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.173 unambiguously demonstrated that local governments were permitted to regulate the possession of loaded firearms on their streets and highways, regardless of whether those firearms were kept in a place to which the general public did not have access. Nothing in &sect; 166.173 or Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.015(10) supported defendant's contention that a loaded firearm, when carried in a public place, was outside the scope of local regulation merely because it was kept in a place to which the general public lacked access. When the legislature enacted &sect; 166.173, it intended to allow local governments to regulate the possession of loaded firearms on their streets and highways, even if such a firearm was kept in a place to which the general public had no access. Because PCC 14A.060.010 was consistent with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.173, defendant's motion in arrest for judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner challenged the portion of the decision rejecting his argument that respondent county violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 215.422(1)(c) and Crook County, Or., Code &sect; 18.172.050 by charging an excessive filing fee for the appeal of the conditional use approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner asserted that the assessment of an appeal fee violated both the ordinance and the statute and that the Board erroneously shifted the burden of producing evidence concerning the reasonableness of the fee from the county to petitioner. The court found that although in previous appeals petitioner complained that the appeal fee was excessive, he never made an evidentiary showing to support that argument, despite opportunities to do so. Petitioner also could have made a public records request to inspect the documents that formed the basis of the order that set the fee. However, he failed to avail himself of any opportunities to buttress his assertions with supporting evidence. In addition, the record did not disclose that petitioner made any effort to obtain evidence about the reasonableness of the fee from county officials. Petitioner's argument reduced to an assertion that the Board erred in allocating to petitioner the burden of producing evidence concerning the reasonableness of the fee. The court concluded that the Board did not so err and petitioner failed to meet his burden to establish a prima facie case that the fee violated either the ordinance or the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to suppress the evidence gathered after the initial stop, arguing that the officer illegally extended the stop by continuing to investigate him after seeing the license plate propped up behind the windshield. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the motion because the officer's belief that defendant had committed a traffic violation was objectively reasonable. Based on its text and context, &sect; 803.540(1)(b) required defendant to conspicuously exhibit his registration plate on the foremost part of his vehicle because: (1) &quot;the front&quot; of a vehicle was the foremost part of the vehicle and the registration plate had to be exhibited conspicuously on it; (2) in none of the other provisions of the vehicle code in which the phrase &quot;on the front of&quot; was used could it be construed to mean &quot;inside the front windshield;&quot; and (3) the legislature had expressly prohibited the placement of items on the windshield of a vehicle in Or.

The court originally affirmed without opinion because defendant had not preserved his assignment of error, pursuant to Or. R. App. P. 5.45(1). On reconsideration, the court held that defendant preserved his argument that the circuit court could not impose consecutive sentences under Or. Rev.

</DIV>

The court concluded that the Commission acted within the authority delegated to it by the legislature. The crab pot allocation system was consistent with the overarching statutory goal of promoting the equitable utilization of available food fish as pronounced by the legislature in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 506.109(3). The legislature expressly determined in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 508.921 that the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab fishery was overcapitalized. It directed the Commission to establish, by rule, a system for restricting participation in the fishery with the goal of, among other things, preventing a concentration of fishing effort. That was precisely what the Commission did when it adopted the allocation system at issue in this appeal. Further, other statutory provisions, individually and collectively, complemented - and did not contradict - the Commission's authority to promulgate the regulations challenged by petitioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the denial of the protester's motion for summary judgment did not present a reviewable claim of error. It could not review the protestor's constitutional contentions based on the less complete summary judgment record rather than on the full record from the trial. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31.150, the trial court's denial of the protester's special motion to strike was not subject to review on the appeal. The trial court did not err in refusing to give one of the protester's instructions as the court would have had to determine that the protester's characterization of his actions was correct as a matter of law. The protester did not assign error to any ruling in which the trial court refused to determine the meaning of his statements. The trial court correctly denied the protester's other proposed instructions. As to the dismissed defendants, the trial court had to enter findings on why it dismissed their motion for attorney fees under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20.105(1) and sanctions under Or. R. Civ. P. 17D. The trial court's order denying defendants' motion for leave to amend their motion for attorney fees was vacated.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 8. One text message from the husband used the word &quot;delightful.&quot; The wife became alarmed because her boyfriend, who had sexual intercourse with her the previous day at her residence with the window open, had commented to her on &quot;how delightful the afternoon was.&quot; Another text message used the word &quot;time out.&quot; According to the wife, this text message referred to a conversation she had with her boyfriend and her daughter the previous day in which she said she needed to take a time out. The court concluded that the evidence demonstrated that the husband had spied on the wife and lurked near her residence while she was inside.

Stat. &sect; 163.205(1)(a) against withholding necessary and adequate medical attention did not encompass the failure to disclose to medical personnel inculpatory information about the cause of a child's injuries. The court thus rejected the state's position that defendant's withholding of information constituted withholding of necessary and adequate medical attention within the meaning of Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the measure, which the voters enacted as Or. Const. art.

The constitutional changes wrought by the measure were not so fundamental and far reaching as to amount to a constitutional revision. The court also concluded that the measure did not violate the separate vote requirement of Or. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1. The court agreed with the State that the measure did only one thing: restrict marriage in Oregon to opposite-sex couples. Any incidental alterations made to the Oregon Constitution by the enactment of the measure were simply those necessary to effectuate that single, simple objective: the elimination of constitutional protections for, and authorizations of, same-sex marriage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When detectives went to the home of defendant and the co-defendant to investigate a complaint of drug activity, they saw bags of rotting garbage on the front porch and black mold growing across the interior of the front window. The co-defendant consented to the detectives entering the doorway to talk, and the detectives smelled garbage, feces, and mold. The detectives searched the home despite the co-defendant's refusal of consent. The detectives placed the child into protective custody and testified that they would have taken the child into protective custody no matter what was found during the search. The appellate court determined that suppression was warranted. The State did not prove the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 133.033 were met, because the detectives' warrantless search of the home was not reasonably necessary to prevent serious harm to the child and the conditions of the emergency aid doctrine were not satisfied since the detectives did not need to search the residence to find the child and the detectives had already decided to take the child into protective custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought judicial review of an order of respondent Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that denied his request for administrative review of an action deferring his release date for 24 months. The Board moved to dismiss the petition, asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction because the inmate failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Or. Admin. R. 255-080-0005(2)(b) was consistent with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.335(1)(b) where it provided that a request for review was timely if the United States Postal Service cancellation stamp was on or before the forty-fifth day, even if the request was not actually received until later. Additionally, the Oregon Department of Correction had complied with Or. Admin. R. 291-131-0015(5) by processing the inmate's request within two days of receipt. Or. Admin. R. 255-080-0005(2)(b) and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.335(1)(b) did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, as neither created a true class. Rather, the statute applied to all persons subject to the Board's jurisdiction, and all persons subject to jurisdiction had to exhaust administrative remedies. The statute and rule did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as using the postage cancellation date reasonably accommodated the government's legitimate interests in having reasonably ascertainable and documented mailing dates and the interests of inmates. The rule did not violate due process where the inmate failed to identify any meaningful risk of error that would have resulted from the continued use of the rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that prosecuting him for violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(b) violated the free expression guarantee of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The instant court concluded that the trial court necessarily found that the disorderly conduct statute was applied against defendant because of the noncommunicative elements of his speech. That enforcement did not violate defendant's rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The outcome of this case depended on whether defendant was arrested and convicted because of the volume, duration, place, or manner of his words, or because his words were obscene, offensive, annoying, alarming, or the like. At trial, the State presented witnesses who overheard defendant's speech, and their testimony referred to its volume, its location, and other noncontent elements. No witness testified that he or she was alarmed, inconvenienced, or annoyed by the words that defendant was using; they testified, rather, that the volume created a disturbance. The trial court did not base its ruling on the content of defendant's speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary, second-degree theft, and menacing. Roughly six months before the United States Supreme Court decided Blakely, the trial court imposed sentence. The trial court imposed a sentence of 90 months in prison on the robbery conviction and, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123, a consecutive sentence of 60 months on the burglary conviction. Defendant did not raise any constitutional objection to the trial court's imposition of a consecutive sentence. On appeal, he claimed that the consecutive sentence violated the rule announced in Blakely. The court decided to exercise its discretion to consider and correct the error in imposing the consecutive sentences. The determination of whether, given the totality of the circumstances, multiple offenses arose from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, &sect; 137.123(2), or whether defendant acted with the requisite willingness to commit more than one criminal offense, &sect; 137.123(5)(a), or whether there was the requisite risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury, or harm, &sect; 137.123(5)(b), was a matter of fact committed to the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged victim sued defendants, a Catholic archdiocese, an abbey, and a former priest, seeking to hold the priest directly liable for his sexual conduct and to hold the archdiocese and the abbey vicariously liable for that priest's and a deceased priest's conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) granted their summary judgment motions. The alleged victim appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged victim testified that, while the priest was sitting behind his desk in his office, he questioned the alleged victim, a freshman in high school, about his knowledge of sexuality and reproduction. During that discussion, the alleged victim saw motion under the priest's cassock. The alleged victim did not see whether the priest's hand was touching his skin, did not see the priest's genitals, did not see the priest's hand on his genitals, and did not perceive the priest achieving any form of sexual climax. Also, the priest did not proposition the alleged victim to participate in any way, did not touch him, did not ask him to do the same thing, and did not prevent him from leaving the priest's office. Additionally, the priest's conduct occurred on only one occasion and did not occur as part of a pattern of abuse. Thus, the incident with the priest did not constitute extreme or severe conduct constituting cruelty to the child for the purpose of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.117(2)(a)(B). Therefore, there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the priest's conduct was subject to the extended limitations period in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.117(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123(5), in circumstances involving multiple crimes arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, consecutive sentences were permitted if authorized by certain judicial findings. In State v. Ice, the Oregon Supreme Court held that such judicial factfinding violated the U.S. Constitution's Sixth Amendment. The state argued that State v. Ice was distinguishable from the case at hand because, given the nature of defendant's convictions as &quot;equally serious,&quot; the trial court could, as a matter of law, impose a consecutive sentence without engaging in any factfinding. The appellate court disagreed, reasoning that the State's premise was fundamentally flawed in that it assumed that consecutive sentences were authorized unless prohibited by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123(5). The opposite was true; in circumstances involving multiple crimes arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, consecutive sentences were prohibited unless authorized by &sect; 137.123(5). In sum, the trial court erroneously imposed a consecutive sentence pursuant to &sect; 137.123(5) based on impermissible judicial factfinding.</SPAN></P>

The movement was substantial because defendant the victim from a driveway to the inside of the vehicle's trunk. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's request to instruct the jury on second-degree robbery because the indictment did not set forth all of the elements required for second-degree robbery, as it did not allege that defendant represented by word or conduct that he was armed with what purported to be a dangerous or deadly weapon or was aided by another person actually present.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 163.115, 161.610 and two counts of felon in possession of a firearm in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270. He was sentenced and ordered to pay restitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his suppression motion, as well as his sentence. The court affirmed the convictions, but remanded for resentencing. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 146.107 authorized the deputy medical examiner to enter a trailer to examine the body and the examiner had a statutory duty to investigate and certify the cause and manner of the victim's death pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 146.090(1). This did not amount to an unreasonable search and seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9, given that there was probable cause and exigent circumstances. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.106, restitution was authorized if (1) the murder resulted in pecuniary damages to the victim's minor son, (2) the State presented evidence of the nature and amount of the child's pecuniary damages, and (3) the child suffered pecuniary damages. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.103(2), the State was required to prove some quantifiable and ascertainable damages that naturally flowed from the victim's death. The State failed to offer any evidence in that regard and the trial court thus erred in ordering restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing, as the record was insufficient to support the restitution order. Otherwise, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was involved in an automobile accident.

On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter back to the DMV. The driver had a right to a contested case proceeding under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.310(2)(a)(A) because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.100(1) required a hearing when the transportation department proposed to cancel or refused to renew a vehicle's title or registration, and the letters of the DMV to the driver unequivocally stated that the DMV was cancelling her title and would not renew her registration. The legislature intended the scope of the exception set out in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.310(2)(b) to be limited to the circumstances when the best way to determine whether or not the person has failed the test is to retake the test, and in this case, there was no test that driver could have retaken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sodomy of a fellow inmate and defendant currently challenged the imposition of an upward departure sentence. He argued that the aggravating factors on which the trial court predicated the upward departure sentence, which were the fact that prior criminal justice sanctions had not deterred defendant and that defendant had a history of institutional or prison disciplinary problems, were unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court affirmed, stating that even assuming, without deciding, that the operative language of the two departure factors might, as applied in some circumstances, be vague, there was no question that defendant fell within their indisputable core. Defendant committed his crime while incarcerated for other crimes; indeed, he had a lengthy criminal history. Given those circumstances, he could not plausibly claim that he lacked fair notice that he could be subject to enhanced punishment because prior criminal justice sanctions had not deterred him, or that the application of that standard to him was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated because a departure sentence was imposed based on the aggravating factor that defendant was &quot;on supervision,&quot; which was not specifically listed in Or. Admin. R. 213-008-0002(1). This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the State's argument regarding appealability and reviewability without discussion. Next, it determined that there was no due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. Or. Admin. R. 213-008-0002(1) permitted the imposition of departure sentences if substantial and compelling reasons existed to conclude that circumstances other than the elements of the crime itself made the crime somehow worse. In light of the plain meaning of the term &quot;aggravating&quot; and the totality of the context in which it was used, the term satisfied due process because it embodied an imprecise, but comprehensible normative standard. Further, Rule 213-008-0002(1) explicitly stated that the list of departure factors was nonexclusive, and the factor at issue here had long been recognized in Oregon case law. As such, defendant was presumed to know the law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, defendant assigned error to the admission of evidence that he had participated in an earlier theft from the same victim. The appellate court concluded that the evidence of the earlier theft was relevant to prove the fact that, before either incident, defendant had conceived a plan to steal the victim's property. That fact, in turn, was relevant to the contested issue of whether defendant participated in the robbery. The evidence that defendant participated in the October 2001 theft contributed significantly to the inference that, at least by the end of his 2001 visit to the victim's home, defendant had formulated a general plan to steal from the victim. The existence of that general plan supported the inference that defendant participated in the April 2002 robbery as well. Or. Evid. Code 404(3) was a rule of inclusion; thus, evidence that was relevant to the existence of a general plan was admissible unless defendant explicitly or implicitly conceded the plan's existence, which did not occur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Malheur County Circuit Court (Oregon) convicted defendant, upon his guilty plea of misdemeanor driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;813.010. It was defendant's fourth misdemeanor DUII. The trial court concluded that defendant's driving privileges had to be revoked pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.235(1)(b) (2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty and was subsequently convicted of misdemeanor DUII when he drove with a blood alcohol content of .27 percent. He had previously been convicted of DUII in 1976 and 1980 in Oregon. He also had been convicted of DUII in 1989 in California. At sentencing, the State argued that, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.235(1)(b) (2003), the trial court was required to permanently revoke defendant's driving privileges. On appeal, defendant renewed his argument that the statute did not apply to him because his current conviction was his fourth - and not his third - conviction for misdemeanor DUII. According to defendant, the plain meaning of the reference to a &quot;third&quot; conviction meant that there had to be two, and only two, prior convictions. However, the appellate court concluded that the phrasing of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.235(1)(b) (2003) was ambiguous but that resorting to the legislative history and other aids to statutory construction made it clear that the trial court did not err in interpreting the statute to require permanent revocation of defendant's driving privileges based on his three prior misdemeanor DUII convictions.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that (1) regardless of whether the search may have been initiated unlawfully, the evidence would not be suppressed because the defendant's failure to obey the officer's order posed a threat to safety; and (2) there was no principled distinction between admitting evidence of the defendant's refusal to obey the order and prosecuting the offense on the basis of that evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Linn County Circuit Court (Oregon), which, after a remand, convicted him of murder and being a felon in possession of a firearm (FIP).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999, defendant was tried and found guilty of murder and FIP. He received an upward departure on the FIP conviction, which was not challenged on appeal. The murder conviction was reversed and remanded for a new trial. After he was again convicted of murder, the trial court sentenced defendant under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(5)(a), (b). This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court held that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was not implicated based on the time between defendant's successful first appeal and the retrial of the case. Under Turner's analysis of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.020, the trial court did not err by imposing the sentence prescribed by the existing version of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(5)(b). The trial court had no discretion in sentencing defendant; it was required to follow the amendment to &sect; 163.115(5), which did not violate ex post facto protections. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(5) (2003), the trial court had the authority to hear the Blakely arguments to the FIP sentence since the original judgment was reversed and remanded; the reasons for the upward departure were inextricably interrelated to the circumstances of the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.247(1)(b) was neither facially overbroad nor facially vague. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in disallowing her demurrer that challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 162.247(1) for overbreadth and vagueness. The instant court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Next, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion in arrest of judgment because the statute was vague as applied to her. Defendant had not cited a specific provision of the state or federal constitution in support of the assignment of error or otherwise developed her constitutional argument. Therefore, the instant court declined to address the assignment on its merits. Finally, defendant argued that &sect; 162.247(1)(b) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and principles of due process. Defendant did not preserve that argument at trial, nor did she raise it in her appellant's brief in the instant court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). The Lane County Circuit Court (Oregon) sentenced her to probation and suspended her driving privileges under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.428(2)(b) for three years. Defendant appealed, arguing that a previous Arizona DUII conviction should not have been counted for the purpose of computing the suspension period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly used her prior out-of-state DUII conviction to impose a three-year suspension of her driving privileges because for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.428--which established schedules of suspension or revocation periods applicable &quot;upon conviction for the offense&quot;--the word &quot;offense&quot; meant Oregon offenses only. Thus, defendant contended that the trial court should have imposed a one-year suspension under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.428(2)(a). However, the appellate court noted that under its precedents: (1) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.400(1), which required the suspension of the driving privileges of a person convicted of DUII, applied to both Oregon and out-of-state DUII convictions; (2) because &sect; 813.400(1) gave effect to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.428, the term &quot;offense&quot; as used in &sect; 809.428 necessarily included out-of-state offenses as well; and (3) specifically, Arizona's misdemeanor DUII statute was substantially similar to Oregon's. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in considering defendant's Arizona DUII conviction for purposes of calculating the length of her license suspension.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that while Or. Rev.

The trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional rights by initially playing the English-language recordings at trial without a contemporaneous interpretation. Any error by the trial court in allowing the Spanish-speaking police officer to summarize Spanish-language telephone calls was harmless as the officer's testimony regarding statements made by a person other than defendant or a codefendant had little, if anything, to do with the charges against defendant. Defendant's convictions based on his conduct involving one victim merged into one conviction for attempted aggravated murder and his conduct involving another victim merged into a second conviction for attempted aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's counsel and the prosecutor negotiated a plea bargain containing two parts.

Second, defendant agreed to be tried as an adult for attempted rape in the first degree and to plead guilty, with the proviso that a conviction would not be entered and he would not be sentenced if he complied with certain conditions of probation. Defendant was found to have violated his probation and was found to have failed to meet the conditions of his plea agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis for the conviction was defendant's entering the grounds of a public school after the school's principal had told him not to enter. Defendant traveled to various schools in order to preach and to pass out religious literature to students as they arrived for classes. Defendant tried to position himself on the city sidewalk so that he was in the center of the area where the school buses arrived but was not directly in front of any of the bus doors. That location put defendant close to the arriving students but did not interfere with their access to the school. Defendant asserted that he was engaged in constitutionally protected conduct on public property and that any attempt to exclude him was unlawful. The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal under the First Amendment. The school grounds were not a public forum. The school used its property for school purposes, and defendant's activity was not part of that use. Unlike the sidewalk, the walkway between the school entrance and the sidewalk was not a public thoroughfare but was designed for those who were entering and leaving the school.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for arson in the first degree for intentionally damaging the property of another under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.325(1)(a) (2003). Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. The Josephine County Circuit Court, Oregon, denied defendant's motion. Defendant was subsequently found guilty, sentenced, and ordered to pay $ 33,327.52 in restitution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove past his ex-girlfriend's house and observed her new boyfriend's vehicle. Defendant drove to the rental house where he knew the new boyfriend lived and entered through an unlocked back door. Once inside, defendant found some flares. Defendant used two flares to set the house on fire. The resulting conflagration sent a dangerous amount of smoke and carbon monoxide into a small house approximately 14 feet from the back of the boyfriend's house and connected to it by a roof over a carport. At the time, nobody was in the boyfriend's house, but the second house was occupied. Although that occupant's property was damaged, she escaped without injury. The appellate court disagreed with defendant's argument that the mental state set out in the statute, &quot;intentionally,&quot; carried over to the subcategory fact, and that because the State did not prove that he intended to cause serious physical injury, he should have been acquitted. An offense-subcategory fact was not an element of an offense to which a culpable mental state must apply by virtue of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.095(2) or 161.115(1), at least when the fact was not described in the statute itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The appellate court found that defendant was afforded the opportunity to refuse to consent to the search of his computer. Nothing demonstrated that the officers' conduct preceding and surrounding the request to search created a sufficiently coercive environment so as to render defendant's consent involuntary. The evidence demonstrated that the search of defendant's computer did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;9 or the Fourth Amendment. The circumstances in which defendant made his pre-Miranda statements were not sufficiently compelling to violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;12 or the Fifth Amendment. A factfinder could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the images were of actual children actually engaged in the conduct depicted. The evidence was sufficient to permit an inference that defendant had the required mental state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Clatsop County Circuit Court, Oregon, of 199 counts of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree, in violation of Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the statute under which he was convicted, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.684, violated his right to free expression under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The instant court concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.684 did not punish expression. The dissemination of the depiction of the child sexual abuse was more than mere expression, but was further exploitative conduct that occurred after the abuse took place. The State was not required to prove that the underlying sexual abuse took place by proving when and where it occurred. Therefore, the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal on ex post facto grounds. The State's evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant duplicated or printed a photograph, videotape, or other visual record of sexually explicit conduct involving a child. The record showed that defendant was in possession of a computer that permitted the downloading and copying of images from the Internet or other sources. A rational trier of fact could infer that defendant himself printed or duplicated the images found in his possession. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress on timeliness grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to DUII. Because it was his third DUII conviction, the trial court permanently revoked his driving privileges pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.235(1)(b) (2003). On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 809.235(1)(b). The state argued that, because defendant pled guilty, the matter was not appealable. The court concluded that the matter was appealable. The court did not accept the premise of the State's argument that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050 limited a defendant to a challenge of a sentence. The State offered no argument in support of the suggestion that a revocation of driving privileges was not a &quot;disposition&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 138.050(1). However, the court's opinion in Terry was controlling and adverse to defendant's arguments regarding the constitutionality of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.235(1)(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an inmate, was moved to administration segregation after another prisoner was murdered. While he was away, the cell was searched and a hypodermic syringe was discovered. He was questioned about the syringe and gave an incriminating statement. After defendant was convicted, he sought review. In reversing, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.275 was unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;sharp instrument&quot; passed constitutional muster because the individual terms were commonly used and relatively precise. Also, when the prosecution proved that defendant possessed a hypodermic needle, it proved that he possessed a weapon defined in &sect; 166.275. However, the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to suppress his statements because they were obtained in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. Here, defendant was being interrogated without the Miranda warnings. The particular circumstances of questioning here created an environment in which defendant felt compelled to answer. Defendant was not told where he was going, he was handcuffed and guarded during questioning, and he was never told that he could return to his cell.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's decision to declare the road an RS 2477 road was a quasi-judicial decision, reviewable pursuant to Or.

Moreover, the determination that the road satisfied the criteria was a closely circumscribed factual situation. The landowner was jurisdictionally precluded from seeking declaratory and injunctive relief because the writ of review statutes were the exclusive remedy for such claims, and he had failed to timely pursue a remedy via those statutes. Thus, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the declaratory and injunctive relief claims. However, the inverse condemnation claim was for damages, and as such, it fell within the general jurisdiction of the trial court; Or. Rev.

The statute distinguished on the basis of where the person committed the offense, not on the basis of where the person who committed the offense resided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter arose out of defendant's sexual relationship with one of his students. The student admitted the sexual conduct, but the student refused to testify at trial. Defendant assigned error to the trial court's admission of other evidence of the sexual nature of their relationship. The trial court reasoned that because the child was unavailable, that bought into play Or. Evid. Code 804, rather than Or. Evid. Code 803(18a). The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred by admitting a videotape and a grand jury clerk's testimony over defendant's hearsay objections, but that there was little likelihood that the errors affected the jury's verdict. As to sentencing, the jury found that each offense constituted a separate criminal episode. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err by reconstituting defendant's criminal history score when imposing sentence on the second and third counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The allegedly injured party, whose claims against the corporations had previously been dismissed as time barred, refiled her claims under a special &quot;revival&quot; statute enacted by the legislature in 2003. The trial court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional and dismissed the claims against defendants with prejudice. The injured party brought a complaint for injuries that allegedly arose out of a laparoscopic surgery. The injured party then amended her complaint to include the corporations. On appeal, the injured party asserted that the trial court erred in holding the revival statute unconstitutional. The corporations could have raised the alleged failure to abide by the statute as an affirmative defense, but they were required to set forth the defense in their answer or motion to dismiss. The appellate court declined to find an alternative statutory basis for affirming the trial court. Further, the appellate court concluded that the revival statute was not a violation of due process. Finally, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the ground that the revival statute, 2003 Oregon Laws ch. 768, &sect; 2, was a violation of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) issued a final order concluding that petitioners, a restaurant, its president, and its secretary, violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 471.360(1)(b) by mixing, serving, or selling alcoholic beverages without a license and violated Or. Admin. R. 845-006-0345(11)(c) by conducting drinking contests. Petitioners sought judicial review of the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant held stage shows on weekend nights in which the president drizzled a Greek liqueur into the open mouths of patrons while the crowd counted. The patron who continued drinking for the longest count won a T-shirt. In determining that petitioners violated Or. Admin. R. 845-006-0345(11)(c), OLCC in effect interpreted the rule to mean that conduct involving &quot;competition&quot; and &quot;free pouring&quot; constituted a drinking contest designed to increase consumption of alcohol in increased quantities, regardless of the licensees' intent in conducting such a contest or any measurement of the amounts consumed during the contest relative to amounts otherwise consumed. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.482(8)(a) and (c), the court determined that remand was necessary because OLCC's interpretation of the rule was inconsistent with the wording of the rule, particularly the plainly stated limitation as to which drinking contests were subject to the rule and the plain meanings of the words &quot;increase&quot; and &quot;design.&quot; Nothing in OLCC's interpretation or application of the rule identified the consumption or quantities against which the required &quot;increase&quot; was to be, or was, measured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed as to the drinking contest violation and remanded for reconsideration. The court otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his burglary and theft convictions were upheld on direct appeal, petitioner filed a petition for postconviction relief asserting various errors.

The Malheur County Circuit Court (Oregon) granted the official's motion to strike the petition pursuant to Or. R. Civ. P. 23(A) and (D). Petitioner challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court did not err in granting the motion to strike the amended petition in its entirety as petitioner had not sought permission to file the amended petition. Accordingly, the issue of whether the lower court would have been required to permit the filing of the amended petition at that time was not before the appellate court. In addition, petitioner had not assigned error to the denial of his subsequent written an oral requests to file an amended petition and as a result, that issue was not before the appellate court. Petitioner also offered no cogent reason why the lower court erred in striking the amended petition. The lower court did not err in striking the paragraph concerning the prosecution's attack of its own witness as Or. Evid. Code 607 permitted any party to attack a witness's credibility. The paragraph asserting several defects did not allege that counsel was ineffective and thus, they did not support an inadequate counsel claim. Those defects also could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal and petitioner failed to show any prejudice from the dismissal of that paragraph. The remaining assignments of error also lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a)(B) on its face violated the free expression guarantee in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. After the Washington County Circuit Court (Oregon) disallowed the demurrer, defendant was convicted of directing racist, obscene, and homophobic insults at the occupants of a car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prior version of the statute was held unconstitutional because it focused on expression instead of harm. The current statute shifted the focus from expression to conduct: No crime occurred unless harm, i.e., harassment or annoyance likely to provoke a violent response, occurred, albeit harm that was caused by expression. That type of harm was within the legislature's authority to prevent. The statute was not overly broad. To convict for the only type of speech intended and likely to cause a violent response that might have been privileged, inflammatory insults with political implications, the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the epithet was intended and likely to provoke retaliatory violence from a specified individual. The finding that defendant's speech was intended and likely to provoke a violent response was affirmed where the evidence showed that he had used racial and other epithets over an amplified public address system, in stop-and-go traffic, for upward of five minutes. Moreover, a brief heated oral exchange had taken place. No physical violence had occurred, but only because the victim's companion had intervened.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutory and administrative standards for cancelling driving privileges were not unconstitutionally vague under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21, as they reasonably cabined the DMV's discretion.

Admin. R. 735-062-0073(3). The individual had preserved the issue of whether the DMV erred in denying further testing where her attorney had expressly raised the issue at the hearing and the DMV had addressed the issue. However, the DMV did not err in denying the individual's ability to take a fourth driving test as its final order, when read in its entirety, showed that it had applied the correct standard, i.e., Or. Admin. R. 735-063-0073. Moreover, substantial evidence supported the DMV's finding that the standard was met. The DMV's refusal to issue a permit so that the individual could take driving lessons was reversed as it failed to explain why further driver training or driver rehabilitation should not have been made available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before his death, plaintiff decedent sued defendant agency and director, seeking a petition for a writ of review and alleging constitutional, conversion, and contract claims related to alleged sewer overpayments. The Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) dismissed the petition pursuant to Or. R. Civ. P. 21A and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims. Appellant personal representatives challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representatives were entitled to challenge the basis for the trial court's decision without having to show that the decedent preserved the same arguments below or that the trial court's error was plain on the face of the record where the trial court had invoked a new principle in deciding defendants' motions to dismiss, i.e., the decedent had not served a writ. Since the decedent did not have notice that service would be an issue, he had no opportunity to preserve any error. Thus, the parties were entitled to dispute the issue on appeal. The trial court erred in dismissing the petition for a writ of review for lack of jurisdiction where the decedent had filed it within the statutorily prescribed time, thereby giving the trial court jurisdiction. The decedent's failure to file the requisite undertaking was not a jurisdictional defect. Summary judgment was improper on the remaining claims where the condemnation and common law claims sought to enforce rights that would not necessarily be adjudicated on review of the agency's decision. Thus, it was premature to determine whether the remaining claims would be precluded by the adjudication of the writ of review claim.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by disallowing defendant's demurrer to one of the indictments charging him with first-degree official misconduct and coercion on the ground that some of the counts lacked enough specificity to allow him to prepare a defense because the charges tracked the wording of the statutes defining official misconduct and coercion, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 162.415, 163.275. The fact that the charged crimes were complex, making the indictment difficult to defend against, did not make the indictment, worded using the statutory alternatives, fatally insufficient. The fact that the discovery was voluminous did not establish that it was insufficient to illuminate the indictment; the kind of discovery reasonably expected would include witness statements regarding what defendant did or failed to do, which would supply the requisite specificity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, before the Coos County Circuit Court, Oregon, of rape in the first degree, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.375. Defendant appealed, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress DNA evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rape was committed in 1998. In 2001, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.076, defendant was required to provide a buccal sample following his convictions for felonies. In 2002, the Oregon State Police crime laboratory compared the DNA that had been seized from the rape scene with the sample given by defendant in 2001 and determined that the samples matched. That discovery led to the issuance of a search warrant and the seizure of additional DNA from defendant. That evidence was admitted at trial. Defendant argued that the compelled taking of his DNA in 2001 pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.076 violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, the procedure that occurred in this case was akin to the fingerprinting of a person in custody; therefore, the appellate court concluded that the seizure of defendant's DNA did not constitute an unreasonable seizure under either constitution. Defendant also filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he challenged the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;137.700. Nevertheless, defendant conceded that he did not raise an objection in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The methodology at issue was intended to operate as the framework to fund improvements to wastewater treatment facilities. The appellate court had to determine whether the developers' challenges were properly reviewed by the trial court for substantial evidence or whether the trial court should have considered the issues raised by the developers as legal issues concerning statutory construction. The appellate court held that the issues, as framed by the developers, did not present issues of statutory interpretation because they did not raise questions of legislative intent regarding the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 223.304(1), (2). Rather, the statutes informed what a methodology for the assessment of improvement fees had to be based on. Although the developers disagreed with some of the factors relied on by the cities that formed the basis for the methodology, those kinds of determinations were used by experts in the field to formulate methodologies for assessing SDCs. Because those factors were factual in nature, they were properly subject to review for substantial evidence, and the trial court did not err in exercising its review authority under Or. Rev.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the trial court erred in granting the superintendent's motion to dismiss the writ on the ground that the inmate's access to the courts claim failed to state a claim for relief.

The inmate also alleged that he was unable to adequately and meaningfully defend against the attorney general's pleadings which cited certain cases. Although the inmate did not identify the specific pleadings at issue, he did allege that the impediment affected his ability to respond to pleadings, not some other legal instrument. This was sufficient to allege that the inmate was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to present his claims to the court as required by the Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), convicted defendant of three counts of first degree arson, two counts of attempted first degree arson, two counts of unlawful possession and two counts of unlawful manufacture of a destructive device, one count of first degree criminal mischief, and one count of attempted first degree criminal mischief, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;164.325 (1999), 161.405, 166.382, 166.384, 164.365, and 161.405. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of defendant's arson and attempted arson offenses violated only one statutory provision, namely Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.325(1)(b). That aspect of the appellate court's analysis weighed in favor of merger under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.067(1). Further, the circumstance at issue in each offense did not require proof of an element that the other circumstances did not. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.067(1) did not preclude merger of defendant's three convictions for first-degree arson arising out of his conduct in setting the car dealership fire. By the same reasoning, that statute also did not preclude merger of defendant's two convictions for attempted arson arising out of the incident at the petroleum product supplier's truck yard. Also, for purposes of the two attempted arson convictions, the victim for each count was the same - the petroleum product supplier, who was the owner of the fuel truck that was the direct object of defendant's conduct. Thus, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.067(1) and (2), the trial court erred in failing to merge defendant's three arson convictions into a single conviction and in failing to merge his two attempted arson convictions into a single conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for entry of a judgment reflecting a single conviction for first-degree arson and a single conviction for attempted first-degree arson. The appellate court vacated defendant's sentences and remanded the case for resentencing. Otherwise, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.110(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to recognize signs of fetal distress during plaintiff's labor in March 1994 and negligently delayed performing a cesarean section delivery. Within six to eight months after the delivery, plaintiff suspected negligence but she contended that she did not learn of the child's permanent injuries until May 1999. The negligence action was filed in January 2003. The court agreed with the trial court that the statute of limitations under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.160 did not begin to run based on plaintiff's mere suspicion of tortious conduct within six to eight months. Nevertheless, the court also agreed with the trial court that, notwithstanding &sect; 12.160, the statute of ultimate repose under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.110(4) barred plaintiff's claim because it was not brought within five years of March 1994. Because plaintiff would not have had an absolute common-law right to bring an action in negligence for the child's prenatal injuries in 1857 when the Oregon Constitution was adopted, the trial court properly ruled that the application of &sect; 12.110(4) to plaintiff's claims did not violate the remedy clause of Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's charges arose from a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct directed against two victims. Defendant argued the court's imposition of consecutive sentences pursuant to &sect; 137.123(5) violated his right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI through the Blakely and Apprendi rules. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Blakely and Apprendi concerned what facts were required to be found by a jury in order to impose a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum for a single offense and involved a court's usurpation of factfinding traditionally performed by juries. Apprendi and Blakely did not address multiple sentences running consecutively, and the determination to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences was not a traditional jury function. Thus, although Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123(5) did require the court to make findings of fact, it did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's original decision to reverse the department's orders with respect to three of the signs was based on the failure of the department to provide adequate notice to petitioner.

The court's original decision, however, also affirmed the department's final orders with respect to the remaining three signs, and that part of the court's decision had to be reversed. With respect to each of those signs, the department predicated its determination that the signs were unlawful on its conclusions that (1) each of the signs was an &quot;outdoor advertising sign&quot; within the meaning of the OMIA because it advertised goods and services that were located off the premises, and (2) petitioner had erected and maintained the signs without obtaining the permits required by the OMIA for such signs. Because the Oregon Supreme Court had struck down the permitting requirements for &quot;outdoor advertising signs&quot; that formed the basis for the department's conclusion that petitioner's signs were unlawful, the court concluded that the department erred in concluding that petitioner was required to obtain such permits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was brought by the personal representative on behalf of the estate of a machinist who was killed while operating a vertical industrial lathe at the manufacturer's facility. Defendants argued that the trial court erred in denying their motions for a directed verdict and for a new trial on the award of economic damages. Defendants also appealed the award of punitive damages. The jury also awarded $ 1.9 million in noneconomic damages, which the court reduced to $ 500,000 pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;31.710. The appellate court found that punitive damages were proper because the evidence permitted the jury to conclude, by clear and convincing evidence, that the manufacturer had shown a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm and had acted with a conscious indifference to the health, safety and welfare of others under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;31.730(1). Given the manufacturers earlier reluctance to implement safety measures, no reduction of the punitive damages award was warranted. The evidence of the machinist's projected wages with his employer supported an award of damages for lost earning capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that he was transferred to the Intensive Management Unit (IMU) at a correctional institution as additional punishment for a fight and assault on a corrections officer. The inmate's theory was that placement in the IMU constituted punishment--a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest--and that he was entitled to a hearing before being assigned to that unit. The trial court stated that there was no constitutional right to placement outside the IMU. On appeal, the court did not reach the merits of the inmate's constitutional argument because the court concluded that he was not entitled to raise his challenge in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court noted that cases in which courts concluded that habeas corpus was the only appropriate remedy generally involved ongoing concerns about health or safety. The inmate neither challenged the conditions of confinement in the IMU as violating his constitutional rights, nor did he assert that he was suffering from dangerous or unhealthy conditions. The court noted that his procedural challenges to his IMU assignment could have been brought as a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the Board correctly found that the date of injury was not an issue that was resolved by the stipulation. The claimant was entitled to challenge the processing of the claim if it failed to result in benefits provided by law. Thus, the claimant's challenge to the date of injury stated in the notice of closure was not precluded by the stipulation. The court also concluded that Oregon's Contracts Clause, Or. Const. art.

The court concluded that a lab report that was prepared by staff at a state crime laboratory at the request of police for use in a criminal prosecution of a specific defendant would not fall within the shop book rule exception to the hearsay rule. The court disagreed with the trial court that Or. Rev.

Regarding the PAC's status as a political committee, there was no &quot;application.&quot; Because there was no &quot;application,&quot; the PAC's submissions could not have been made in connection with an application for any benefit. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss the &sect; 162.085(1) count as to the PAC. The taxpayer organization's submissions of the false statements were properly not dismissed because they were material to its continuing eligibility and beneficial entitlement to engage in fund-raising activities in Oregon.

After determining that defendant's driving privileges were suspended and that she did not have automobile insurance, the officer cited defendant and impounded her vehicle. The officer conducted an inventory search of the vehicle's contents pursuant to the police department's policy, which required that all impounded vehicles be inventoried. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence of contraband seized from her car pursuant to the department's inventory policy. The instant court concluded that the inventory violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The power to inventory a vehicle's contents could only be conducted pursuant to a properly authorized policy. Because the department's inventory policy required the officer to open all closed containers in the impounded vehicle, it was not reasonably related to protecting property or eliminating false claims. Thus, the purported inventory that was conducted pursuant to the policy was a warrantless and nonconsensual search requiring suppression of the evidence found during the inventory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Multnomah County, Oregon, convicted defendant for unlawful prostitution activities, Portland, Or., City Code (PCC) 14A.40.050. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that PCC 14A.40.050 was unconstitutional because it was preempted by state statute and was impermissibly vague. The appellate court found that the challenged ordinance did not prohibit what the state statutes,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.405 and 167.007(1), permitted. The State was correct that the ordinance and the statutes prohibited the same conduct. Even if defendant were correct, the fact that a state statute did not expressly prohibit conduct did not establish that the state statute affirmatively permitted that conduct. The legislature did not intend affirmatively to permit actions that were prohibited by PCC 14A.40.050. The ordinance quite unambiguously prohibited the behavior engaged in by defendant, and, as a result, defendant was precluded from bringing a facial vagueness challenge. Each of the terms at issue was clearly tied to conduct committed in a manner manifesting a particular intent, in this case, an intent to induce, entice, solicit, procure, locate, or contact another person to commit an act of prostitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.650(6). The matter commenced when respondent union filed a petition for clarification of the public employee status of the county employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that the county did not exhaust its administrative remedies and that the court was precluded from considering the county's arguments. The court disagreed, but it noted that merely because the county exhausted its administrative remedies did not mean that it could consider all of the arguments that the county raised on judicial review. The court first declined to consider the county's argument that, by adding the word &quot;necessary,&quot; ERB made &sect; 243.650(6) impossibly and unconstitutionally vague. The constitutionality of &sect; 243.650(6) was not raised below and the county therefore did not preserve its argument. The court also declined to consider the county's argument that ERB improperly added the word &quot;necessary&quot; to the definition of confidential employee in &sect; 243.650(6) and that the addition of &quot;necessary&quot; to &sect; 243.650(6) violated principles of statutory interpretation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, former police chief of appellee city, challenged the decision of the Circuit Court, Columbia County (Oregon), which granted the city's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action against appellee city councilor in the chief's action that arose out of the termination of her employment, including complaints under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 659.510(2), 659.530 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The councilor was a practicing criminal defense attorney, and the chief asserted that the councilor attempted to use his position to benefit his law practice. The chief's employment was terminated after some outbursts, including the throwing of furniture. The chief settled only her intentional interference claim against the councilor. The court reversed in part and held that the claims disposition agreement executed between the chief and the workers' compensation carrier did not operate as a release of all claims because many of the chief's claims did not arise out of the workers' compensation claim itself. Also, because the city did not raise the affirmative defense of insufficient service of process, it waived that defense. Further, a reasonable factfinder could find that the decision had been made to terminate the chief by the time of the chair-throwing incident, and there was conflicting evidence about the city council's involvement in the termination decision. Therefore, there were triable issues on the &sect; 1983 claim. The Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659.510 claim was barred by the statute of limitations, but the wrongful discharge claim was an exception to the at-will employment rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision by the Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, which refused to order defendant, who had been convicted of two counts of first degree robbery with a firearm, to serve a 30-year gun minimum sentence pursuant to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610(4)(c) (2001) (amended 2005). Instead, the trial court imposed a 10-year gun minimum sentence. Defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1982, defendant was convicted by a jury of first degree robbery. In 1983, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing without a jury and found that defendant had used or threatened to use a firearm in the commission of the robbery. Defendant did not appeal or seek postconviction relief regarding his conviction or the gun minimum sentence imposed for that conviction. The instant court concluded that the legislature did not intend to allow a challenge to predicate convictions in subsequent sentence enhancement proceedings under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610 (2001). The legislature intended defendants to have previously obtained relief on direct appeal or through postconviction relief from any prior unconstitutional sentences. Defendant's failure to resort to either of those remedies left his 1983 conviction and sentence in existence in the record as a legally cognizable judgment of a conviction and sentence for a felony having as an element the use or threatened use of a firearm. Consequently, the 1983 conviction and sentence, combined with a 1991 robbery conviction and sentence, subjected defendant to enhanced punishment under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610(4)(c).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed as to the conviction and found that Or. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner was 17 years old, he learned that he had lymphoblastic leukemia. Petitioner sought to establish a common-law mature minor exception to the statute allowing a juvenile court judge to authorize emergency medical care. The instant court declined to decide the issue raised by petitioner because petitioner had turned 18 years old, rendering the juvenile court's order moot. Although petitioner argued the juvenile court continued to have jurisdiction pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.328, that statute did not apply to petitioner. The juvenile court derived its statutory authority to order medical care from Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.110. Although the juvenile court may have lawfully issued an order that applied to petitioner, it did not do so pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.100. That being the case, petitioner was never found to be within the juvenile court's jurisdiction as provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.100. Thus, Or. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(1), and limited the hospital's liability to the maximum award under the limits of the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.260 to 30.300.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's guardian filed a medical malpractice suit after the patient was deprived of oxygen while recuperating from successful surgery for a congenital heart defect. The hospital admitted its negligence, and the trial court resolved the case on the pleadings by limiting the judgment to the maximum amount under the OTCA and disposing of the claims against the individual defendants. On appeal, the patient claimed that the trial court deprived him of his rights to a remedy and to a jury trial under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10 and 7. The court rejected the patient's claim that the OTCA damages cap deprived him of a remedy because although the hospital had been separated from the state education system, the hospital remained an instrumentality of the state and thus would have been immune from liability. Thus the OTCA did not deprive the patient of a remedy or his jury trial right. However, the court held that the patient would have had a common law remedy against the individual defendants and the application of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(1) of the OTCA limiting the patient's remedy to the hospital, was not an adequate substitute remedy, and thus violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court judgment that disposed of the patient's claims against the individual defendants and affirmed the portion of the judgment that limited the hospital's liability to the damages cap in the OTCA. The court remanded the case with instructions to reinstate the judgment against the hospital in the amount of $ 200,000 and to reinstate the patient's claims against the individual defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the father transferred property to the owner, his son, reserving a life estate. In 1997, the father applied for medical assistance from the State. After his death, the State filed a complaint against the owner to recover the amount paid under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 414.105 and Or. Admin. R. 461-135-0845. The State argued that an amendment to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 414.105 abrogated the common law rule that a life estate was extinguished at the moment of death for purposes of recovering medical assistance payments. The trial court granted summary judgment to the owner, and the State sought review. In reversing, the appellate court agreed that the life estate continued to exist under &sect; 414.105, as amended. Moreover, this applied regardless of when the life estate was created. The appellate court also found that Or. Admin. R. 461-135-0845 also applied retroactively based upon its express language. Finally, the appellate court declined to address the owner's as applied constitutional challenges because they had not been considered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company appealed the summary judgment by the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) in favor of defendant Oregon Insurance Guaranty Association (OIGA) in the company's action seeking a declaration that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 734.695, 734.510, on which OIGA relied to deny the company's subrogation claim against an insolvent insurer violated the remedy guarantee of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was the workers' compensation insurance carrier for a county. When an injured employee whom the company had paid benefits to filed a third party claim against parties insured by the insolvent insurer, OIGA stepped in to defend against the third-party claim and the company sought to assert its statutory lien under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 656.580, 656.593 against OIGA. The court did not agree with OIGA's argument that the case was not ripe on the basis that the company might have a remedy in an insolvency proceeding because the existence of another remedy was irrelevant to the constitutionality of the legislation. Also, the company's failure to preserve the constitutional issue was not an impediment per se because OIGA relied on estoppel as an alternative ground for affirmance without further discussion. However, the court affirmed, and held that upon examination of the remedy clause in context, it determined that the clause applied to natural persons only, but not to artificial entities. Because there was no dispute that the company was not a natural person, it followed that it was not subject of the guarantee of the remedy clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the PUC exceeded its authority when it enacted the rules. Alternatively, it argued that the legislature made an unconstitutional delegation to the PUC under Ore. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, art. III, &sect; 1, and art. IV, &sect;1 and that the PUC's rules violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellate court found that the promulgation of the penalty rules fell within the reach of the legislature's grant of authority to the PUC and it deferred to the PUC's actions so long as they were consistent with the legislature's purpose to promote the establishment and maintenance of safe and efficient utility poles and other applicable laws. Because the sanctions that may be imposed under the rules were designed to deter unauthorized and unsafe attachments on utility poles, the PUC did not exceed its authority by adopting the challenged rules. The rules satisfied the test that the danger of discriminatory action not be outweighed by the practical necessities of the efficient administration of legislative policy. The rules comported with the Oregon Constitution and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 294.100 for declaratory relief, damages, and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from expending public funds for the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the advice of the county attorney, defendants directed the marriage license division to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

The trial court in that case enjoined the county from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples until the legislature had an opportunity to enact remedial legislation. The court affirmed, and held that under recent decisions, public officials could avoid liability if they relied on the advice of counsel. Further, statements contained in affidavits submitted by the taxpayer under Or. R. Civ. P. 47E did not create a triable issue because they were not offered to establish facts, rather they were offered as expert legal opinions about the underlying issues of whether the county could issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Also, because it was concluded in the case filed by the same-sex couples that the county lacked authority to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples, the claim for injunctive relief was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2002, defendant's angling privileges were revoked under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 497.415(6).

He was charged with angling without a license under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 479.441. Defendant's motion for an acquittal was denied, and he was convicted. In reversing, the appellate court engaged in a statutory construction analysis. At the first level of the analysis, the appellate court determined that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 497.079 was unambiguous. The exemption from licensing requirements embodied in that statute was unqualified. Section 497.079 applied to all Oregonians, including those whose angling licenses had been revoked. Defendant, in fishing on &quot;free fishing weekend,&quot; was engaging in an angling activity that was exempted from licensing requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHS petitioned the circuit court to appoint a guardian for the child, who was a severely disabled three-and-a-half-year-old ward of the court in the custody of the DHS.

Stat. &sect; 125.305(1)(b), stating that there was clear evidence that the appointment was necessary as a means of providing continuing care and supervision of the child. That was based on the mother's non-relationship with the child. She was a stranger to the child and had never asked the DHS caseworker for medical information regarding her child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV), appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon) that ordered the DMV to reinstate respondent petitioner's driving privileges after his conviction in Arizona for driving while under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), on which the DMV based the suspension under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.400, had been set aside following petitioner's completion of a treatment program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's driving privileges were suspended pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.400(1) based on a DUII conviction in Arizona. The DMV refused to reinstate petitioner's privileges after his Arizona conviction was set aside. The circuit court ordered the DMV to reinstate petitioner's privileges, on the belief that had petitioner committed the DUII in Oregon, he would have been eligible for diversion and avoided conviction and suspension.  On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred because petitioner had been convicted in Arizona, even though it was later set aside; thus the mandatory suspension provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.400(1) applied, rather than the discretionary provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 809.400(1). The court noted that the Driver License Compact, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 802.540, required that out-of-state conduct be treated the same as in-state conduct, and that the test for similar treatment was whether the DUII statutes were similar. The court held that the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(A)(1) and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010(1)(b), were substantially similar; thus the DMV complied with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.400(1) when it suspended petitioner's privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court judgment and remanded the case with instructions to reinstate the DMV order suspending petitioner's driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.305(6). The instant court concluded that a reasonable jury could find beyond a doubt that, when defendant put his mouth on the victim's neck, he knew or should have known that she considered it, under the circumstances, to be an &quot;intimate&quot; part. Immediately before defendant touched the victim's neck, she had told him that she was not interested in dating him, and she had pushed him away when he forcibly embraced her. A reasonable person in defendant's position should have known that the victim would have regarded his touching her neck to be touching an intimate part. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. The instant court could not say that sentencing defendant to life in prison shocked the moral sense of all reasonable people. Defendant had been convicted of nine prior sex offenses, some of which involved the use of force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendant county and others on discrimination and retaliation claims. The county's motion for directed verdict was denied and it was found liable. The Circuit Court of Lane County, Oregon, denied the employee's request to resubmit the case and awarded her no compensatory damages, but did award her punitive damages. The county's motion for judgment not withstanding the verdict (JNOV) was granted. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the employee contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in granting the county's motion for JNOV. The appellate court found that the trial court granted the JNOV motion on two grounds (public entity immunity and the necessity of predicate compensatory damages) that the county had not previously asserted in a motion for a directed verdict. The county could have raised its &quot;immunity&quot; ground at the time that it moved for a directed verdict, but failed to do so. Further, although the county could not have raised the irreconcilability of the jury's compensatory and punitive damage determinations before the case was submitted to the jury, the county could not, consistently with Or. R. Civ. P. 63(A), obtain a JNOV on that ground. Rather, the county was limited to seeking to resubmit the matter to the jury with proper instructions pursuant to Or. R. Civ. P. 59(G)(4), or, if that request were denied, to seeking a new trial. The county's failure to move for a new trial in the alternative to its motion for JNOV effected a waiver of the new trial remedy. As such, the trial court erred in granting the county's motion for JNOV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment notwithstanding the verdict was reversed, and the case was remanded for the trial court to address the merits of the county's motion to reduce the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to first degree kidnapping and second degree assault, the Circuit Court of Marion County, Oregon, sentenced him to 90 months' incarceration for the kidnapping and, consecutive to that sentence, 70 months' incarceration for the assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences based on facts that were not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him, in violation of Apprendi and Blakely. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that defendant pleaded guilty to more than one criminal offense arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct; therefore, the sentences were presumptively concurrent under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123(4). However, the assault included the actual infliction of physical injury, whereas the kidnapping offense included only moving the victim from one place to another for the purpose of causing physical injury, and defendant's guilty plea and his colloquy with the trial court amounted to admissions of that fact. As such, concurrent sentences were appropriate under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123(5)(b) and, under a straightforward application of the Blakely rule, the trial court's sentence was not unconstitutional. Even if Blakely and Apprendi applied to the imposition of consecutive sentences, the trial court did not violate defendant's right to a jury trial as the admitted facts could be used in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

He received a 60-month sentence for the rape conviction and a 14-month sentence for the attempted sexual abuse conviction. Defendant stipulated, and the trial court ordered at the sentencing proceeding, that the sentences were to be served consecutively. However, the written judgments did not so specify. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.083, the trial court later entered an amended judgment in the first case to correct the error and make the 14-month sentence in that case consecutive to the 60-month sentence in the second case. Defendant appealed from the amended judgment, but the court affirmed, stating that &sect; 138.083 permitted courts to correct any erroneous term in the judgment. Additionally, the common law rule set forth in the case had no application. The legislature had the ability to modify such common law rules and it clearly did so by enacting &sect; 138.083, which specifically allowed for the type of sentence modification at issue in the case, notwithstanding that the sentence had been executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the former employees sued under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659.035, part of the general unlawful employment practices law, for violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659.510, the public employee whistleblower law. The county argued that the trial court should have granted its motion to dismiss the second employee's whistleblower claim because she brought her claim under &sect; 659.510, which had a 90-day limitations period. The second employee argued that her whistleblower claim was brought under the general unlawful employment practices statute and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659.121's one-year limitation applied. The instant court concluded that the one-year limitation period of &sect; 659.121 governed. It also concluded that plaintiffs' wrongful termination claims were not legally barred due to the existence of an alternative statutory cause of action, namely the workers' compensation system. Although the county argued that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies, plaintiffs were not using the judicial system to challenge the outcome of an administrative process. Therefore, no exhaustion issue existed. The trial court properly denied the county's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners argued the triple majority statutory scheme was unconstitutional under both the Oregon and United States constitutions because it dispensed, in certain circumstances, with a vote of the electorate on a proposed municipal annexation. At issue was whether Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.111(5) required the legislative body of a city to submit a proposal for annexation to the electors of the territory proposed for annexation and then, in conjunction with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.170(1), whether it selectively withdrew that right from some electors. The appellate court concluded that petitioners were not members of a suspected class. Because the triple majority annexation method provided in &sect; 222.170(1) did not create a generalized right to vote on municipal annexation decisions, because no such right existed under the Constitution, and because the statutory scheme satisfied the rational basis standard, it did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought judicial review of two final orders of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) that were consolidated on review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was assessed a fuel tax by ODOT pursuant to IFTA, which was a multi-jurisdictional agreement that was intended to encourage cooperation in the administration and collection of motor fuel use tax. Petitioner asserted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 825.555 was an invalid delegation of power by the legislature because it did not adopt the specific international fuel tax agreement that ODOT entered into and because the statute adopted future tax agreements. ODOT did not err in rejecting petitioner's arguments. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 825.555 was not an improper delegation of power by the legislature. In addition, petitioner failed to prove that ODOT did not follow the proper procedures in adopting IFTA. IFTA's provisions were not rules, but were simply part of an agreement; moreover, ODOT promulgated Or. Admin. R. 740-200-040, which adopted IFTA. IFTA did not exempt idle time from taxation, and with respect to the idle time issue, the same interpretation of the language of IFTA applied. Finally, petitioner waived its arguments regarding the validity of IFTA through stipulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court, Malheur County, Oregon, to driving while under the influence of intoxicants, assault in the second degree, and assault in the third degree. The trial court imposed a departure sentence of 36 months in prison with 24 months' supervision. Defendant then filed a petition for post-conviction relief; however, the trial court rejected all of his claims and dismissed the petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the departure sentence on the third-degree assault conviction was unconstitutional, the trial court should have modified it. The State responded that, because defendant did not assert that claim in his petition for post-conviction relief, it was waived. Defendant also contended that his criminal trial counsel's failure to object to the departure sentence on Apprendi and Blakely grounds amounted to constitutionally inadequate assistance. The appellate court noted that a claim not asserted in the post-conviction petition was deemed waived and that the principles announced in Apprendi and Blakely did not apply retroactively in collateral, post-conviction proceedings. The appellate court held that at the time defendant was sentenced, the law stated that a departure from a presumptive sentence did not run afoul of Apprendi as long as the upward departure was authorized under the sentencing guidelines and did not exceed the statutory maximum. The appellate court concluded that had defendant's counsel objected to defendant's sentence, the objection would have failed, even though that principle of law was later called into question by Blakely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners all had property located within the boundaries of the irrigation district. The trial court determined that the action was not justiciable because the owners had not shown that the district's denial of their request for exclusion from the district, even if erroneous, had a practical effect on the owners' rights. On appeal, the owners renewed their argument that &sect; 545.099 accorded them an absolute right to have their land removed from the district. The court determined that the statutory right that the owners asserted was one whose denial, by itself, constituted a cognizable injury or practical effect. The court noted that it had never held that a landowner lacked constitutional standing to contest on judicial review a land use decision affecting the landowner's property. Because a judgment on the merits would have a practical effect on the legal status of the owners' property, their claim was constitutionally justiciable. Likewise, because the owners asserted an injury to a statutory right affecting their property, they had standing under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.040(1). It followed that the trial court erred in granting the district's cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff home buyers appealed a decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) on remand, which ruled against the homeowners in their declaratory action challenging the enforceability of several provisions in a land sale contract by which they purchased a house from defendant sellers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the buyers exercised their option to buy after renting for three years, the contract they signed stated that the property could not be sold without the consent of defendant seller and that the buyers would not pay more than $2,000 on the unpaid balance per year. The court held that it had jurisdiction because Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 was valid. The governor in 1910 had sufficient claim to the office at the time, and Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d) did not provide that provisions be repealed rather than amended if the full text was not contained. Also, the adoption of Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2b validated &sect; 1. The court held that the buyers did not to use unconscionability to obtain affirmative relief because they would be asserting only the rights the contract gave them. The consent provision was clearly unconscionable in that there was no evidence of a commercial need for the restriction; the only effect was to make it difficult for the buyers to sell the house and to give the seller an opportunity to seek a windfall. The limitation on pre-payment was unconscionable because essentially the buyers were unable to sell the house, and it placed the buyers at the seller's mercy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of two charges of felon in possession of a firearm, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270 (2003), based on his stipulation that he knowingly possessed two assault firearms at a time when he stood convicted of a prior sexual assault felony. After the sexual assault conviction was reversed, petitioner sought relief from the felon in possession conviction. The Circuit Court, Malheur County (Oregon) granted relief, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A federal court reversed the underlying sexual assault felony after determining that it was obtained in violation of petitioner's constitutional discovery rights. Petitioner then filed the post-conviction proceeding. On appeal, the court concluded that the prohibition against firearm possession in &sect; 166.270(1) focused on a person's status as a convicted felon when he or she possessed a firearm, not on the subsequent validity of that status. The Oregon felon-in-possession statute, like the federal law, reflected the desirability of a clear, bright line in respect to gun possession. The change to the person's felon status operated only prospectively, so that after the expungement, pardon, or restoration of civil rights that felony conviction no longer served to impose a firearm disability. Consequently, because petitioner did not obtain federal habeas relief from his sexual assault conviction before he engaged in the conduct that resulted in his two convictions for felon in possession, he was not constitutionally entitled to relief from those convictions. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it granted him post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that &sect; 222.750&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived residents and property owners in &quot;island&quot; territories of the fundamental right to vote on annexations. However, the court concluded there was no fundamental right to vote on municipal annexations. It noted that &sect; 222.750 involved a determination of whether, in a particular circumstance, an election would be held; it did not unlawfully impose qualifications on who could participate, once the legislature decided to hold an election. The legislature simply exercised its authority to determine that, in a particular geographic area--namely, where territory was surrounded by the boundaries of a city, or by the boundaries of a city and a stream, bay, lake or other body of water--annexation of that territory could proceed without an election. Everyone who fell within the scope of &sect; 222.750 was treated identically. There was a rational basis for treating &quot;island&quot; territories differently than non-&quot;island&quot; territories. Because there was a rational basis for the differential treatment provided in the statute, the landowners failed to demonstrate that &sect; 222.750 violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

At the commitment hearing, two mental health professionals testified that appellant suffered from a mental disorder and, as a result, posed a danger to others. On appeal of the trial court's order committing appellant to the custody of the Mental Health Division, the court affirmed. The court held that the testimony of mental health experts, appellant's past violent act of firing her gun, and her condition at the time of the hearing constituted clear and convincing evidence that she was a danger to others at the time of the hearing. Two mental health experts testified that appellant still harbored the paranoid fears that led her to fire the gun. At the hearing, appellant stated that her conduct was justified because someone threw something at her door and later someone knocked on her door, and therefore she lacked insight into the danger of firing a gun at the wall of a neighboring apartment. Clear and convincing evidence also showed that appellant would not participate in treatment on a voluntary basis under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 426.130(1)(b)(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff worker appealed a decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, a public workers' compensation insurer and its president, in the worker's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action alleging that defendants deprived him of his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by terminating his permanent total disability (PTD) benefits without a pretermination hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was injured on the job an began receiving PTD benefits from the insurer in 1981. In 2001, the insurer reevaluated the worker and determined that he was only entitled to permanent partial disability payments. The decision was affirmed and the worker claimed that he was entitled to a hearing before terminative his PTD benefits. The court reversed in part and held that whether defendants were &quot;persons&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1983 turned on whether they would be entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The court held that defendants were not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and were thus &quot;persons&quot; subject to suit under &sect; 1983. However, although the insurer was not an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes, defendants acted under color of state law given that the insurer was a creature of the state legislature, it had no private stockholders and its directors were appointed by the governor. Further, the due process claim was not barred by claim preclusion because the worker could not have asserted his constitutional claims before the hearings division. However, for purposes of injunctive relief only the claim was moot.</SPAN></P>

The justice of the peace argued that the appellate court should not entertain the owner's jurisdictional argument because it was not preserved in the trial court. The appellate court disagreed, holding that subject matter jurisdiction could be raised at any time. Nonetheless, the justice did possess subject matter jurisdiction over the forfeiture action as the owner was charged with animal neglect under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.325; thus, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 156.705, the justice of the peace had jurisdiction over those charges. As the justice court was &quot;the court&quot; before which the criminal action was pending on the animal neglect charges, the justice of the peace was authorized under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.347(1) to order forfeiture of the animals. However, the justice of the peace conceded, and the appellate court accepted the concession, that it was error to award costs to the county, as a nonparty, to the writ of review proceeding.</SPAN></P>

She appealed, assigning error to the denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal. She asserted the ordinance was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that defendant was seated in a walkway area and that her presence required other pedestrians to walk around her and her friend to get past. When they refused to move, the officer arrested defendant for obstructing the sidewalk. The dispositive issue on appeal was whether the ordinance, Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 14A.50.030 (2003), was preempted by Oregon law regulating the same conduct. In that respect, as to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025, a similar state law governing the crime of disorderly conduct, the appellate court found it was clear the Oregon Legislature intended to preserve from criminal liability conduct that obstructed vehicular or pedestrian traffic in the absence of proof that the actor either intended to create public inconveniences, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly created a risk of doing so. The legislature consciously avoided creating a strict liability offense out of concern for constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression. The ordinance prohibited precisely what the legislature intended to permit per its enactment of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025. Consequently, the ordinance conflicted with state law and was preempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, respondent inmate had stipulated to a sentence with presumptive concurrent 65-month terms of incarceration if his probation were revoked. Later, the Circuit Court of Umatilla County, Oregon, revoked his probation. However, in his postconviction action, the trial court found his sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Stroup v. Hill, as in the instant case, the post-conviction petitioner had been sentenced in accordance with a stipulated plea agreement that resulted in imposition of a sentence exceeding the 60-month maximum for Class C felonies. The post-conviction court had dismissed that claim, and the instant court had affirmed, holding in part, that a petitioner could not obtain post-conviction relief on any ground that reasonably could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal unless the petitioner demonstrated that the failure to raise the issue fell within one of several narrowly drawn exceptions. Although Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(2)(d) precluded appellate review of the petitioner's sentence in Stroup, it did not follow therefrom that he was precluded from withdrawing his plea made pursuant to the agreement before sentencing in the trial court. As in Stroup, the inmate in the instant case did not allege any other circumstances to show why he reasonably could not have been expected to raise his objection before sentencing. Thus, in the instant case, the trial court's allowance of relief based on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.530(1)(c) was plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which convicted him of two counts of kidnapping in the first degree, one count of assault in the second degree, two counts of assault in the fourth degree, two counts of burglary in the first degree, one count of menacing, and one count of interfering with a peace officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant all related to his assault on his girlfriend. On appeal, defendant argued that the two convictions for kidnapping should merge, because they represented alternate ways of committing the single crime of kidnapping in the first degree. The court agreed. It noted that the first-degree kidnapping statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.235, was indistinguishable from the state's aggravated murder statute, and that second-degree kidnapping became first-degree kidnapping by &quot;any&quot; of the enumerated means in the statute. The multiple intent factors constituted only different theories under which second-degree kidnapping was subject to enhanced penalties. Thus, only one judgment of conviction for kidnapping was proper. The court next determined that the trial court erred in failing to merge the two convictions for assault in the fourth degree with the conviction for assault in the second degree. Finally, the court decided that a single conviction for burglary more accurately reflected defendant's unlawful entry into his girlfriend's apartment than two convictions. The court was unaware of any evidence that demonstrated that defendant's initial unlawful entry ever ended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgments of conviction for first-degree kidnapping, fourth-degree assault, second-degree assault, and first-degree burglary. It remanded for resentencing with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for first-degree kidnapping stating that defendant was convicted on both theories, for second-degree assault, and for first-degree burglary stating that he was convicted on both theories. Otherwise, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the decedent's personal representative (representative), and defendant insurer both sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Multnomah County (Oregon), which awarded the representative compensatory damages and punitive damages based on the insurer's handling of a wrongful death claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The current action involved an auto accident in 1987 in which the decedent died following a collision with a pickup truck driven by a drunk driver (driver). The driver was in a vehicle insured by the insurer. The jury awarded the representative $ 863,274 in compensatory damages and $ 20,718,576 in punitive damages, based on the insurer's conduct in handling the wrongful death claim against the driver and in failing to settle that claim within policy limits. Both parties appealed. The court concluded that the punitive damage award was unconstitutionally excessive and also concluded that the trial court erred in calculating and reducing the compensatory damage award. Further, given the plain meaning of the terms &quot;liability insurance&quot; and &quot;insured against liability&quot; and the pertinent statutory context, it was apparent that the legislature, in enacting Or. Evid. Code 411(1), did not intend that provision to encompass and compel the exclusion from evidence of insurance &quot;pooling agreements.&quot; Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the pooling agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and remanded with instructions to grant the insurer's motion for new trial, limited to punitive damages, unless the representative agreed to remittitur of punitive damages to three times the compensatory damages award within 28 days of entry of the appellate judgment. On the representative's appeal, the judgment was vacated and remanded with instructions to recalculate the compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), which granted summary judgment to defendants, an employer and some of its managers. The employee alleged violations of the Oregon Public Employee Whistleblower Law, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 659A.203 to 659A.236, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other things, the employee became irate and hit a table during a human resources (HR) investigation into whether he sent a derogatory email regarding a coworker. The court concluded that none of the statements in retaliation for which the employee claimed he was terminated were protected by state or federal law. The court first determined that the employee's complaints were not within the purview of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659A.203. Even if he was fired because of his complaints and not because of his dishonesty and threatening conduct, the termination was not a violation of the Whistleblower Law. The court concluded that the legislature intended the term &quot;mismanagement&quot; in &sect; 659A.203 to refer to serious agency misconduct having the effect of actually or potentially undermining the agency's ability to fulfill its public mission, and the court found that the employee's comments did not fall within this definition. The court last determined that they trial court did not err in granting the employer's motion for summary judgment on the employee's &sect; 1983 claim. The employee did not voice matters of public concern, and for that reason, he had no cognizable constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization established ladies' auxiliaries for women but did not allow women to join the governing committees. The trial court held the policy of the organization to exclude women from membership violated the Act. The court affirmed and held that due to the nonselective membership practices, the organization was de facto open to the public. Nothing in the legislative history of the Act implied that its framers intended to exempt such organizations. The court also held that because the complaint challenged on the gender-based admission, the case did not implicate the organization's religious freedom because it was not being compelled to admit atheists. The court could not conclude that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 conferred a right of association that applied to organizations such as the defendant organization. Nothing in the record indicated that discourse about matters of public concern or political importance occupied anything more than an insignificant amount of committee time or resources. The record did not support the conclusion that requiring the organization to evenhandedly consider women for membership would impair the organization's social and charitable efforts.</SPAN></P>

No one contested the sufficiency of the record to support the trial court's decision to delay the trial for that reason and the court found that the total delay was not unreasonable. Because there was no evidence that defendant requested to consult with counsel, for purposes of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, before taking a breath test, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's objection to the admissibility of breath test results, and because a witness's testimony pertained to the issue of whether defendant was under the influence of intoxicants, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions to strike and for a mistrial.

Appellant, the subject child's putative father, refused to submit to parentage testing. He sought a declaratory judgment that such testing violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Circuit Court of Benton County, Oregon, rejected his request, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father contended that the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test that was required under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 416.430(5)(a) was an infringement on his rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. Amend. IV and that he was entitled to a hearing on the matter of his parentage before being required to submit to the DNA testing. However, the appellate court held that same (whether a blood test or a mouth swab for DNA) was a reasonable search under either constitutional provision for three reasons. First, it was conducted for the purpose of determining the paternity of, and thereby the financial responsibility for, children in Oregon, a purpose other than the enforcement of laws by means of criminal sanctions. Second, it was conducted pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 416.430, the legislative embodiment of the policy enacted by the Oregon Legislature. Third, &sect; 416.430 eliminated the discretion of those entrusted with administering the test; every person who denied paternity and sought a hearing in the circuit court on that issue had to first provide the DCS with a DNA sample. Thus, &sect; 416.430 did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a majority of the voters approved the formation of an airport district, the county issued an formation order. Thereafter, the cities and the taxpayers filed an action challenging the formation. After a motion to dismiss due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction was granted, an appeal was filed. In affirming, the court determined that actions under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.510 were required to be brought by the appropriate district attorney under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.610, and not a city attorney. Next, because a writ of review was available as a remedy to the formation of airport districts under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.785, it was the exclusive remedy under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.020. The court looked to the three criteria set forth in case law in determining that the formation was a quasi-judicial act. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 198.800, 198.805 required notice and a public hearing prior to the formation of an airport district. Moreover, the county was compelled to reach a decision regarding the airport district, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.785(1).

Thus, a failure to comply on this property was considered significant. However, the hearings official made no finding regarding the zoning of the subject property. Even though the appellate court could trace through the record a legitimate path by which the hearings official could have reached his conclusion regarding the significance of the owners' violation, its task on judicial review was not to serve as a pathfinder.

She filed a negligence action against the city, which contended that it failed to construct and maintain the path properly. The city's motion to dismiss based on immunity was granted, and the injured party sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the city was immune under the recreational use statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.682. It rejected the injured party's argument that the application of &sect; 105.682 violated the remedy clause under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Because a negligence action against the city for injuries received in a public park was not recognized at common law, giving the city the benefit of the immunity provided by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.682 did not violate the remedy clause. Also, the court declined to consider whether the injured party could have brought an action against the city employees who designed and maintained the park under Or. Rev. Stat. 30.265 because the injured party failed to name any city employees in her complaint. Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, as amended, limited the jurisdiction of the court to the consideration of actual controversies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Metro passed an ordinance amending several provisions of its code, Metro, Or., Code &sect; 3.07.420(A)-(F). The amendment, among other things, moved the city's urban growth boundaries and directed the city to examine its industrial zoning districts and amend them if necessary to conform to Metro's direction. The court determined that the Metro ordinance amendments were authorized by Metro's charter, the charter was authorized by statute, and the statute was authorized by Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 14. Under its own charter, the constitution, and Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 268, Metro had the authority to enact the disputed ordinance as part of its regional framework plan, even when that ordinance imposed requirements on the city that the city would not choose for itself. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 268.380 and 268.390 unambiguously conferred authority on Metro to enact ordinances that required the city to enact ordinances bringing its land use regulations into conformity with Metro's. Also, Metro's ordinance amendments were not irreconcilable with the city's freedom to choose its own political form under Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(5) and Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected petitioner's claims as to his counsel's decision not to call an alibi witness because petitioner was not entitled to false testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court, Clackamas County, Oregon, for interfering with a peace officer.

The Oregon Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's decision and, on remand, the appellate court found that the statute was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had challenged Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.247(1)(b) on the basis that it was vague and overbroad. After the appellate court issued its initial opinion finding that the statute was constitutional, the Oregon Supreme Court issued an opinion in another case that stated that a disorderly conduct statute was overbroad because it prohibited constitutionally protected conduct or speech. On remand, the appellate court determined that if a statute proscribing disobedience to a lawful order to disperse was overbroad because it criminalized some constitutionally protected conduct, then a statute that criminalized the same conduct plus much more conduct, that is, disobedience to any lawful order, had to also be overbroad. The State argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.247(1)(b) did not explicitly mention any constitutionally protected conduct and was susceptible only to an as-applied challenge. The appellate court held that if speech-neutral statutes could not be challenged facially under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and that rule extended into the area of free assembly so as to override the logic of the supreme court, it was up to the supreme court to say so.</SPAN></P>

The fines, which totalled over $ 22,000, were within the range of authority under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;137.101(1).

In the present case, the victim was the daughter of the dead girl's father's girlfriend. At the time of the murder, the victim denied having been sexually abused by defendant. Years later, the victim alleged that defendant had sexually abused her some 11 to 13 years earlier. In the interim, the statute of limitations, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.125(2)(k) (amended 1991), was amended to provide that a prosecution for first degree sexual abuse must be commenced before a victim attained the age of 24 or within six years after the offense was reported. Defendant advanced two arguments: (1) the application of the statute's latest version violated ex post facto prohibitions; and (2) the current statute of limitations had run. Nevertheless, the retroactive extension of an unexpired statute of limitations was not an impermissible alteration of the rules of evidence. Moreover, the indictment, which was issued only a month after the victim reported to law enforcement, was not time-barred. On a different issue, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow, based on relevancy, examination about the murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had awarded custody of the child to respondent grandparents. On appeal, it was previously determined that the grandparents failed to rebut the statutory presumption, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.119 (2003) that appellant mother had acted in the child's best interests. The grandparents had appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court, which had remanded the matter for additional consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record revealed that the mother was 17 years old when the child was born. The grandparents' son, who was the child's father, was 15 years old. The mother left the child in the grandparents' care so that she could become the primary caretaker for the child's father. On remand, the appellate court remained satisfied that the grandparents had not shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the mother was unable or unwilling to provide adequate care for the child. In fact, the evidence showed that the relationship that developed between the mother and the child as a result of increasingly regular contacts had been positive and loving. The mother was an attentive and responsible parental figure. By leaving the child in the care of the grandparents, the mother acted in the child's best interests, not contrary to them, in encouraging and consenting to the relationship between grandparents and the child. The appellate court adhered to its original disposition of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court, once again, reversed the judgment. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which dismissed an action filed under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that defendant did not subscribe and file the oath of office set forth in Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 21. The question was whether a private party could bring an action under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.510. The court held in reviewing prior enacted versions of the Oregon statutes, that nothing raised doubt that actions under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.619 had to be commenced and prosecuted by the district attorney. The statutes creating the action that substituted for the common-law quo warranto action expressly required such actions to be commenced and prosecuted by the district attorney, and because the district attorney neither commenced nor prosecuted the action, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case. Through a contextual analysis and a review of the prior enacted versions of the same statute, the review supported the conclusion that the statutory actions had to be commenced and prosecuted by the district attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Washington County, Oregon, convicted defendant of eight counts of identity theft and one count of unlawful use of a computer. The trial court disallowed defendant's demurrer to the indictment under the identity theft statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.800, and denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.800 violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The appellate court had to analyze the statute only to the extent that it purported to criminalize creating or uttering the identification of another with the intent to deceive. A person who either created or uttered the identification of another and who intended that act to deceive had taken a substantial step toward accomplishing the deception; the person had attempted to achieve the harm. The identity theft statute focused on the attempt to cause a forbidden harm, that is, deceit. As used by the legislature in the context of identity theft, the term &quot;deceit&quot; denoted an attempt to obtain some benefit to which the deceiver was not lawfully entitled. Thus narrowed, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.800 did not reach a significant amount of privileged expression. Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied where officers had observed drug use and paraphernalia through the window and heard a person who, they reasonably believed, could be destroying the evidence. They were justified in conducting a &quot;sweep&quot; of the upstairs and in using information obtained thereby in their application for a warrant.</SPAN></P>

Admin. R. 581-021-0049(1)(b); (5) there was nothing in what that suggested that appellees were attempting to assert a right to attorney fees under that Or. Rev. stat. &sect; 20.107.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision revoked petitioner inmate's parole.

The inmate requested that the board reopen and reconsider his case under Or. Admin. R. 255-080-0010 to 255-080-0012, on the ground that the board had unconstitutionally applied an administrative rule. The board determined that the request was untimely. On appeal, the board first argued that the order was not a final order within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.335(1). Even if the forms of aggrievement cognizable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.480 applied under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.335(1)(a), the appellate court concluded that the inmate had not satisfied them in this case. The inmate was not affected or aggrieved within the meaning of Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class and sub-classes of employees, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which found in their actions for untimely payment of wages, that defendant employer owed union plaintiffs penalties for failing to pay their regular wages on time but not for failing to pay severance benefits on time. The trial court also found that defendant did not owe salaried plaintiffs for unauthorized insurance deductions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs maintained that the sale of defendant's facility amounted to a termination of their employment and that defendant failed to pay them regular wages and severance benefits. The court held: (1) the transition between plaintiffs' employment with defendant and their employment with the new owner was a termination by defendant for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 652.140(1), 652.150(3); (2) once the arbitrator rendered a decision construing the collective bargaining agreement, defendant's level of awareness of its obligation to pay severance benefits arose, and this was more than 30 days before the benefits were paid, and thus union plaintiffs were entitled to 30 days' penalty wages; and (3) Or. R. Civ. P. 32 K did not preclude class certification on the issue of defendant unlawfully withholding medical insurance premiums from their last paychecks, and the trial court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the issue because defendant's excess withholding violated not only Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.610(3)(a) but also Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.150, because the withholding resulted in late payment of wages on termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the claim for penalty wages was modified to begin the penalty period on November 11, 1999, and to include prejudgment interest. The court reversed the judgment against plaintiffs on the issue of unauthorized deductions of insurance premiums, and on their claim for penalty wages based on failure to timely pay severance. The court otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, the claimant injured his knees while working for his employer. The claim was closed in 1987. In 2000, at the claimant's request, the Board, on its own motion, ordered that the claim be reopened for reconstructive surgery and payment of temporary total disability. After surgery, when the claimant missed a scheduled physical therapy appointment and failed to attend an examination with his physician, the physician notified the employer that if the claimant did not attend a rescheduled appointment he would consider the claimant's right knee medically stationary as of the date of the missed appointment. When the claimant missed another appointment, the employer successfully requested that the Board, under the authority of Or. Admin. R. 438-012-0035(5), suspend the claimant's temporary disability benefits retroactive to December 19, 2000, until he fully participated in his own recovery. The court affirmed the order, finding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.325 specifically provided that the procedures of that statute apply to the suspension of benefits awarded in the Board's own motion jurisdiction and that the Board's adoption of Or. Admin. R. 438-012-0035(5) was within its authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon) that dismissed her appeal of a municipal court decision that convicted her of multiple violations of Lowell, Or., Ordinance No. 130, pertaining to owners of dangerous buildings. The City argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal under the three statutes that granted appellate jurisdiction, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 221.360, 138.050, and 138.057.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had argued that the municipal court lacked jurisdiction under the new city charter to hear the ordinance violations complaint and that the fine imposed exceeded the municipal court's authority. Defendant also argued for the first time on appeal that the sentenced imposed did not comport with due process, and thus was unconstitutional. The circuit court had dismissed defendant's appeal. On review, the court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138.050 and 138.57 were inapplicable because they did not apply to cases arising from convictions in municipal court for municipal code violations. The court held that where the conviction was entered by a municipal court that was not a court of record, the sole potential source of appellate jurisdiction was Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 221.360 as construed in City of Salem v. Polanski, which required a challenge to the constitutionality of an ordinance. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction under &sect; 221.360 because defendant's constitutional challenge was not cognizable on appeal since it was never raised and preserved before the municipal court or the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The post-conviction court found that petitioner was not informed of the potential incarceration beyond the 226 months stated in the plea petition. Petitioner asserted that she was denied adequate assistance of counsel under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court reversed, agreeing that the post-conviction court's findings and the judgment were internally inconsistent because petitioner sought relief under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.530(1)(a), and the court granted relief finding that petitioner was not informed of the maximum sentences to which her pleas expose her. That was not consistent with the determinations that petitioner knowingly and voluntarily made her pleas. Because the evidence supported the finding that petitioner was not informed of the maximum sentences, it followed that she was denied adequate assistance of counsel. The trial court sentenced her to a total incarcerative sentence in excess of the putative maximum sentence set out in the plea petition. Accordingly, petitioner was prejudiced by the constitutional violation. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.530(1)(a) required the post-conviction court, in granting relief, to treat petitioner's convictions as void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Oregon, defendant pled guilty to second-degree robbery, a so-called &quot;Measure 11&quot; crime, or one that carried a statutory minimum sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700. Defendant appealed, asserting the trial court erred in ruling that she did not qualify for a lesser sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.712(2)(d), which provided a discretionary exception to a Measure 11 sentence for second-degree robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's plea to second-degree robbery was based on an aiding and abetting theory. Second-degree robbery was a Measure 11 offense with a mandatory minimum sentence of 70 months, which was what defendant received. However, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.712(1)(a), the sentencing court could depart from the mandatory minimum sentence for second degree robbery if certain requirements under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.712(2)(d) were met. The trial court found defendant did not meet the criterion in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.712(2)(d)(C), because her codefendant was armed with a &quot;deadly weapon.&quot; However, the appellate court did not reach the merits of defendant's argument that the trial court erred as to the latter finding, because under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050(1), her sentence was not appealable. To be appealable after a plea of guilty or no contest under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050(1), a &quot;disposition,&quot; (within the meaning of that term as defined in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.053) had to either be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, or exceed the maximum allowable by law. Defendant's sentence did not exceed the legal maximum and the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to review the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Malheur County Circuit Court, Oregon, which convicted him of four counts of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree, in violation of Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised numerous assignments of error. The instant court addressed only two of defendant's arguments: (1) whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on four charges of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree; and (2) whether the trial court erred in imposing upward departure sentences on a number of the convictions. The instant court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal, holding that the provision of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.684(1)(a)(A) concerning possession of child pornography with the intent to print that material did not require proof of defendant's intent to show or distribute the child pornography to another person. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the four charges of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree at issue on appeal. However, the trial court erred in imposing the departure sentences, which violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant held up a bar. Defendant shot at pursuing police officers and ultimately was convicted of attempted first-degree assault with a firearm, with an upward departure sentence of 72 months. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in rejecting his argument that the upward departure sentence was unconstitutional. The State suggested that the sentence imposed for a prior conviction was encompassed in the &quot;fact&quot; of the prior conviction, and because sentencing was not done by a jury in Oregon, consideration of facts pertaining to sentences for prior convictions did not intrude on any jury function. The appellate court ruled that the upward departure sentence was unconstitutional. The crucial fact at issue was whether defendant was on supervision at a particular point in time after that prior conviction had been entered. Even if the State were correct that the &quot;fact&quot; of the prior conviction included the sentence imposed for that conviction, it would not encompass facts concerning when defendant actually served either the prison term or the supervision term of that sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The millwright, who used medical marijuana to help him sleep, challenged the trial court's conclusions that: (1) mitigating measures had to be considered when determining whether or not an individual was disabled and therefore protected by Oregon disability law; and (2) the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act, specifically Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.340(2), exempted employers from accommodating employees reporting to work with evidence of marijuana in their systems. The instant court concluded that the trial court incorrectly granted summary judgment insofar as it reasoned as a matter of law that the millwright was not a disabled person based on the fact that a mitigating measure--use of marijuana--alleviated his difficulty sleeping. The proper issue was whether the millwright's sleep, a major life activity, was substantially limited without mitigating measures. As to that issue, there was a genuine issue of a material fact. Because the millwright did not engage in the medical use of marijuana in the workplace, the trial court erred in concluding that &sect; 475.340(2) excused the former employer from reasonably accommodating the millwright and granting summary judgment on that basis.</SPAN></P>

Defendant demurred to the charge arguing that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court allowed the demurrer agreeing with defendant's argument. The trial court's decision was reversed on appeal, and the matter was taken to the Oregon Supreme Court. The supreme court remanded the matter in light of a recent decision regarding the constitutionality of a similar statutory provision. The court reconsidered the matter and noted that a statute was unconstitutionally overbroad if it prohibited a significant amount of constitutionally protected conduct or speech and it was not susceptible to a narrowing construction that would have conformed to legislative intent. The court concluded that the provisions of &sect; 162.247(1) were constitutionally vague and violated the provisions of Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 26, which protected free speech and the right to peaceably assemble. Accordingly, the statute was declared unconstitutional, and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate brought a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that his sentence for felon in possession of a firearm should have been vacated because it exceeded the statutory maximum sentence for a Class C felony, as provided by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.605 and Or. Admin. R. 213-005-0002(4). The court affirmed the denial of the petition, stating that it disagreed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose a sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.530(1)(b). Although Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(2)(d) precluded appellate review of the inmate's sentence, it did not follow therefrom that he was precluded from withdrawing his plea made pursuant to the agreement before sentencing in the trial court. He did not allege any other circumstances to show why he reasonably could not have been expected to raise his objection before sentencing. The court therefore concluded that, although he alleged a valid substantive ground for post-conviction relief, he did not satisfy the procedural requirement of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.550(2). He also did not demonstrate that any inadequacy of his trial counsel led to a different result in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for third-degree assault after spitting at a staff member at a youth correctional facility, where defendant was incarcerated. He pled guilty. Defendant's presumptive sentence under the sentencing guidelines was 13 to 14 months. The trial court determined that defendant's case was appropriate for departure from the sentencing guidelines based on evidence that defendant had been resistive to treatment and sanctioned on other occasions, and that the spitting incident included throwing a chair through a window and breaking it along with &quot;lots of inappropriate statements and behavior.&quot; The trial court sentenced defendant to 26 months, followed by two years of post-prison supervision. On appeal, the court found that the trial court committed plain error in imposing the sentence, finding that the waiver of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial implicit in the guilty plea did not include a waiver of the right to have a jury determine aggravating factors that would support a departure. The court found that there was no basis in the record for the inference that defendant intentionally waived the right to jury determination of the aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver, who was severely injured in an accident while driving a car manufactured by the manufacturer, appealed from a judgment dismissing her claims against the manufacturer pursuant to Or.

The court affirmed the trial court's disposition with respect to two of the driver's three specifications of negligence and her warranty claims. However, her remaining specification of negligence alleged conduct that was not subject to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.905(1) (2001) and, from the pleadings, the court could not determine whether that specification was barred by the applicable statutes of limitations and ultimate repose, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12.110 and 12.115. Because specification &quot;C&quot; did not disclose the date of the &quot;act or omission complained of,&quot; the pleadings did not show that the allegation was barred under &sect; 12.115.

It was significant, albeit not dispositive, that petitioner's criminal trial counsel raised and preserved an objection to the imposition of the multiple sentences for aggravated murder. At the time counsel raised the objection, there was no authoritative decision by the Oregon Supreme Court. It would not have been unreasonable for appellate counsel to have raised the already preserved issue before the instant court in order to seek review by the Supreme Court of a novel issue of statutory construction. Nothing in this record suggested that appellate counsel's failure in that regard was excused by anything even approaching futility. Petitioner failed to establish that his challenge could not reasonably have been asserted on direct appeal. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied post-conviction relief on that ground.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defendant did not raise any constitutionally based objection in the trial court to the imposition of consecutive sentences; the alleged unpreserved error was not reviewable under Or. R. App. P. 5.45(1), because the legal point was not obvious. Further, the imposition of single sentences that exceeded the statutorily prescribed maximum for particular crimes, and making a sentence for one crime consecutive to a sentence for a different crime did not implicate the &quot;statutory maximum&quot; for either crime in any obvious way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant appeal was the third time the underlying dispute had been brought before the courts. On review, the owners challenged the board's waiver determination and asserted that the consents obtained by the City were invalid, as they were obtained before the City reconfigured the area to be annexed. The appellate court found that the board's analysis did not account for one of the land owners who was not a party to the first prior case in the underlying dispute; nor could that owner's failure to participate in the first prior suit be itself deemed a waiver, as the board explicitly acknowledged in the first prior suit that the City failed to comply with the notice requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.763(1). For similar reasons, the remaining land owners did not waive their constitutional challenge. However, the appellate court also held that the consents obtained by the City were not invalid, as Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.170 did not require consents to be reexecuted when the City altered the description of the areas to be annexed before it finally proclaimed the annexation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment concluding that the land owners waived their constitutional objections to the triple-majority method of annexation was reversed and remanded to the board for reconsideration of the land owners' constitutional arguments; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of disorderly conduct: the first alleged that he engaged in tumultuous and threatening behavior in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(a), and the second count alleged that he made unreasonable noise in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(b). The Circuit Court of Lake County, Oregon, convicted defendant on both counts and denied his motions for judgment of acquittal. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to convict him on each count of disorderly conduct. As to the first count, the appellate court found there was no physical impact at all; defendant merely gestured angrily. That did not constitute &quot;the use of physical force.&quot; Thus, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that defendant engaged in physical conduct that was immediately likely to produce the use of physical force by defendant. As such, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct count under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(a). However, denial for judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct count under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(b) was proper as the question of defendant's intent, whether his parting outburst was intended to be communicative or was merely a guise to disturb, was a quintessential jury question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant embezzled half a million dollars over several years in the course of her employment as a bookkeeper for her elderly employers. The Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) imposed upward departure sentences in two cases that were consolidated for appeal. Defendant appealed the sentences, some of which were concurrent and some of which were consecutive, that added up to a total period of incarceration of 88 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant made three principal arguments: the trial court erred in relying on &quot;abuse of trust&quot; as a sentencing factor to support certain departure sentences; with respect to both cases, under Apprendi, the trial court could not impose upward departure sentences because the enhancement factors on which it relied were not based on the facts to which defendant pled guilty; again with respect to both cases, under the reasoning of State v. Quinn, reliance on certain upward departure factors pursuant to the sentencing guidelines violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The appellate court concluded that, under Blakely, the imposition of upward departure sentences in each of the consolidated cases was erroneous. It concluded that, consistently with Blakely, the relevant &quot;prescribed statutory maximum&quot; under the Oregon sentencing guidelines was the presumptive sentence that the court determined based on the offender's criminal history and crime seriousness score. Guidelines departure sentences, which required judicial findings of fact and were not, under the current scheme, based on facts found by the jury, did not comport with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

He cross-petitioned, raising challenges to the various aspects of the order. The court reversed and remanded, finding in favor of the district and concluding that the FDAB did not adequately explain its reasoning with respect to the conclusion that the teacher's dismissal was unreasonable. Further, even if the charge against the teacher was eventually dismissed, the record clearly showed that she pled no contest to criminal mischief in the first degree, a felony, was placed on 36 months' probation, and was ordered to pay restitution. In light of those facts, the FDAB failed to sufficiently explain why it determined that the school board's decision to dismiss the teacher was clearly an excessive remedy. Contrary to the teacher's assertions, the FDAB did not rely solely on the fact that she had attempted suicide in reaching the conclusion that her conduct constituted immorality.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 8, plaintiffs failed to challenge the alternative basis of the trial court's ruling under Or. Const. art.

On remand, the Court of Appeals was required to determine whether that award of punitive damages was consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in light of recent United States Supreme Court precedent. The Court of Appeals held that the award of $ 79.5 million in punitive damages did not violate the Due Process Clause, because the amount of the award was reasonable and proportionate to the wrong inflicted on the decedent and the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an amended judgment of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which altered his sentence on his convictions for criminally negligent homicide, felony failure to perform the duties of a driver, and tampering with physical evidence. The convictions were entered upon defendant's plea of guilty. The State filed a motion to determine whether the court had jurisdiction over the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravamen of defendant's argument on appeal was that the amended sentence imposed was not imposed consistently with statutory requirements, because the trial court lacked authority to modify a sentence that had already been executed, in light of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.010(6). The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050 contained provisions limiting both appealability and reviewability and that the proper disposition of an appeal in which an appellant failed to make the colorable showing required by &sect; 138.050(1) was dismissal. To be appealable after a plea of guilty or no contest under &sect; 138.050(1), a &quot;disposition,&quot; within the meaning of that term as defined in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.053, had to either be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual or exceed the maximum allowable by law because it was not imposed consistently with statutory requirements. The court found that defendant's challenge concerned a &quot;disposition,&quot; which by definition included imposition of a sentence pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.053(1)(a). Thus, defendant's argument was one that was cognizable as pertaining to a &quot;disposition&quot; that exceeded the maximum allowable by law under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed the motion to determine jurisdiction and ruled that the appeal could proceed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 34.040(1), petitioners, a nonprofit organization and an individual county resident, brought a petition for a writ of review challenging a decision by respondent Board of County Commissioners of Hood River County (county) to enter into a land exchange agreement with respondent limited partnership. The Circuit Court, Hood River County (Oregon), dismissed the petition. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the petition based on its determination that the challenged decision was not &quot;quasi-judicial.&quot; Petitioners alleged that the county's decision did not comport with several statutes pertaining to exchanges of county lands, including Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 273.335, and, consequently, the county failed to follow the procedure applicable to the matter. The court reversed the dismissal, concluding that the land exchange decision was &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.040. The court stated that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 275.335 required the county to apply preexisting criteria concerning value to concrete facts concerning the particular proposed land exchange and also prescribed certain procedural requirements for making that determination. Additionally, the court concluded that the resident had standing to pursue a writ of review. The resident specifically alleged how the development of a resort would likely affect his farming operation. Finally, the court denied the partnership's renewed motion to dismiss the appeal, stating that the motion was predicated upon consideration of evidentiary materials that had been proffered for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of dismissal and remanded the case. The court further denied the partnership's renewed motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three Oregon voters (voters), sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, the Secretary of State for the State of Oregon (secretary), in the voters' action for declaratory and injunctive relief arguing that an initiative petition could not be certified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary certified an initiative petition for circulation, even though the text of the petition set out only the wording proposed to be added to existing statutes and did not include the text of the statutes to be amended. The voters initiated an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the initiative petition could be certified because it failed to include the text of the statutes as they would read if the proposed amendments were to be approved by the voters. The voters argued that the full text of the &quot;proposed law&quot; within the meaning of Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d) referred to the full text of the law as amended. On appeal the court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the secretary and remanded for an entry of summary judgment in favor of the voters. The court stated that it seemed likely that, in adopting art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d), the voters intended to require publication of the full text of the statute as it would appear if amended, regardless of whether the amendment was proposed by the legislature of by initiative. Thus, the grant of summary judgment in favor of the secretary was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers brought an action against the State, alleging that it incorrectly determined the amount of money available for &quot;kicker&quot; tax refunds to taxpayers for the 1999-2001 biennium, reducing the &quot;kicker&quot; tax refund by about one-third. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that Medicaid Upper Payment Limit funds (MUPL funds) were received from Oregon General Fund revenue sources during the biennium and, consequently, had to be included in the &quot;kicker&quot; calculation. The MUPL funds were revenues received from General Fund revenue sources for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291.349(4). Regardless of the Oregon Legislature's later disposition of the funds, they were received from General Fund revenue sources when they were properly placed in the General Fund pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.110 in the first instance. That the Oregon Legislature redirected the funds elsewhere before the end of the biennium did not alter the practical and statutory reality that the revenues were received from a General Fund revenue source.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trucking companies brought a declaratory action seeking an injunction and a refund of taxes paid against defendants, the State and the department of transportation et al, asserting that aspects of the manner in which the State taxed heavy trucks that used its highways violated the dormant Commerce Clause. The Circuit Court of Marion County, Oregon, ruled in the State's favor and dismissed the action. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the companies contended the statutory exceptions to the weight-mile system for taxing heavy trucks (the flat fee options under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 825.480 and the fuel tax exception for farm vehicles under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 805.310) violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; they argued that the exceptions placed interstate commerce at a disadvantage when it competed with intrastate commerce. The appellate court found that the flat fee options discriminated between interstate and intrastate carriers whose businesses differed only because of their relationship to state boundaries, and the discrimination operated to the detriment of the interstate carrier. The flat fee options did not apportion the tax burden among the states where the interstate carrier operated, and they therefore failed the &quot;internal consistency&quot; test. However, the appellate court also found that the companies failed to show that the fuel tax discriminated between interstate and intrastate carriers; if every state adopted the fuel tax exception, there would not be any malapportionment or discrimination between interstate and intrastate carriers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the flat fee options and remanded with instructions to enter declaratory judgment declaring the flat fee options unconstitutional and to award any appropriate relief; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The citizen filed a cross-petition for judicial review, which the city and trust moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to annex certain property and applied particular zoning designations to that property. The citizen appealed certain of those annexation and zoning decisions to LUBA. LUBA remanded the annexation and zoning designation because it found that the city failed to meet certain annexation criteria in its comprehensive plan. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the justiciability requirements articulated in case law did not apply to proceedings before LUBA because it was not a court in which the constitution vested judicial power. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.805 did not require LUBA to apply the justiciability doctrine in the manner that the court had applied it in case law. Because the citizen appeared before the local government and filed a notice of intent to appeal, he had standing to appeal to LUBA under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.830(2). Accordingly, LUBA did not err in refusing to dismiss the citizen's appeal on the ground that he lacked standing under case law. The citizen, as a respondent on review, did not need to establish that a decision would have had a practical effect on him. However, he lacked standing to pursue his cross-motion, which the court dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Rather, the RLUIPA provided standards for the imposition of land use regulations on religious entities. Because the board did not interpret or apply the RLUIPA in a manner entirely exempting the church from land use regulations, the board's order remanding the case to the city for further determination was not erroneous. The city did not entirely prevent the church from building any church at all in the desired location. Rather, the burden imposed on the church was the burden of being prevented from implementing the particular design proposal at issue. The city's ordinances, as applied in the city's decision, did not impose a substantial burden on the church's religious exercise.

The trial court determined that retrial as to all three counts was barred by the statutory double jeopardy provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.515 and that, even if &sect; 131.515 did not preclude retrial as to all three charges, retrial of the felony murder charge against defendant was precluded by constitutional double jeopardy protections. The court disagreed, reversed, and remanded for retrial of the three dismissed counts. The trial court's erroneous dismissal of the indictment did not operate to bar retrial where the prior trial was, in fact, properly terminated based on the jury's inability to reach a verdict. In that regard, defendant was in precisely the same position as he would have been if the trial court had never erroneously dismissed the indictment under &sect; 131.515.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had applied to the city to construct four billboards on property zoned for commercial and industrial uses. The proposed billboards were each 14 by 48 feet, or a total of 672 square feet per billboard. The city's building official denied the request based on advice from the city attorney that billboards were not a permitted land use within the city limits. LUBA reversed the city's denial of the application. LUBA concluded that the city's denial violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 20. The appellate court affirmed LUBA's reversal, but also held that the reversal did not mean that the city had to approve the company's application. The appellate court agreed that the city's municipal code did not permit all signs except for those specifically prohibited. It also agreed with LUBA that the city's denial violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, as it was impossible to apply Gladstone, Or. Mun. Code &sect; 17.52 without inquiry into the content of the proposed sign to determine if it was permitted. Thus, the city failed to apply any content-neutral distinction that would permit it to deny the company's application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The mother maintained a continuing presence in the child's life, although living separately from the grandparents. Although the father maintained consistent contact with the child, his financial contributions toward her support were sporadic. The court held that the grandparents, by reference to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.119(4)(b), had rebutted the statutory presumption that the father acted in the child's best interest. The grandparents had acted as the child's primary caretakers for five years, and no other relationship in the child's life qualitatively approached this primary bond. While the father's relationship was warm and affectionate, he never visited her school, talked with her teachers, checked with her doctors, or assumed any traditional parental role. The father's determination to preclude contact with the grandparents would, if realized, be detrimental to the child. The award of custody to the grandparents was in the child's best interests. Constitutionally sufficient compelling circumstances existed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 426.005(1)(d)(A), (B) based upon findings that he was a danger to himself and unable to provide for his basic personal needs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's mother and sister reported that the patient was not taking his medications, was hallucinating, was not eating properly, and could not keep his house clean. At the civil commitment hearing, the patient behaved in an agitated manner and stated that he wanted to subpoena his sons to testify. The trial court, after stating that there was a substantial likelihood that the sons' evidence would not be helpful, found that the patient was unable to care for himself. The patient's counsel did not object to the statement that the sons' evidence would not be helpful. The court concluded that the trial court did not deny the patient an opportunity to subpoena witnesses. Under Or. R. Civ. P. 55(C)(1)(a)(ii), counsel could have issued a subpoena without the trial court's involvement. The trial court's statement amounted to an evidentiary ruling that, even if subpoenaed, the sons would not be permitted to testify. Because no offer of proof was made as to the content of expected testimony, the issue was not reviewable. The court noted that any error was harmless because the testimony and the patient's agitated behavior at the hearing sufficiently supported the commitment order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commitment order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied plaintiff voters' and plaintiff political parties' request for attorney fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The voters and political parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A census showed a shift in population, requiring redistricting of congressional districts. A plan was passed by the legislature, but the governor vetoed the plan, and there was no override. Two groups of voters, representing the interests of each political party, filed actions alleging claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In its refusal to grant attorney fees, the trial court determined that no party was successful. The voters asserted that the trial court erred in its determination that they had not prevailed and in its application of the special circumstances exception in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The appellate court determined the voters prevailed in this action, even though they failed to obtain the exact relief that they had sought. As to whether the special circumstances exception applied, the appellate court disagreed with the trial court's analysis. First, that the voters interests were partisan was immaterial. Furthermore, the defendants, were not just innocent bystanders in a turf war. The realities of the situation rendered the special circumstances exception inapposite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to determined the reasonableness of the fees requested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees sued defendant county for breach of contract and wrongful deduction from wages, seeking to recover retirement contributions that were deducted under an unconstitutional law. The appeals court held that plaintiffs stated a wage claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ballot Measure 8 required public employees to contribute six percent of their compensation to retirement accounts. It also prohibited employers from paying the contributions. Following its enactment, the county adopted an ordinance eliminating its payment of contributions but giving employees a 5.7 percent pay increase. The state supreme court later declared Measure 8 unconstitutional. The employees asserted that defendant violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.610(3) when it deducted six percent from their wages for retirement contributions while Measure 8 was in force. The jury found that the employees were entitled to damages for breach of contract in the amount of .3 percent of their total wages, and the trial court applied the same measure of damages to the wage claim. In affirming, the court reasoned that implicit in the jury determination was that the 5.7 percent salary increase was a substitute for the lost pension and that defendant's contractual obligation was to pay the pre-Measure 8 salaries plus a six percent pension contribution. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.615, which allowed recovery of actual damages, setting damages on the wage claim based on the contract damages was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, as a matter of statutory construction, Or. Rev.

The appellate court noted that, by its terms, the statute provided that, in determining the criminal history score of persons convicted of felony DUII, the court had to consider every two previous misdemeanor DUII convictions to be equivalent to one person felony conviction. It did not contemplate exclusion of the first three convictions from a defendant's criminal history score. Nor did Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010(5) provide contextual evidence of a different legislative intent. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.012(2) unambiguously provided that all previous DUII convictions had to be counted in a defendant's criminal history score. The statute did not impose a separate punishment for defendant's prior DUII offenses in violation of the Fifth Amendment or Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The dual consideration of defendant's previous convictions in determining his punishment did not offend the protections against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and a realty company, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Marion County (Oregon), which entered summary judgment in favor of respondent owner by reversing and remanding Woodburn, Or., Res. 1554 in an action seeking a combined writ of review and a declaratory judgment. The city was ordered to reimburse the owner for a fee imposed based on a private road improvement. The owner also sought review of the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realty company incurred certain costs when improving a road to serve several stores. The realty company never sought the formation of a local improvement district, which had been contemplated by the city. Later, the city adopted Woodburn, Or., Ordinance 2237 to form a reimbursement district. It also adopted Woodburn, Or., Res. 1554 to create the district in which the stores were located. The owner paid the fee assessed under protest. He later filed an action seeking declaratory relief and a petition for a writ of review. When the trial court found that Res. 1554 was not supported by substantial evidence, the city and the realty company sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the city was permitted to adopt its own method of cost sharing. The procedures set forth for the financing of local improvements were not exclusive; therefore, Woodburn, Or., Ordinance 2237 did not conflict with state law. The court finally determined that Woodburn, Or., Res. 1554 was supported by substantial evidence, based on a public works director's report. However, a remand was necessary because it was unclear whether all of the owner's property should have been included.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to delete the award of restitution.

Custody was awarded to the grandparents and the mother received visitation. The mother appealed, challenging the constitutionality of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.119, as written and as applied to her. The court found the constitutionality of &sect; 109.119 was not preserved for review and its constitutionality as applied did not need to be addressed because the decision below was inconsistent with &sect; 109.119 and required reversal. The grandparents' argument rested on a showing that they had concerns about the mother's ability to parent, including drug and alcohol use and unsanitary living conditions. The court found these events were shown to have existed in the past, but did not exist when the petition for custody was filed. The court found the grandparents did not adequately rebut the presumption in favor of the mother's custody, as provided under &sect; 109.119(4)(b). Since the mother's counter-petition for custody was not determined below, remand was required.</SPAN></P>

She could not find the operator, but was greeted by the cook, who was not a qualified caregiver. The monitor visited a resident's room with the cook. The resident asked for help to use the bathroom, at which time the cook closed the resident's door. Later, the operator appeared and claimed that she had been in the resident's room hiding and taping the monitor's activities. No tape was produced at trial. An administrative decision was issued that found that the operator violated various rules in leaving residents without a qualified caregiver. The trial court reversed the decision. The court reversed. The court first held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal, even though the trial court's decision was issued in two judgments entered on the same day and the notice of appeal had only one judgment attached thereto. The notice of appeal was sufficient under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19.250(1)(c). The court found that a proper inference could be drawn from the evidence that the cook assisted the resident, although she was not a qualified caregiver.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), granted summary judgment to defendant State of Oregon dismissing plaintiff inmate's negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims for noneconomic damages. The trial court ruled under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.650 that the inmate could not recover noneconomic damages in the absence of establishing economic damages. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate suffered from a medical problem related to his feet. For a time, the inmate received medically prescribed orthopedic shoes from the State. The inmate filed a complaint after the State refused to provide the shoes. The inmate alleged claims in negligence for failing to provide the shoes and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. He also alleged that, as a result of the State's conduct, he was unable to work, unable to receive pay for his work and, ultimately, unable to purchase the necessary footwear from his own funds. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the State. The court rejected the inmate's argument that &sect; 30.650 subjected him to civil death. The court stated that &sect; 30.650 recognized implicitly the capacity of an inmate to sue for both economic and noneconomic damages. The statute merely operated to bar the award of noneconomic damages unless the inmate also established that he or she suffered economic damages. Additionally, the court held that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 provided the inmate with no relief because his action was barred at common law and he would have had no remedy due to the State's sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 197.015(10)(d) applied to its conditional use application and exempted its gatherings from land use regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was zoned as high-value farmland, but had a conditional use permit for a private airfield. Petitioner sought an administrative determination that it could expand its airport operation, proposing to hold private gatherings with contests involving dropping objects from aircraft with the intent of striking a target on the ground. LUBA remanded the issue of whether the social gatherings might be &quot;incidental&quot; to activities specified as permissible in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 836.616(2)(a), as the owner had not described the nature of the social gatherings in sufficient detail. The court affirmed that conclusion without discussion. The court also affirmed the finding that there was no exemption under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.015(10)(d) that applied to gatherings &quot;not anticipated to continue for more than 120 hours in any three-month period.&quot; Petitioner asserted that phrase referred to multiple events with a total accumulated hour limit, whereas the county contended that it referred to a single event of not more than 120 hours. The court agreed with the county. Given the singular subject, &quot;a mass gathering,&quot; the conditions were likely intended to apply to a single gathering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured when defendant drove through a stop sign at an intersection and collided with plaintiff's car. Plaintiff brought an action against defendant for negligence, seeking economic and noneconomic damages. Defendant asserted as an affirmative defense that Or. Rev.

The trial court granted plaintiff's motion to strike defendant's affirmative defense and denied defendant's motion for summary judgment. The trial court awarded plaintiff noneconomic damages. On appeal, the court explained that &sect; 18.592(1) prescribed an additional factual issue for the trier of fact to decide in motor vehicle cases, namely, whether the plaintiff had liability insurance at the time of the accident. If the trier of fact determined that the plaintiff did not have such coverage, it could not reach the issue of noneconomic damages. Hence, the trial court erred in awarding plaintiff noneconomic damages. Finally, the court held that the removal of the issue of noneconomic damages from the jury did not violate Or. Const. art.

The timber company contended the State took its property without compensation by refusing to permit it to log timberland identified as a nesting site for Bald Eagles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The timber company acquired a 40-acre parcel of forested land. State employees reported seeing two adult bald eagles at a nest site on the land as well as an unoccupied bald eagle nest. The timber company eventually was allowed to harvest no closer than 400 feet from the bald eagle nest and to preserve 50 percent of the live trees between 400 and 500 feet from the nest. Following the annual bald eagle nesting season, the timber company observed that the bald eagle nest on the Beaver Tract apparently was no longer occupied. Its proposal to harvest the timber on the remaining nine acres was denied. The appellate court rejected the argument that the timber company waived the right to assert a takings claim. It also rejected the argument that the whole parcel rule applied. The restriction on the timber company's ability to log the remaining land deprived it of all economically viable use of that parcel. It necessarily followed that the timber company established the requisites of its regulatory takings claim under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The trial court therefore erred in granting the State's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became verbally abusive when she was asked by a train conductor to purchase a ticket.

When the credit card transaction was refused, she became very agitated, and four police officers boarded the train, asked her to leave, and when she refused, arrested her. The court affirmed the disorderly conduct conviction without discussion. The court agreed with defendant, however, that, as a matter of law, her conduct was not an &quot;unauthorized exercise in official duties&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.415(1)(b). The court commented that a jury could have found that defendant withdrew her badge and deliberately handled it so that the conductor would be aware that she was a police officer and that she wanted some form of benefit to flow from that awareness. However, to satisfy the statute, a defendant had to act in an official capacity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business and individuals appealed the grant of summary judgment by the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), in favor of defendant Oregon Board of Tax Service Examiners. The Board notified the business it was initiating proceedings to determine whether the business engaged in unlicensed tax consultation. The business then sought a declaration that federal law preempted the applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board sent a notice of a proposed action and a right to a hearing alleging the business prepared or helped prepare personal income tax returns without a license and the individuals falsely held themselves out as licensed tax consultants. The Board moved to dismiss the business's judicial action, as the Oregon Administrative Procedure Act (APA) required the business to raise a preemption argument before the board. Thus, the dispute centered around whether the Board had authority to decide the preemption claim. The appellate court held there was no reason to distinguish the preemption claim from any other issue or defense that the Board had to resolve in the course of deciding whether to impose a civil penalty. The resolution of those issues was necessary to the decision of whether to impose a civil penalty as allowed by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 673.730(7). Under the plain language of &sect; 673.730, the Board had the authority to decide the preemption claim. The business could not circumvent the APA by seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Based on those convictions, the trial court sentenced him to prison. Before his parole release date, respondent Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (board) ordered that he should be designated as a predatory sex offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimed that the board failed to provide him with constitutionally adequate notice. The board notified petitioner that it had made a preliminary decision to designate him as a predatory sex offender because, among other things, he had a history of sex crimes. The board, however, did not tell petitioner, until after it had made its final decision, what sex crimes he allegedly had committed, when those crimes allegedly occurred, or with whom. Without that information or some process that would permit him to discover that information, petitioner was in no position to respond--in writing or otherwise--to the board's determination that he had a history of sex crimes. The same problem inhered in the board's preliminary determination that petitioner used weapons or threats. Because the board failed to provide petitioner with constitutionally adequate notice, its order was reversed. Petitioner argued before the board that a condition of his parole was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give fair notice of the materials it prohibited. The condition provided a procedural mechanism for removing any doubt about which materials it prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged, in the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), with refusing to obey a lawful order by a peace officer, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.247(1)(b). Defendant demurred to the information, arguing that the statutory phrase &quot;lawful order&quot; was overbroad and facially vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the information, defendant refused to step down from a truck when ordered to do so. The trial court greatened defendant's demurrer to the information on the grounds that the statutory phrase &quot;lawful order&quot; was overbroad and facially vague. The appellate court reversed. The appellate court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.247(1)(b) required compliance only with lawful orders and could not, by its terms, be overbroad. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that in order to succeed on a facial vagueness claim, a party had to show that a statute was unconstitutionally vague in all of its possible applications. As defendant could not meet that standard, or demonstrate why that standard would not apply, the statute was not vague. Additionally, a facial vagueness test to &sect; 162.247(1)(b), had previously been rejected by the appellate court. Finally, the phrase &quot;lawful order&quot; provided a meaningful standard that was reasonably capable of determination.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the trial court erred in calculating defendant's criminal history score. The State claimed that, under amendments to the sentencing guidelines approved in 1993 and 1995, the single judicial proceeding rule no longer applied and prior convictions for resisting arrest were reclassified as &quot;person&quot; misdemeanors. Defendant argued that the amendments to the sentencing guidelines were void, as the legislature did not comply with Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 in amending the statutes. The appellate court held that, while defendant's Article IV, &sect; 22 challenge to the 1993 and 1995 amendments to the sentencing guidelines was timely, those amendments were not invalid because of a failure to comply with the publication requirement of that constitutional provision. As the sentencing guidelines were not &quot;acts&quot; within the definition of &sect; 22, and the 1995 statute that defendant challenged repealed a prior rule as opposed to amending it, the provision did not apply.</SPAN></P>

After a citation was issued, one of the officers blocked defendant from re-entering his vehicle. At that time, defendant was asked for permission to search the car. After drugs were found inside, defendant was arrested. At trial, defendant's motion to suppress evidence was granted. The State then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the officers were allowed to request permission to search for contraband under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 810.410(3)(e). However, the relevant question was whether, at the time of the request, defendant was being unlawfully detained. The evidence showed that one of the officers prevented defendant from re-entering his car. Under those circumstances, a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. However, defendant could have still given valid consent even if the detention was unlawful. Because the State never offered any evidence of voluntariness at the trial court level, it was unable to raise the issue on appeal. Therefore, the suppression motion was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

The inmate sought judicial review of a board order that postponed his parole release date for 24 months based on the board's determination that the inmate suffered from a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community. The inmate filed a motion for leave to proceed that raised two questions of law. The court allowed the motion for leave to proceed and concluded that a substantial question of law was presented by the inmate's motion for leave to proceed with judicial review. The inmate needed to identify a question of law that was more than seemingly plausible, but did not need to show that he would prevail on the question of law. The inmate's second question of law was a substantial one, as the inmate cited cases that appeared to support his position, but the legislature enacted legislation that arguably could be inconsistent with that case law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Multnomah County, Oregon, convicted defendant for failure to report as a sex offender, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.599, and denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to determine whether his waiver of a jury trial was knowing and voluntary. Defendant argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.597(1)(a) did not require him to notify the authorities when he moved out of state. The appellate court found that because the trial court received a written jury waiver from defendant, it was not required to inquire whether defendant's waiver was voluntary.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.597(1)(a)(B) was clear: when a sex offender moved into Oregon, he or she had to notify the police within 10 days of a change of residence.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.600 was not inconsistent with the conclusion that an Oregon resident sex offender who moved out of the state was required to report the move.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.604 was consistent with &sect; 181.597(1)(a) as imposing an obligation on a sex offender who was leaving the state to notify authorities within 10 days. Section 181.597(1)(a) was triggered by defendant's action in Oregon and had no extraterritorial effect. Defendant did not show that his right to free travel was burdened by the requirement that he notify the authorities of his change of residence.</SPAN></P>

The Harney County Circuit Court (Oregon) granted the demurrer on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.320 was unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court held that under U.S. Const. amend. X, &sect; 167.320 proscribed conduct which was constitutional. On appeal, the State argued that U.S. Const. amend. X did not speak to the issue of the authority of the State to regulate the conduct of its citizens. Instead, U.S. Const. amend. X spoke exclusively to the issue of the authority of the federal government in relation to the states and its citizens. The appellate court agreed with the State. At trial, defendant claimed that the right to kill animals such as rats, mice, and snakes was inalienable, but offered no explanation how the Oregon or federal Constitution protected that right. U.S. Const. amend. X did not protect against state infringement of an individual's right to kill mice, rats, rattlesnakes, gophers, or any other animals; it did not protect against state infringement of any right at all. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting the demurrer to the charge of first-degree animal abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Wasco County Circuit Court (Oregon) with distribution of a controlled substance. The court dismissed the charge with prejudice. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by dismissing the charge against defendant with prejudice. The court of appeals agreed. There was a delay of almost nine years between the date of the indictment and the date that proceedings were scheduled to resume in the trial court. The delay was due mainly to the appeal of a pre-trial motion to suppress. Defendant did not contend that the State's prosecution of the appeal or any action by the appellate courts was purposefully undertaken to &quot;hamper the defense.&quot; Nor was the total time expended so &quot;manifestly excessive&quot; as to compel dismissal without any consideration of the justifications for delay or the prejudice, if any, to defendant. Although the total time expended on the interlocutory appeal was much greater than average, defendant made no showing of unjustified delay. Consequently, notwithstanding the very substantial length of pretrial delay, because the delay was justified and because defendant neither was incarcerated pending trial nor suffered any actual prejudice to his ability to present his defense, he was not entitled to dismissal. Therefore, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

First, the State was required to prove that the item in question was prohibited by rule, statute, or order. Then, the State was required to show that its use endangered the safety or security of the institution or any person located therein.

The appellate court reversed the department's ruling on the signs that related to the excavation business and the casino as the department failed to provide the property owner of notice of any administrative rules in its notices. The court affirmed the ruling as to the sign that welcomed drivers, as while Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 377.735(1) exempted signs of a governmental unit, the property owner was not a governmental unit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and the law enforcement agency contended that Measure 3 violated Or. Const. art.

After a circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of the state officials, the county and the law enforcement agency sought review. In reversing, the court determined that Measure 3 was unconstitutional. The amendment to the Oregon Constitution made two or more substantive changes that were not closely related. Measure 3 added provisions to Or. Const. art. XV that prohibited the civil forfeiture of property unless the owner had been first convicted of a crime. Moreover, it directed how forfeited property should have been disposed of and distributed. The fact that the proposed provisions had a common objective did not mean that they were closely related.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, the State appealed pretrial orders of the Clackamas County Circuit Court, Oregon, suppressing evidence of a marijuana grow operation in the basement of a business operated by defendants. The trial court concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.695(1) and (4) required suppression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police in the State of Washington conducted a search of the residence of defendants' attorney, including a search of the attorney's personal organizer, which disclosed defendants' names and addresses. Defendants argued that the evidence was obtained through exploitation of the unlawful search of the attorney's Washington residence. Although the State conceded that the police acted unlawfully under Washington law, it argued that that illegality was irrelevant to any issue in this case because defendants lacked a protected privacy interest in the attorney's residence or in his organizer. The instant court concluded that neither Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.695(1) and (4) nor Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, compelled suppression. That information establishing the attorney's criminal involvement was obtained in violation of Washington law did not alter the fact that, at the time the officer read the organizer, he had &quot;probable cause&quot; for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.695(2) to believe that the attorney had committed a crime. The organizer was not protected by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.695(1).

She contended the school district was violating the Establishment Clause. The circuit court rejected plaintiff's challenges. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent of a public school child sought an injunction prohibiting the school district from continuing to allow the Boy Scouts to present membership information to students on public school premises. In response, the school superintendent conducted a preliminary investigation, after which he issued an order concluding there was no substantial basis to believe that the district was impermissibly involved with religious activity. The mother alleged her interests as a citizen-taxpayer gave her standing to seek judicial review of the order. The appellate court agreed that she had standing, but found no Establishment Clause violation. The court found that the Boy Scouts' conduct did not meet any of the prongs of the three-part Lemon test. The Boy Scout representatives who visited the school described the general kinds of activities involved in scouting but did not touch on anything having to do with religious beliefs or religious activities.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defendant failed to demonstrate that the deputy's subsequent request for consent extended the stop so as to give rise to a constitutional violation. The stop was validly ongoing at the time consent was requested. There was no evidence that, at the time the deputy requested consent, the officer had completed and issued the traffic citation or documentation associated with the tow and impoundment. Rather, all reasonable record inferences were to the contrary.

The contractor counterclaimed based on the amount unpaid on the contract and brought a third-party claim against defendant property owner and defendant bank. The Circuit Court, Marion County, Oregon, granted the contractor summary judgment. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the contractor argued that the trial court erred in denying it attorney fees as it was not a plaintiff or cross-complainant within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 87.057. The appellate court determined that even if &sect; 87.057 did apply, the contractor proved compliance with its requirements, and the trial court erred in denying the contractor's motion to amend its pleading to conform to that evidence. Further, the corporation failed to identify how it would be prejudiced if the amendment were allowed. Because the contractor failed to provide the bank with notice of its right to a lien, the contractor was not entitled to priority for materials charges and for labor charges that were lumped together with materials charges. As there was no evidence that the contractor would be unable to satisfy its entire judgment from the foreclosed property, the record supported the trial court's determination that the property owner had not been unjustly enriched. The appellate court interpreted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 87.060(3) to mean the trial court's authority to resolve pleaded issues was limited to issues subsumed within the lien claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment denying the contractor attorney fees was reversed and remanded; the portion of the judgment denying the corporation's request for a jury trial on its breach of contract claim was reversed and remanded.

Had he not been designated a dangerous offender, petitioner's maximum indeterminate sentence for the crime of first-degree manslaughter would have been 20 years. Petitioner's principal claims in the current petition was that the imposition of a dangerous offender sentence for his crime violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father, who had been serving a sentence of more than three years' imprisonment on a criminal conviction, argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.322 was unconstitutional. The instant court did not reach the constitutional issues, but it construed the statute to require proof of a basis for terminating the father's parental rights in addition to the fact of his imprisonment. The instant court observed that the trial court did not believe that it was necessary to prove any of the statutory criteria for terminating the father's parental rights or to show that the father had done anything that placed the child at a risk of harm, that demonstrated an inability to be an adequate parent, or that constituted parental misconduct. Under its construction of the statute, the instant court gave effect to the procedures that the statute prescribed without permitting the termination of a parent's rights in the absence of evidence that would have otherwise supported that action, thereby protecting a parent's fundamental constitutional right while preserving the statutory scheme that the legislature created. The trial court did not consider the issues essential to an adoption under &sect; 109.322.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dissolution case, the Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon, awarded the custody of two children to respondent, the husband. The older child was the biological daughter of appellant, the wife, and the stepchild of the husband. The younger child was the biological daughter of the husband and the wife. The circuit court also awarded the husband $ 10,000 for attorney fees. The wife appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and the wife were married in September 1992. At that time, the wife already had a 22-month-old daughter, C, from an earlier relationship. The husband and the wife were more or less equally involved in nurturing and caring for C. The husband was the only father figure C knew. C used the husband's last name and learned that he was not her biological father only after the husband and the wife separated. Another daughter, E, was born to the parties in July 1995. After E's birth, the wife took a job working nights and weekends, and the husband became jealous. Ultimately, the couple divorced. The husband was given custody of the children. The court of appeals held that the custody of C was determined under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.119(2)(b) (1997). Although the statute was not unconstitutional, the trial court applied it unconstitutionally, because the trial court used the &quot;best interest&quot; standard instead of the &quot;parental preference&quot; standard. Applying the parental preference standard, the wife was to have sole custody of C. In turn, under the &quot;best interest&quot; standard for determining custody disputes between two legal parents, the wife was also to have sole custody of E.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award of custody was reversed and remanded; the attorney fee award was vacated and remanded for reconsideration; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, asserting that under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and U.S. Const. amend. IV, the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant's father's car, in which defendant was a passenger. The father told the officer that marijuana might be in the car. The officer then confronted defendant, telling defendant that a drug dog might be brought in, and defendant pulled several baggies containing marijuana from his pocket. More drugs were then found in defendant's backpacks in the car. Defendant argued that the evidence was seized as the result of the unlawful detention of the vehicle, and his father's person, and it therefore was subject to suppression. The State countered that, because defendant did not assert a violation of his own personal rights, he could not bring a constitutional claim. The appellate court agreed with the State. Any incidental detention of defendant as a passenger during the time of a lawful stop of the driver did not implicate defendant's Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 rights. Further, defendant produced the drugs voluntarily. Although the police traded on a prior illegality (the detention of the father), in the absence of a constitutional violation of defendant's personal rights, that occurred before his voluntary production of the drugs, there was no ground for suppression.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the trial court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed speeding in Oregon by a police officer. Because defendant was traveling on a bridge in a construction zone, the officer did not activate his overhead lights for safety reasons until defendant had crossed the bridge and crossed into Washington. Defendant was cited for violating the basic speed rule. He filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that the officer did not stop him or cite him until after defendant was in Washington. The trial court found that the stop was authorized, but the court disagreed and reversed on appeal. The court held that the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss. After reviewing the legislative history, the court held that &sect; 810.410(2) provided that, at most, an officer was authorized to issue traffic violation citations in a state outside of Oregon, but only if that action was authorized by the other state. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.89.010, an officer from another state was only entitled to pursue a person into Washington if that person was believed to have committed a felony or was driving recklessly. This was not the case here, and thus the officer had no authority to stop defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged a decision of the Circuit Court, Josephine County (Oregon), which awarded respondent grandmother the right to visit the parents' child despite their objection. The parents argued that the trial court's decision violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.121 (repealed 2001), and if not, that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child originally spent a fair amount of time with the grandmother. When the parents became dissatisfied with the grandmother's conduct toward the child, which included giving her snacks and presents, the parents began to limit visitation. The grandmother filed this action to compel visitation. The trial court ruled in favor of the grandmother, but the court reversed on appeal. The court first found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.121 (repealed 2001) and the purportedly retroactive replacement of it with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.119 (2001) did not affect the action because the petition was filed under the 1997 edition of the statute, and the retroactivity section applied only to petitions filed under the 1999 edition of the statute. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it required the trial court's application of the best interest test only as that test was subject to and limited by the fundamental rights of the parents. In this case, the court found that the parents' concerns were not sufficiently weighted, and the grandmother did not overcome the presumption that the parents' decision to limit or ban visitation was in the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>
