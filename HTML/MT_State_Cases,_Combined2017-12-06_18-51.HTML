Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-206(2)(b) (2011), in violation of his right to equal protection, was properly denied because the unconstitutional provision &quot;with a person of the opposite sex&quot; could be severed; [2]-Both the statute as originally enacted and a 1995 amendment to the statute contained severability clauses; moreover, severing the clause would not affect the integrity or purpose of the statute, which would still protect victims of domestic violence; [3]-The court therefore rejected defendant's argument that although he was not in a same-sex relationship, the statute exposed him to greater punishment than a same-sex abuser would face if charged with simple assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">HOLDINGS: [1]-The district court erred in disqualifying defendant's expert from testifying at trial because given the significance of the taped interview with defendant's daughter following her general denial that he had sexually assaulted her, the expert's opinion about the interview technique was a significant exclusion; the defense expert was qualified by both education and experience to provide a critique of the prosecution expert's interviewing technique as it related to leading or suggestive questions and the effect that such questions could have on the results; [2]-The district court erred by mechanistically applying the Montana Rape Shield Law, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-511(2), to exclude defendant's proffered evidence; the court's statements excluding the proffered evidence showed no weighing of his rights to present a defense with the interests represented by the Rape Shield Law.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 2, with respect to another mine and its position had been litigated and rejected; [2]-The court rejected the group's contention that it now advocated for a different interpretation of art. IX, &sect; 2 because the same legal issue was presented and, even if it were a new issue, it could have been raised in the earlier case; [3]-The group was similarly precluded from relitigating whether the Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act, Mont.

Alabama, prohibiting mandatory life sentences for juveniles, was announced in 2012, and defendant was sentenced in 1985, defendant could not have raised a Miller claim on direct review or postconviction relief, and his claim sufficiently called into question the facial validity of his sentence to lift the statutory bar to a petition for habeas corpus relief; [2]-Miller's holding forbidding mandatory life without parole sentences did not apply because defendant's sentence was not mandatory under Montana's then sentencing scheme, which required individualized consideration, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-18-101, -201 (1978); [3]-The rule in Miller that a sentencer must follow a certain process before imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile was a new rule and was not substantive and therefore could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect; 10 by allowing a workers' compensation insurer and its agents to have ex parte communications with the claimant's medical providers without the claimant's knowledge and opportunity to participate; [2]-The WCC also did not err in concluding that a narrowly crafted release authorizing insurers to have ex parte contact with healthcare providers solely for administrative purposes would not violate a claimant's right of privacy.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-205(6), letting a certain percentage of landowners block zoning rules, unconstitutionally delegated legislative power, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mont. Const. art.

A hearing examiner determined that there had been violations, and the Commissioner of Political Practices affirmed and ordered the official to pay a fine and costs. The official appealed. The Thirteenth Judicial District, County of Yellowstone (Montana), affirmed the Commissioner, and the official appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A utility and another company that regularly appeared before the Public Service Commission sent the official checks for $ 1,000, which he deposited in his personal account, but which he used to produce brochures promoting a power &quot;brown-out&quot; and containing energy conservation tips. The court held that these transfers were substantial under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-2-102(3)(a) because their value was $ 50 or more, and that the brochures were not educational material as contemplated by &sect; 2-2-102(3) because they were also self-promotional. Additionally, the money transfers were not themselves educational material. The transfers therefore violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-2-104(1)(b)(i). He also violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-2-121(3)(a) by using state facilities and equipment for election purposes, including the use of his official email account on his campaign website. It was irrelevant that he used the email account while not at work.

However, even if the owner's interpretational arguments had merit, there was no factual record demonstrating exactly what the owner and his dog were doing at the time the citations were issued. The district court had observed that there was no evidence that the dog was at heel, securely restrained, or held. The owner introduced photographs at trial, all of which simply showed a loose dog. There was no testimony about whether the dog did or did not stay. The court declined to issue an advisory opinion as to whether, if the dog was under voice control, the ordinance would have been void as vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of the Twentieth Judicial District, Lake County, Montana, denied appellant parents' motion to disqualify counsel in a personal injury matter. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents argued that the district court erroneously interjected itself into their private affairs thereby hindering their ability to make decisions concerning their child's best interests. The supreme court found that there was no need to show that a conflict existed between the parents and child's interests or that the parents were unfit, because the parents voluntarily relinquished their control of the litigation to the guardian ad litem (GAL) and conservator. The parents never petitioned the district court for removal of the GAL and conservator. The parents explicitly nominated a conservator and the district court's order did not place any limitations on the conservator's authority to act in such capacity. As requested by the parents, the conservator was to oversee the child's legal claims arising from the accident. This necessarily included overseeing the litigation itself, including making decisions as to which counsel should represent the child. Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-61-403 and 72-5-427 were not unconstitutional where the parents failed to comply with the statutes.&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 37-61-403 did not conflict with Mont. R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(a)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 18th Judicial District Court, Gallatin County (Montana), entered a judgment that denied defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of using obscene, lewd, and profane language in violation of the Privacy in Communications statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-213. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of that statute on overbreadth, vagueness, and free speech grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant made a phone call to a public employee, a woman who worked in a victim's assistance agency, at her place of work to request help in filing an order of protection. However, he became incredibly frustrated when she refused to help and he uttered the words &quot;fucking cunt&quot; in exasperation. Thereafter, a citation was issued against him that stated that he &quot;called victim on telephone and used obscene, lewd, and profane language, offending the victim&quot; in violation of the Privacy in Communications statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-213(1)(a). The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the charge. He then challenged that statute on multiple constitutional grounds. The state supreme court found that: (1) the trial court erred in finding the speech constituted unprotected &quot;fighting words&quot; since the speech did not involve a face-to-face communication likely to provoke an immediate threat; (2) the prima facie provision of that statute had to be stricken as unconstitutionally overbroad since the language at issue could be applied to words not uttered with an intent to violate that statute; (3) further proceedings were required; and (4) that statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court reversed the trial court's conclusion that defendant's speech constituted unprotected &quot;fighting words,&quot; struck a portion of the Privacy in Communications statute as unconstitutionally overbroad, and remanded the case to the trial court to allow him to withdraw his nolo contendere plea and proceed to trial on the charges brought against him under that statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant driver sought review of the decision of the District Court of the Fourteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Musselshell (Montana), which found in favor of appellee owner in an action stemming from an accident and granted the owner's motion to set aside the default judgment. The owner cross-appealed in the event that the motion was deemed denied by Mont. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was struck by a truck and she subsequently filed a complaint against the owner and driver seeking damages. The owner did not respond to the complain and a default was entered against it, along with an award of damages. The district court granted the owner's motion to set aside the default judgment, but the supreme court reversed and remanded, stating that unless a statute, rule, or constitutional provision expressly imposes jurisdictional limitations, the expiration of a time bar did not deprive a district court of the jurisdiction to further act in the matter before it. Therefore, the district court did not lose jurisdiction of this matter upon expiration of the 60-day time period under Mont. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). Further, the owner did not meet its burden of establishing extraordinary circumstances or blamelessness. Given the fact that the driver had always conceded the propriety of a full offset against the judgment of the amounts that she received from the insurance company, her conduct did not present the type of gross neglect or actual misconduct constituting an extraordinary circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the district court with directions for it to withdraw its December 27, 2011 order, reinstate the default judgment, and enter a corrected judgment reflecting the remaining amounts owed to the driver by the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While driving a school bus while he was intoxicated, defendant struck and injured a 15-year-old girl who was walking in a designated crosswalk.

The trial court sentenced him to prison for six years with 18 months suspended on each count, to run concurrently. Further, the court ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service and imposed 29 enumerated conditions of probation. The state supreme court found that: (1) defendant did not show that his sentence, imposed within statutory parameters, was illegal and, thus, did not qualify for Lenihan treatment that would allow for review even though no objection had been raised in the trial court; (2) he failed to challenge the reasonableness of the probation conditions imposed and, thus, could not have those conditions reviewed on appeal; (3) he did not comply with the appellate rules in claiming that his guilty pleas were illegally obtained; and (4) he could not claim that the Sentence Review Division process was unconstitutional since he had not yet applied for review of his sentence through that process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff religious colony brought suit against defendant, the Department of Labor and Industry, in the Ninth Judicial District Court, County of Glacier (Montana), alleging that amendments to the workers' compensation law that included colony members were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and violated Equal Protection. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled in favor of the colony, and the Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The colony was a religious group that practiced a communal lifestyle as part of its faith. Amendments to the definition of employer in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-117(1)(d) of the workers' compensation law included a religious organization receiving remuneration from nonmembers for agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project conducted by its members; this definition captured members of the colony who worked for others but gave their earnings to the community. Contrary to the district court, the court held that the amended definition regulated the colony's engagement in commercial activities in the same manner that the commercial activities of other employers were regulated. The requirement did not place the colony members in a discriminatory position compared to other religious groups who engaged in similar activity. The definition of &quot;employer&quot; did not lose its facial neutrality or shed its secular purpose by including the colony's commercial activities, as opposed to its religious practices, within the scope of the workers' compensation law. The colony had the option to self-insure under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-2101 to limit excessive entanglement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his incest conviction, but the supreme court affirmed. Although the pretext recordings of defendant's conversations with his daughter violated his rights under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 10 and 11, admission of the records at trial was harmless error. Even assuming, for the sake of discussion, that the jurors viewed the recordings as qualitatively more reliable evidence than the human testimony, the supreme court was required to consider whose credibility the recordings served to bolster, and that question was not as clear-cut as defendant would have the court believe. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting sexually oriented photographs that defendant took of his daughter because. The fact that defendant orchestrated and took sexually oriented photographs of his daughter had a tendency to make it more probable that he knowingly had sexual contact with her under Minn. R. Evid. 401 and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-507(1). The photographs were admissible for a valid &quot;other purpose&quot; theory under Mont. R. Evid. 404(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with crimes relating to their possession and distribution of greater quantities of marijuana than permitted under the Medical Marijuana Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-46-101 to 50-46-210 (2009). The District Court of the Twelfth Judicial District, in and for the County of Hill, Montana, dismissed. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court dismissed the charges on the basis that the State engaged in outrageous conduct within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. The Montana Supreme Court held that the undercover agent's actions fell far short of violating the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause. The agent obtained a fictitious Montana driver's license, and he used his false identity and pretended to have an ailment in order to obtain a prescription for medical marijuana and then to apply for a patient card. This type of law enforcement subterfuge did not constitute inherently immoral crimes but rather were crimes merely because they were prohibited by statute (malum prohibitum offenses). Because the agent's undercover involvement did not include malum in se acts, the defense of outrageous government conduct was not implicated under Ninth Circuit precedent. Further, the agent's malum prohibitum conduct did not injure defendants or affect their due process rights. The agent's conduct was necessary to infiltrate defendants' illegal marijuana enterprise and to maintain his credibility as a medical marijuana patient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal of the charges and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked in a small office that was heated by a propane stove. He began to experience headaches, nausea, fatigue and other health problems. Another employee previously had complained of carbon monoxide exposure from the propane stove. After denying a motion in limine, the district court admitted evidence that the employee's death prior to trial had been caused by alcohol abuse. In accordance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-413(2), the district court gave instructions that did not allow vicarious liability for intentional torts. The court held that a constitutional challenge to &sect; 39-71-413(2) was moot because the jury's verdict finding the three employees not liable foreclosed the statute's application. The issue of whether the district court should have given vicarious liability instructions was moot for the same reason. Although the case was not a wrongful death case, evidence concerning the cause of death was relevant under Mont. R. Evid. 401 and was not unfairly prejudicial under Mont. R. Evid. 403 because it supported the defense theory that alcohol abuse, rather than carbon monoxide exposure, was the cause of the deceased employee's health problems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the juvenile was delinquent for committing assault with a weapon. He was placed on probation until his eighteenth birthday. The State of Montana later filed a petition to revoke his probation on the ground that he violated the terms by possessing a handgun. The trial court revoked his probation and committed him to a youth correctional facility until his eighteenth birthday. The trial court extended his probation until his twenty-first birthday. On appeal, the court held that the language of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-1431(3) allowed the trial court to enter any dispositional order that originally could have been made, even if the order extended the juvenile's probation. Further, the imposition of the additional three-year term of probation did not violate the juvenile's constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. The trial court made it clear that it was extending the probationary period so that he could be more fully rehabilitated, consistent with the stated purpose of the Montana Youth Court Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-102. The juvenile's equal protection claim failed because he was not similarly situated with adults sentenced for the same crime.</SPAN></P>

The equitable considerations did not require the district court to award fees against the Attorney General under either Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Montana held that it was error to preclude defendant from raising automatism as an affirmative defense to the DUI charge. Defendant admitted that she met two of the three elements in the DUI statute,&nbsp;Mont.

The court agreed that she should be allowed to offer rebuttal evidence that she did not act voluntarily as contemplated and provided for by Montana law. In order to prove her automatism defense by reason of someone allegedly putting a date rape drug in her drink, she would have to prove by admissible evidence that she did not act voluntarily when she drove her vehicle. That evidence could include expert medical or pharmacological evidence, non-expert evidence, or a combination of both.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to felony arson. The District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, County of Yellowstone, Montana, sentenced him to a four-year suspended Department of Corrections commitment and required him to pay $ 1,600 in restitution. It ordered defendant to register as a violent offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (SVORA), Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-501 et seq., which included arson as a violent offense under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-502(10), (13), arguing that it violated his right to privacy under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. The court noted that defendant would be on probation for the first four years that he was required to register as a violent offender. Consequently, he had a diminished privacy interest during this time. Even after he finished serving his four-year probationary sentence, his privacy interests were not equal to those of an ordinary citizen. While society may generally recognize individuals' expectation of privacy in their whereabouts and residential address as reasonable, defendant was not the average individual--he was a convicted felon and violent offender. Whatever limited expectation of privacy he had as a violent offender in his whereabouts and residential information, the State's compelling interest in requiring that he register justified the enactment of the SVORA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for deliberate homicide, but the supreme court affirmed. Instruction 19 did not prejudice defendant's right to due process. The intoxication instruction merely advised the jury that intoxication did not excuse otherwise criminal conduct. The instruction did not mandate that the jury must find defendant guilty if they found that he was intoxicated. Defendant did not argue that he was incapable of forming the requisite mens rea for deliberate homicide because of his intoxication, or that his intoxicated state excused his actions. Instead, defendant essentially argued the victim negligently jerked the gun as he negligently handled it, causing it to go off. Instruction 19 did not prevent the jury from considering his intoxication in relation to that theory, and defendant failed to show how the instruction prejudiced his alleged right to present a defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was 17 years old, and in the company of two other juveniles on Halloween night in 1998. Seeking drugs and money, the perpetrators wore Halloween masks and broke into a home. While petitioner did not shoot and kill the homeowner, one of his companions did. Petitioner pleaded guilty to felony murder and aggravated burglary, for which he was sentenced to 30 years and 15 years, respectively. The court concluded that the district court acted within its statutory authority in sentencing petitioner to prison and that his sentences were not facially invalid. Petitioner's sentences did not offend the Constitution or his statutory rights. The statute in effect at the time petitioner committed his crimes and under which he was sentenced was Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-206(6) (2007). Because it was the controlling authority at the time, it was controlling in petitioner's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer appealed an order granting the employee's motion for class certification in a dispute over the discontinuation of a sick leave buy-back program, but the supreme court affirmed. The employees sufficiently alleged a threatened injury to a property right and therefore had standing to challenge the discontinuation of the program. Without a declaration regarding the employees' rights to cash out their accrued hours, the employees were left to guess whether they should continue to accumulate hours for retirement or use them as they accrue. Allowing a court to declare the rights and status of the parties at this time would avoid the unnecessary hardships and uncertainty that would follow if the employees were required to wait until retirement to raise a challenge. The injuries alleged by the class members were the result of a concerted scheme and a juridical link existed between the employers based on common ownership and identical employment terms.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that in light of the special verdict form and the jury's finding that a named party-defendant was not negligent, the customer could not demonstrate prejudice from the owner's reliance on the settled-party defense authorized by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-703(6)(a) (2007). Further, the customer was not entitled to a new trial on the ground that a juror discussed her position as manager of a gas station during jury deliberations and discussed the precautions taken at her gas station to prevent water from getting into the diesel fuel. The juror's statements were internal influences within the jury deliberations and her statement reflected precisely the type of personal knowledge and experience that was inadmissible under Mont. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff environmental organizations challenged a judgment by the District Court of the Sixteenth Judicial District (Powder River County, Montana) that defendant State's leases of mineral interests to defendant coal company without environmental review, as allowed by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-121(2), did not violate Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 or Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, or 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The environmental organizations sought declaratory rulings that the State Land Board wrongfully failed to conduct environmental studies required by the Montana Constitution prior to entering leases with the coal company. The court determined that because the leases did not remove any action by the coal company from any environmental review or regulation provided by Montana law, such environmental review was only deferred from the leasing stage to the permitting stage. The leases specifically required the coal company to comply with all applicable state and federal laws that applied, and specifically with Montana laws regarding mine siting and reclamation and requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement analysis. Because the leases themselves did not allow for any degradation of the environment, conferring only the exclusive right to apply for State permits, and because they specifically required full environmental review and full compliance with applicable State environmental laws, the act of issuing the leases without environmental studies under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-121(2) did not violate Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 or Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 or 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that it would review the State's appeal of paragraph 1(d) of the preliminary injunction order as it could review an order granting or dissolving, or refusing to grant or dissolve, an injunction or attachment, Mont.

However, individuals did not have a fundamental right to pursue a particular employment or employment free of state regulation. The providers remained free to pursue horticulture work generally and were not proscribed from practicing the art of horticulture for profit. The MMA did not implicate the fundamental right to employment. In pursuing health, an individual did not have a fundamental affirmative right of access to a particular drug. The right to privacy did not encompass the affirmative right of access to medical marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Montana Secretary of State challenged a decision from the District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee objectors and declared Legislative Referendum 123 (LR-123) to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A dispute arose over the role of Legislative Fiscal Analyst (LFA) under LR-123. The objectors contended that LR-123 impermissibly delegated legislative power to the LFA. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the objectors, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the challenge to LR-123 was justiciable and ripe. The issues were definite and concrete and not hypothetical. Moreover, it would have had a definite impact upon the State treasury and would have required the LFA to predict surpluses and calculations of refunds and payments in August 2013. Next, LR-123 was unconstitutional under Mont. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and Mont. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because the authority to determine when State funds should be paid out was not delegated to the Legislative Finance Committee, but to its individual agent, who served at the pleasure of the Committee under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 5-12-205(2). Under Mont. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, it was the responsibility of the Montana Governor to see that the laws passed by the Montana Legislature were properly executed. LR-123 was unconstitutional on its face and could not appear on the ballot in November 2012.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">I-166 was a ballot initiative that would establish the policy of the State of Montana to be that corporations were not entitled to constitutional rights and were not persons; it would charge elected officials to prohibit corporate political campaign spending and to limit political spending in elections. The Secretary of State received the proposed initiative and submitted it to Legislative Services and then to the Attorney General for review. The Attorney General revised the proponents' statement of purpose but otherwise found that the proposal met the required legal sufficiency review. The proponents could then begin gathering signatures, as provided in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-27-202. The court held that the Attorney General had no power to review the substantive legality of I-166. The petition did not allege nor did the court find that the petition was legally insufficient as to the requirements for submission of a proposed ballot issue under Mont.

Defendant consented to a search after indicating he had a medical marijuana card. Among the items found in the vehicle were 20 small baggies of marijuana and two one-gram bottles of hashish. Defendant was charged with, among other things, criminal possession of dangerous drugs under &sect; 45-9-102 for possession of the hashish, and his motion to dismiss on the basis that his medical marijuana card entitled him to possess the hashish was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Only limited exceptions were available under the Montana Marijuana Act (MMA), and the MMA adopted the definition of marijuana in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 50-32-101(17), which did not include hashish. A definition of usable marijuana under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 50-46-102(10) referred to a mixture or preparation of marijuana, but that had to be read in conjunction with the distinction of hashish in Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that the district court did not err when it prohibited defendant from testifying that the January altercation was caused by defendant walking in on the victim purposely cutting herself. Additionally, even if counsel had not been diligent in presenting defendant's justifiable-use-of-force defense, the testimony defendant sought to introduce regarding the victim cutting herself was improper character evidence of the victim and would not have been admissible under the rules of evidence in any event. Counsel could not be considered ineffective for failing to make a meritless objection. Defendant failed to meet his burden to show that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. Because defendant made an insufficient showing on this first prong of the Strickland test, the supreme court did not address the second prong.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted summary judgment to the voters, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-2-101, the justices of the Montana Supreme Court were elected on a statewide basis. LR-119 would have changed the law so that each justice was elected from one of seven districts of approximately equal population, and the voters of each district could vote for only one justice. The court held that the justices were not required to recuse themselves from hearing the case under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1-803 or Mont. Code Jud. Conduct 2.12 because any benefit to them from their decision was remote and speculative. LR-119 was unconstitutional on its face because it attempted, through statutory measures, to change the constitutionally-established qualifications for Supreme Court justice by adding a new residency requirement. Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9 provided for qualifications of the justices, and it required only that they be residents of the state, not any particular district. The Constitution prescribed the specific methods for making amendments, Mont. Const. art. XIV, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 8, 9, and statutory amendments were not permitted. Mont. Const. art.

The district court granted the property owner's for change of venue to Pondera County, where the property owner resided. On the basis of controlling precedent, the supreme court reversed. Pondera County would have been a proper place for trial under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-2-122(1). Nonetheless, because Powder River was incorporated in a state other than Montana, &sect; 25-2-122(2) also specified a proper place for trial. Accordingly, the sorter's decision to file her complaint in Yellowstone County was legally correct under &sect; 25-2-122(2)(b). The statute permitting the sorter to file her action in the county of her residence did not deprive the property owner of the equal protection of the laws under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner filed suit in the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, In and For the County of Missoula, Montana, against defendants city, board of adjustment, and two neighbors. The district court awarded attorney fees and costs to the neighbors, finding the action frivolous. The district court also concluded that the board did not abuse its discretion in revoking a building permit issued to the landowner. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner, who owned 24 rental properties, wanted to build a large structure to house spare furniture, household items, and vehicles; however, the property was located in a single-family residential area. The landowner was advised by letter from the city that any building on the property was required by city ordinance to be an accessory use to an existing structure on the property. None of the property he intended to store in the building had any demonstrable association with the existing single-family dwelling on the property. Under the zoning ordinance, the storage building was therefore not an accessory to the existing single-family residence. The determination that the structure failed to comply with the zoning ordinance was supported by the facts, was not clearly unreasonable, and was not an abuse of discretion. The court upheld the award of attorney's fees to the two neighbors who had objected to the structure and agreed with the district court that the neighbors were not entitled to attorney's fees for seeking fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen was arrested in connection with the death of his niece. The charges were later dropped after it was determined that a school bus had run over the child. The citizen sued, alleging negligent investigation of the cause of death and negligent arrest, but the trial court granted the county and State summary judgment. The court affirmed on appeal. The citizen claimed that the medical examiner negligently reported the death of the child as a homicide. The State claimed immunity under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-3-401, 46-4-104 (2009). There would be no reason for a medical examiner to perform an autopsy at police request but not report the findings. The issuance of the report was an integral component of the autopsy procedure and was covered by immunity. Thus, the State was immune under the statutes from the citizen's negligence claim. Because the citizen was lawfully restrained under a determination of probable cause, for purposes of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-6-201, his false imprisonment claim failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1999, defendant pleaded guilty to felony sexual assault and was sentenced to two concurrent 20-year terms with ten years suspended. Two days before his scheduled release, the State filed a motion in the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, In and For the County of Cascade (Montana), seeking to revoke the suspended portion of the sentence. The district court granted the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the district court did not violate former Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-203(2) (1999) when it revoked the suspended sentence pursuant to a motion that was filed before the period of suspension had begun. The rule of State v. Stiffarm, finding such motions contrary to the statute, applied prospectively to cases on collateral review. Defendant was an extremely dangerous sex offender who had molested more than 200 children; the district court found he had questionable prospects for rehabilitation. Despite defendant's substantial difficulties in finding living arrangements that were more than 1500 feet from areas where children lived and played, and in finding treatment options, the conditions were reasonably designed to protect society and serve defendant's rehabilitation by limiting his opportunity to reoffend.

Petitioner had also been convicted of three separate charges of intimidation. Petitioner sought the issuance of a writ of error coram vobis or an alternate remedial writ. Petitioner challenged the sheriff's sale of his ranch. He also claimed that the dissolution of his marriage was void. He further maintained that he was denied the opportunity to retain the attorney of his choice. The court found that the writ petitioner sought was abolished by Mont. R. Civ. P. 60(e). Moreover, he failed to identify any alternative writ that might be viable under the facts. The petition did not establish any error on the part of the trial courts that he challenged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporations sued defendants, the Montana Attorney General and Commissioner of Political Practices, for a declaration that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-35-227(1) violated their freedom of speech by prohibiting political expenditures by corporations. The District Court of the First Judicial District, County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, enjoined enforcement of the statute and denied attorney fees. The State appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs wanted to spend corporate funds to independently support or oppose political candidates, and believed that doing so would be prohibited by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-35-227(1). The district court declared the statute unconstitutional based on the United States Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United that the government could not prohibit independent corporate expenditures on political speech. The Supreme Court of Montana reversed the district court's decision due to a material factual distinction between the present case and Citizens United, namely the extent of the regulatory burden imposed by the challenged law. Montana had a compelling interest in protecting and preserving its system of elected judges, and the statute was narrowly tailored to meet its purpose of protecting the due process rights of litigants in Montana courts to a fair and independent judiciary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Jefferson County deputy approached defendant's vehicle, which was parked in Madison County, Montana, and saw him lying motionless and unresponsive therein. She determined that defendant was intoxicated. When a second deputy arrived, they arrested defendant for DUI. He moved to dismiss/suppress, arguing that his arrest was illegal because the deputies lacked authority in Madison County. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the arrest was legal because the deputies were acting as private citizens. On review, the court held that the private person arrest statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-6-502, applied only to arrests by actual private persons (i.e., non-peace officers) and did not extend to county deputies acting outside of their jurisdiction. However, the circumstances existing when the deputies initially encountered and approached defendant's vehicle gave them sufficient grounds to conduct a welfare check. The deputies' ensuing observations would have justified a private person in making an arrest. Thus, it was lawful for the deputies, acting as out-of-jurisdiction peace officers, to make the arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, Montana, entered summary judgment in favor of appellee insurer on appellant insureds' suit seeking uninsured motorist benefits under the insured's second policy. The insureds appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that it had no evidence as to why the insurer paid the insured an additional $25,000 in December 2006 purportedly under Policy #59. Without such evidence, the supreme court could not conclude that the payment was in any way an admission that the insured's 2001 release and settlement was not full and final. Payment of this second $25,000 achieved the same outcome as stacking the insured's policies would have achieved. The district court correctly determined on the merits that the insured's claim against the insurer was barred. Were the supreme court to re-open the insured's claim for additional benefits, its pronouncements in an earlier case would be rendered completely meaningless. The insureds were not proper representatives of a class consisting of other insurer's policyholders who may have valid anti-stacking claims. They could not establish standing because neither had a personal case or controversy against the insurer with respect to medical payment issues. As neither insured had standing to represent the defined class under Mont. R. Civ. P. 23(a), the district court did not err in denying class certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of assault with a weapon and sentenced to five years in prison. Shortly thereafter, he was transferred to a prerelease center. The Board of Pardons and Parole granted him parole conditioned, inter alia, upon obtaining employment. He obtained a 10-day furlough to seek employment and was warned that absconding from furlough or failure to return on time would be considered felony escape. Nevertheless, he did not return from it and had to be arrested about a month after he was supposed to have returned. He was charged with felony escape in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-7-306 (2007). His motions to dismiss that charge were denied and he eventually pled guilty to the charge and resulting 10-year sentence with five years suspended. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the furlough was not a parole, but was &quot;official detention&quot; under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-7-306(2) (2007) that he walked away from that violated the felony escape statute. It also found that: (1) he waived a constitutional vagueness challenge to the statute by not raising the issue in the trial court and (2) the sentence sought and obtained did not result from prosecutorial vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, Montana, reversed appellant Missoula City-County Health Board's (Board) determination that appellee landowners had violated the Missoula City-County Health Code (Health Code) by placing two buildings in the floodplain without a permit and by installing an incinerating toilet. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court found that the district court's plain reading of the 2007 Health Code considered only a partial reading of the definition of &quot;increased use.&quot; The definition of &quot;increased use&quot; plainly stated that the concept included but was not limited to the enlargement of a residence. The district court's order failed entirely to address whether the landowner's change in use of the structure would potentially increase the effluent flow from the structure. The district court had to determine whether the landowner's actions constituted an &quot;increased use&quot; under either part of the definition that potentially would increase effluent flow to her septic system. The wastewater treatment system did not have to dispose of the effluent underground in order to fall within the Health Code's prohibition. The landowner made no plausible claim of having the incinerating toilet grandfathered under the 1983 permit. The Board correctly affirmed the Amended Notice of Violation even though the landowner apparently had unplugged the toilet by the August 20, 2009, hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioners created an interim zoning district and proposed the creation of four permanent zoning districts. None of the proposed zoning districts received sufficient protest votes to block the proposal. The advocacy group challenged the constitutionality of the public comment provision of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-205(6). The parties agreed to maintain the status quo and obtained an agreed order from the district court to extend the interim zoning regulations. The commissioners took no action on the proposed resolution within 30 days after the protest vote. The district court concluded that it had erred in extending the interim zoning regulations and that the case was moot. The court held that pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 1-2-101, the parties could not extend by agreement the express time limits in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-206(2) for the interim zoning regulations. Moreover, the commissioners' failure to act within the 30-day period set out in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-205(6) was the equivalent of an affirmative rejection of the resolution. The court declined to invoke any exception to the mootness doctrine because the protests filed under &sect; 76-2-205(6) did not affect the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that the district court did not violate defendant's due process rights by instructing the jury as a matter of law that defendant's previous Washington conviction under Wash.

Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-502(9)(b) because defendant was required to register, as his conviction fit within the definition of &quot;sex offense&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030. The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting a continuance of trial that was requested by the State to permit an amendment of the information to add a reference to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-504(5), another statute defendant had violated, because: (1) the transiency statutes, upon which defendant was convicted, were added to Montana's Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act less than two years before the offense; (2) the trial was delayed 17; (3) the State's contentions did not change, only its legal theory; and (4) defendant had three weeks to prepare for trial following the entry of the order granting the continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee brought an action for wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendant, the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court determined that plaintiff, as a MDT employee, was precluded from filing a claim under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA), Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 2-18-1001 et seq. provided a remedy for his discharge, and was his exclusive remedy. The Supreme Court of Montana held that plaintiff failed to establish a violation of his right to equal protection under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, because he failed to show that MDT employees who were exempted from the WDEA and employees who were not exempted from the WDEA were similarly situated classes. The district court did not err by denying plaintiff's motions for leave to amend the complaint, because adding more claims was futile due to his failure to follow the MDT grievance procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Montana Workers' Compensation Court (WCC) determined that Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that Montana law limited a worker's eligibility for rehabilitation benefits, like the limitation for permanent partial disability benefits, to a set number of weeks, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-1006. A disabled worker could receive rehabilitation benefits for a maximum of 104 weeks. The elimination of rehabilitation benefits could not be understood as serving, or even relating to, the governmental interest in creating a wage-replacement system that bore a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. The trust accepted and paid appellee employee's medical and wage-loss benefits. Eliminating rehabilitation benefits did not relate to assisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. The employee's social security benefits would not provide him with resources to receive rehabilitation benefits that would return him to work after being disabled on the job. The categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-710 served no legitimate governmental interest, other than cost-containment, and therefore violated equal protection. A rational basis did not support the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits.</SPAN></P>

Consistent with the requirements of Mont.

Defendant also had the opportunity to confer with his attorney during the testimony. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated. Further, the trial court did not err in prohibiting defendant from conducting a forensic interview with, and calling as a witness at trial, the 4-year-old sibling of the victims. The 4-year-old did not have relevant testimony to offer, was incompetent to testify, and would be psychologically harmed if required to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to reduce charge to misdemeanor. The supreme court adhered to the principle that, in Montana, the State could not use a constitutionally inform conviction to support an enhanced punishment. To prevail on his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not raising compulsion as a defense to the 1996 DUI charge, defendant had to establish that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and a reasonable probability existed that the result of the trial would be different but for counsel's errors. The supreme court found that defendant did not show that his trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. There was evidence that defendant was the one who was drunk and challenging to fight. Defendant did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the trial court would have been different. It was still up to the jury to decide whether defendant &quot;reasonably&quot; believed that death or serious bodily harm would be inflicted upon him if he did not drive 20 miles down the a highway while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Concerns arose due to a child's special needs and the Department's previous interactions with the mother during termination proceedings involving her first two children. After her parental rights to this child were terminated, a treatment plan was approved to allow the father to parent the child on his own. The reunification plan required the father to obtain separate housing from the child's mother. When he failed to comply, the trial court did not err by terminating his parental rights. The father's constitutional rights to marry and to parent his child were not absolute, and had to give way when in direct conflict with the child's needs and rights under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-101(7). The district court's termination of his parental rights under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-609(1)(f)(i) was not a constitutional violation in light of the father's clear failure to comply with the majority of tasks assigned under his treatment plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, landowners and a company, sought review of an order from the District Court of the Twenty-First Judicial District, in and for the County of Ravalli (Montana), which awarded attorney fees to appellee, a river protective association, in an action for a declaration that a stream that ran adjacent to a river qualified as a natural, perennial-flowing stream under the Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was determined that a stream that ran adjacent to a river qualified as a natural, perennial-flowing stream. It was also determined that the stream was subject to stream access and public recreation as provided by Montana's stream access law. On remand, the trial court awarded attorney fees to the association in the amount of $ 319,405. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction to rule on the association's motion for attorney fees by operation of Mont. R. Civ. P. 59(g). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to the association under the private attorney general doctrine. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the association's fees related to the stream access law claim after the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) was joined on the case because it was clear that the association's participation in the case was essential to the vindication of rights in the case. However, the court could not determine the basis for the trial court's division of responsibility for the fee award among the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court remanded the case for further proceedings to clarify the parties against whom the fee judgment was imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father argued that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the stepfather was entitled to parenting rights and the sister was entitled to visitation rights with the child. The supreme court noted that the record contained sufficient evidence to support the district court's findings that the father engaged in conduct contrary to his parental relationship with the child. It was undisputed that the father missed many visitation opportunities. The father had paid only 25-30% of the child support he owed the child. The stepfather was not seeking exclusive custody of the child; therefore, the father's constitutional right to parent the child was not threatened with termination. Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-228, the father engaged in conduct that was contrary to his parental relationship with the child. The stepfather had established a parent-child relationship with the child, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-211(6). The district court did not err in determining that it was in the child's best interests to maintain her relationship with her stepfather and sister while residing with her father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, Montana, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee employer on the grounds that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-411, the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), barred appellant mother's survivorship and wrongful death claims against the employer arising from the work-related death of her son. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the district court erred in holding that her claims were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the WCA and denying her claim that Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-71-411 and 39-71-721(4), were unconstitutional. The supreme court noted that the son's injury was covered by the WCA, and he had some possibility of recovery. Although she was the son's parent, the mother did not satisfy the federal definition of dependency incorporated into the WCA which would have entitled her to wage loss payments. She received a lump sum payment of $3,000 paid to the decedent's surviving parent or parents, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-721(4). The Legislature logically directed wage loss benefits to those persons who depended upon them, and paid a small amount to those who did not. The WCA was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and satisfied due process and the quid pro quo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant driver sought review of an order entered by the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, in and for the County of Missoula (Montana), which denied her request to set aside appellee Department of Justice's (DOJ's) suspension of her driver's license pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-402.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was stopped for a traffic infraction and displayed signs of intoxication. At the request of the deputies, the driver performed field sobriety tests and provided a breath sample on a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test (PAST) device; however, after her arrest for DUI, the driver refused to provide a breath sample on an Intoxilyzer. The driver claimed that &sect; 61-8-402 was unconstitutional because the requirement of multiple alcohol breath tests violated, inter alia, her right to be free from unreasonable searches under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 10 and 11. On appeal, the court affirmed. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-409(2) provided for the use of pre-arrest PASTs to estimate an individual's alcohol concentration but stated that a PAST did not satisfy one's obligation to submit to a test under &sect; 61-8-402. The seizure of the driver's license was not unconstitutional because driving constituted a privilege, not a right, and involved the acceptance of responsibilities such as the implied consent provisions. The requests for multiple breath tests did not constitute warrantless searches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the District Court of the Twentieth Judicial District, in and for the County of Sanders (Montana), which, after she was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent, sexual intercourse without consent by accountability, and incest by accountability, ordered that she pay for all counseling, treatment, or therapy costs incurred by the victim and ordered her to have no contact with her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circumstances surrounding defendant's convictions and sentence were intertwined with the crimes of her husband, who was convicted of five counts of sexual misconduct against his daughter during the years 1992 to 2006. Defendant was sentenced to three concurrent prison terms of 25 years, with 10 years suspended. On appeal, the court found that the condition requiring defendant to pay for the victim's counseling, treatment, or therapy did not comply with the mandate in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-244(1) that a sentencing court specify the total amount of restitution that an offender was to pay. However, the condition prohibiting defendant from having contact with her husband was a prerequisite for her rehabilitation. She was so completely programmed by her husband that she participated in the ongoing sexual abuse of a child, even though she had no paraphilic interests or sadistic traits. Restricting her contact with him, therefore, would reduce the likelihood of her continuing to engage in criminal conduct and cause harm to others. The no-contact restriction was thus valid under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-202(1)(f). The no-contact restriction also passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the imposition of the restitution obligation for future medical expenses of the victim without reducing the obligation to a stated amount, and it remanded the case to the trial court to correct the illegal provision. The court affirmed the imposition of the no-contact restriction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court did not err in finding defendant guilty of failing to register as a sexual offender under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, Montana, revoked defendant's suspended sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the 2003 version of the revocation statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-203, applied. The supreme court found that it had to look to the statute in effect at the time defendant committed his crime to determine whether the court had to revoke his suspended sentence. Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-203(1) (1985), the district court was authorized in its discretion to revoke defendant's suspended sentence even though no conditions of probation or parole were set forth in the original judgment. The court revoked defendant's suspended sentence based on his guilty plea to the offense of felony bail jumping. Defendant could not claim, based on the basic proscription against criminal conduct and the admonitions in its original judgment, that he would not be expected to be law abiding upon his release from prison to serve his suspended sentence. The district court did not set any terms and conditions on his 1987 convictions. The new terms and conditions were added to defendant's suspended sentence for his 2008 conviction for bail jumping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court disagreed with the judge's contention that the JSC was attempting to regulate Indians running for tribal office. The State was seeking to enforce the qualifications for a state office which was sought and obtained by an individual Crow tribal member. The judge became a state official and took a constitutional oath of office to support, protect, and defend the Montana Constitution. The State was not impermissibly interfering with tribal sovereignty. The supreme court found that the position of Crow Tribal Chairman was not created by the Montana Constitution nor by the Legislature. The powers and duties of the tribal chairman were not directly or impliedly defined by the Montana Legislature. Tribal offices were creations of another sovereign and not considered public offices of the state. The office of the Crow chairmanship was created by the Crow Tribe and only tribal members were eligible to run for or vote for the position. The phrase &quot;elective public office&quot; in Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10 did not include the tribal office of Crow Tribal Chairman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer sought review of a decision from the Workers' Compensation Court (Montana), which refused to dismiss appellee claimant's petition as untimely under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-520(2)(c) (2005), determined that the claimant's employment was not casual employment under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-116(6) (2005), ordered the Uninsured Employers' Fund (UEF) to pay medical benefits to the claimant, and required the employer to indemnify UEF.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer hired the claimant to work on the construction of a residence and did not provide workers' compensation coverage. After the claimant sustained injuries while working on the house, he filed a claim for benefits with UEF, which was denied on the basis that he was a casual employee. A mediator recommended that the parties reach a settlement that included lost wages and medical costs. The claimant notified the mediator that he accepted the recommendation. UEF rejected the recommendation. The claimant filed his petition for administrative review more than 60 days after the mailing of the mediator's report. The court held that the doctrine of equitable tolling was applicable to extend the deadline in &sect; 39-71-520(2)(c) because the statute was ambiguous as to what constituted a final determination. The administrative decision unnecessarily addressed constitutional issues, but it reached the correct result. Substantial evidence, which included a business property characterization in federal tax filings, supported a finding that the employer did not intend to use the house as a residence. Thus, the casual employment exemption in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-401(2)(b) did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The consumer filed a cross-appeal, challenging the dismissal of the manufacturer's sales representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying the manufacturer's motion to amend its answer to assert a defense to apportion liability between it and the patient's oral surgeon because the manufacturer sought to introduce an entirely new defense shortly before trial and offered no persuasive reason justifying the delay. However, the trial court erred in offsetting social security disability benefits against the general damages award because it was impossible to determine whether the damages offset were included in the jury's verdict. The jury was instructed that its award could include damages for economic loss, reasonable compensation for mental anguish, and loss of  comfort, among other compensable losses, and the jury returned a verdict with a single amount for all damages, without any breakdown of damages allotted to each of the losses; without a breakdown of damages attributable to each loss, the trial court could not  properly determine  how much of the award was attributable to damages for which the plaintiff would be compensated by collateral sources, as would be a prerequisite for any offset under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-308.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the district court was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellant noncustodial parent sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The reviewing court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in adopting the final parenting plan. Factors considered, consistent with Mont.

Any error as to evidence of concerns by Child and Family Services Division about psychological abuse, arising from the noncustodial parent's numerous unsubstantiated allegations of child abuse, did not undermine the extensive support in the record for the order. The court vacated the district court's determination that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-225, requiring access to the children's records, violated their constitutional right to privacy; it was not necessary to reach the constitutionality of the statute because the therapy notes at issue could not conceivably have affected the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student was named valedictorian of her high school's graduating class and was instructed, consistent with district policy, to omit religious references from her valedictory address. When she refused to do so, she was not allowed to speak at the graduation ceremony. She filed suit, alleging that the school district violated her rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On review of summary judgment in favor of the school district, the court held that the school district violated the student's right to freedom of speech, entitling her to relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, because it impermissibly censored the content of her valedictory speech based on the viewpoint she expressed. It was unreasonable for the school district to conclude that cursory references to personal religious beliefs would be viewed by those in attendance as a religious endorsement by the school district. However, the school district did not violate the student's right to freedom of religion because it neither compelled her to violate the tenets of her religion nor denied her an important governmental benefit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Montana held that there was a particularized suspicion, as required by U.S. Const. amend. IV and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 11, to conduct an investigatory stop because an officer was present when the tires of defendant's truck screeched, he watched the truck rev continuously while crossing the intersection, and he observed the oversized tires without mud flaps, a potential violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-9-407; the driver engaged in that conduct despite being in full view of two officers on the street, and two patrol cars, both of which had their light bars activated. There was also a particularized suspicion to conduct field sobriety tests because defendant exhibited slow, slurred speech, had a delayed reaction time, and admitted that he had been drinking earlier in the day. Miranda warnings were not required during the roadside DUI investigation, which remained public, routine and temporary in nature. There was inadequate foundation under Mont. R. Evid. 702 to admit two deputies' expert opinion that defendant's ability to drive was impaired by marijuana, but the error in admitting the testimony was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his sentence violated the Montana Constitution's bar against double jeopardy. The supreme court noted that the two sentence &quot;enhancements&quot; of which defendant complained were not predicated on the same act. While the enhanced charge of felony DUI and the enhanced PFO sentence were both based on defendant's recidivism, they were not based on the same prior conviction. Therefore the double jeopardy rule from a prior case did not apply. An enhanced sentence under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-502 did not supplement, but supplanted the sentence for the underlying felony. The district court sentenced defendant as a PFO pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-502. Such punishment was the proper means of dealing with repeat offenders. The district court properly sentenced defendant solely under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-502.

The district court denied a motion to suppress a warrantless recording of a cell phone conversation between defendant and an informant, denied a challenge for cause to a prospective juror who indicated that he would be partial to testimony by police officers, and denied a jury instruction on accomplice testimony. The court held that the denial of the challenge for cause under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-115(2)(j) was reversible error because the juror's statements raised serious doubts about his ability to be fair and impartial, which implicated the right to an impartial jury under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 24. In the event of a new trial, defendant was entitled to suppress the recorded conversation because defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 10, 11; the court overruled prior decisions to the contrary. Defendant was entitled to an accomplice instruction under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1-303(4) because the jury reasonably could have found that the informant was an accomplice as defined in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-302(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a mistrial and defendant's refusal to plead guilty to assault on a minor, defendant was charged with felony assault with a weapon, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-213(1)(a), based on an allegation that he caused bodily injury to his son with a weapon by hitting him multiple times with a belt. A jury of the District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, found him guilty, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Montana held that there was an appearance of vindictive prosecution when defendant was charged with felony assault with a weapon. Because no new factual information was uncovered after the first trial that would have justified a decision to increase the charges, the threat of a four-fold increase in punishment had the appearance of prosecutorial vindictiveness and raised the reasonable likelihood that the State was simply utilizing the increased charges in an effort to deter defendant from exercising his right to a second jury trial. The court also held that the admission of photographic evidence of another child's injuries, as well as other evidence of the mother's prior bad acts, constituted an abuse of discretion. Finally, the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in conducting an in camera review of the investigative file of the Child and Family Services Division and in refusing to disclose the contents of the entire file to defendant, despite defendant's argument about the absence of notes from a social worker's phone conversation with him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the conviction for assault with a weapon and remanded for a new trial on the charge of assault on a minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitioners invoked the court's original jurisdiction to challenge the Attorney General's legal sufficiency determination and ballot statements. The court was asked whether the Attorney General's ballot and fiscal statements complied with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-27-312. The ballot concerned the annual interest and fees charged by deferred deposit (payday) lenders. The court determine that adding the term &quot;consumer loan licensees&quot; to the statements of purpose and implication, and making other minor additions and stylistic changes, would be the most effective remedy for the omission of which the association member complained. Also, the court declined the petitioners' request to overrule the Attorney General's legal sufficiency determination for I-164 or to tamper with the text of the initiative itself. The Attorney General acted within his considerable discretion in drafting the ballot statements and fiscal statement for I-164. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-27-312 did not grant the petitioners the right to the ballot statements of their choosing. The Attorney General's fiscal statement accurately provided that I-164 would reduce the license and examination fee revenue paid to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On a petition for grandparent visitation pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-9-102, the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Yellowstone, Montana, entered an order adopting a stipulation, under which appellee grandmother was allowed contact with her grandchildren. The district court denied appellant mother's subsequent motion to terminate the contact, and the mother sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the district court erred by applying the statute governing amendments to parenting plans adopted in the context of marriage dissolutions. Applying Fourteenth Amendment principles, the court held that a parent could obtain modification or termination of a previously issued order for grandparent contact where it was in the best interests of the child or where the contact previously ordered by the court was unduly interfering with the parent's primary role in the child's upbringing, including the inculcation of moral standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good citizenship. The court set forth applicable standards, including that the parent had the burden of proof on the termination motion, under a preponderance standard, and that it was not necessary to show that the child suffered demonstrable harm. In the current case, the existing order for grandparent contact was entered based on a stipulation, thus bypassing the procedure under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-9-102. The court therefore remanded the case for a fitness determination, as well as to allow the parent to present evidence on the motion to terminate contact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the district court's order and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, Montana, granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, employer and supervisors, on appellant employees' claims of negligence, intentional battery, and negligence infliction of emotional distress. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court held that the employees' claims were barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, Mont. Code Ann. 39-71-413. The employees argued that they had presented evidence demonstrating that the employer intentionally injured them, allowing them to avoid the exclusivity provision. The supreme court found that while the employees averred that the employer intentionally and deliberately exposed one employee to dangerous conditions in the office, and did not respond to his complaints that he was becoming ill, these allegations did not establish that the employer had actual knowledge that requiring the employee to work in his office would result in certain injury. The fact that the subsequent employee had previously raised the same complaints, and then lost consciousness in the office, did raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employer had actual knowledge that requiring the second employee to work in the same office, without investigating or addressing the alleged contamination, was certain to cause him injury. The employees failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-413 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grant of summary judgment was affirmed with respect to one employee and to the rejection of the employees' constitutional challenges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that summary judgment finding that the rivers were owned by the State because they were navigable when Montana became a state in 1889 was proper. The evidence presented by the State sufficiently demonstrated navigability under the navigability for title test. Despite the presence of portages along two of the rivers, the historical evidence established that they provided a channel for commerce at the time of statehood or were susceptible of such use. While the historical usage of the third river was not as well-established, the evidence of a log float on its middle portion in the 19th century, combined with its present-day usage, demonstrated that the river was susceptible of providing a channel for commerce at the time of statehood. The district court erred, however, in ruling that the riverbeds at issue were school trust lands, and the court held that such lands were public trust lands under Mont. Const. art. X, &sect; 11(1). The district court did not err in using the shared net benefits methodology to establish damages because it was proper to consider the productive value of the land in order to arrive at a figure for the fair market value of the use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant juvenile challenged an order of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, in and for the County of Cascade, Montana, that denied his motion to dismiss charges of criminal trespass, arguing that the notice provided to him precluding him from entering certain property was defective and that, without notice, he could not commit trespass and there was thus no probable cause to charge him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city police department served the juvenile with notice that he was not allowed on certain property, and the notice included an acknowledgement that the juvenile could be arrested if he returned to the property. Subsequently, the State filed a youth court petition charging the juvenile with seven misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-203. The juvenile moved to dismiss, arguing that the charges were not supported by probable cause. After his motion was denied, he pled true to the charges. On review of the youth court's denial of the motion to dismiss, the court held that, where the juvenile signed and read the notice that the police officer delivered to his home, where the affidavit in support of the charging instrument explained the circumstances of each alleged trespass and indicated that the officer had informed the juvenile that he was not permitted to enter the property, and where the juvenile admitted that he committed trespass even after having been barred from the property, the youth court correctly denied the motion to dismiss and properly concluded that probable cause was established.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff former employee sued defendant former employer for wrongful discharge. Following a trial, the jury delivered a verdict for the employer. The District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Yellowstone, Montana, held a hearing and granted the employer's motion for attorney fees and costs. The employee appealed this ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer offered to submit the employee's wrongful discharge claim to binding arbitration. The letter extending this offer indicated that if arbitration was refused, the employer would seek attorney fees in accordance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-915 in the event it prevailed at trial. Arbitration did not occur, and the jury rendered a verdict for the employer. The district court awarded the employer $ 33,919.94 in fees and costs. On appeal, the employee argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-915 was unconstitutional. Because the employee never raised the constitutional issue before the district court, the Supreme Court of Montana declined appellate review. The district court's failure to making a finding in its written order that the employee explicitly declined arbitration did not justify reversal of the fee award. After receiving notice of the employee's counsel's motion to withdraw, Mont. Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 10 did not require the employer to give the employee notice of its intent to pursue post-trial proceedings.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The employee specifically alleged that the employer's conduct fit within the exception to workers' compensation exclusivity at Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-413. The supreme court found that, at a minimum, the district court should have afforded the employee the opportunity to develop the record through discovery to attempt to show intentional and deliberate action on the part of the employer. Requiring the employee to have served the Attorney General before serving the opposing party or developing his case through discovery did not further the purpose of Mont. R. Civ. P. 24(d). Nothing prevented the Attorney General from participating in the litigation.

He was sentenced as a persistent felony offender under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-501. His challenge to the sentence enhancement was rejected on direct appeal because it was raised for the first time on appeal. He later filed a petition for postconviction relief challenging the sentence enhancement, which was found to be untimely, and a petition for habeas corpus that was held to be barred by res judicata. In his current habeas petition, he argued that new case law should be applied retroactively and on collateral review.

Code Ann. &sect; 87-2-202(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed on their right of privacy by requiring them to disclose the last four digits of their social security numbers in submitting license applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the statute did not affect a fundamental privacy right because, unlike other personal information, social security numbers originated with the government. Because the statute did not implicate a fundamental right, a rational basis review--rather than strict scrutiny--applied, and the statute survived rational basis review because it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The state's interest in collecting the last four digits of social security numbers from applicants for conservation licenses included continued receipt of federal funding for child support enforcement programs and funding for the state's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, access to federal tools for locating parents to establish paternity and enforce child support obligations, and support for the welfare of children in Montana. Those were legitimate state interests, and the challenged requirement of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-2-202(1) rationally related to those interests because the state would lose access to federal funding and federal tools for locating parents owing child support if it failed to comply with the requirements of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666(a)(13).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a ruling of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, Montana, denying his motion to dismiss a charge of criminal endangerment and rejecting his as-applied vagueness challenge to Montana's criminal endangerment statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-207.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After having consumed a few alcoholic beverages, defendant crashed his pickup into the back of a woman's minivan, propelling the minivan into another vehicle. Two young children were passengers in the minivan. Although the woman in the minivan and the driver of the third vehicle complained of neck pain after the collision, the children were unharmed. Defendant argued that he was never given notice or put on notice of what conduct was prohibited and that &sect; 45-2-207 did not contain sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court concluded that defendant failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that &sect; 45-2-207 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. To the degree that defendant asserted that due process required him to have actual notice of the prohibition of &sect; 45-5-207, before he could be prosecuted (in the sense that he had to be aware of the existence of the statute), he was mistaken. Defendant's argument - that the arresting officers arbitrarily charged him with criminal endangerment because he refused to cooperate - was sheer conjecture and also unlikely given that his conduct plainly fell within the proscription of the criminal endangerment charge.</SPAN></P>

When gang members began congregating in the law library, this constituted a threat to the safety and security of staff and inmates, and the prison administration was within constitutional parameters in temporarily reducing inmate access. Further, because the inmates failed to show any actual injury or prejudice resulting from lack of an adequate law library or legal assistance, neither inmate articulated any specific, non-frivolous legal claim that the DOC frustrated or impeded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A patient was terminally ill with lymphocytic leukemia. Plaintiffs brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the application of Montana homicide statutes to physicians who provide aid in dying to mentally competent, terminally ill patients.

The district court further held that the patient's right to die with dignity under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 4, 10 included protection of the patient's physician from prosecution under the State's homicide statutes. The Supreme Court of Montana held that it was not necessary for the district court to reach the constitutional issue. Deciding the case on statutory grounds, the Supreme Court of Montana held that under Mont.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-5-101 et seq., violated his constitutional right to equal protection by not providing a procedure and standards to evaluate the competency of youths. The supreme court noted that the consequences for defendant alleged to be a youth in need of intervention for negligent arson were significantly different than an adult charged with the same underlying offense of negligent arson. Youths alleging incompetency based on immaturity were not similarly situated to adult criminal defendants alleging mental disease or defect. Equal protection was not implicated. Substantial evidence supported the youth court's findings that defendant could consult with his attorney and understand the proceedings against him. Defendant's actions demonstrated that he knew setting the fire was wrong. The youth court had substantial evidence to conclude that defendant intended to start the fire.</SPAN></P>

The couple argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-710(6) was prohibited special legislature as there was nothing unique about cases against bar owners under the Dram Shop Act, as compared to negligence cases generally. The supreme court noted that the notice provision operated equally upon every person who sought redress under the Dram Shop Act. The classification was reasonable. The statute was not unconstitutional as special legislation prohibited by Mont. Const. art. V, &sect; 12. Dram shop plaintiffs were similarly situated as others who alleged negligence. Section 27-1-710(6) was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and did not violate Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Montana Workers' Compensation Court (WCC) issued summonses to more than 500 insurers regarding their obligation under a prior case to identify and pay past Schmill-type claims. Respondent insurers moved to dismiss. The WCC denied the insurers' motion and certified the issues as final for purposes of appeal. The insurers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurers argued that the WCC's enforcement of the prior cases violated due process under the Montana and United States Constitutions. They argued that they were not named parties and were not given notice or opportunity to be heard when the supreme court found Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-72-706&nbsp;unconstitutional and when the first case created a global common fund. The supreme court found that prior case holdings confirmed that claimants had a vested right to payment of past due benefits, regardless of which insurer was responsible. Due process was not violated when a court construed the meaning of a statute applicable to all workers' compensation insurers bound by uniform laws. Once all potential beneficiaries were granted a vested right, a corresponding duty to pay on the part of all insurers arose automatically as a matter of law. Appellee employee's standing to bring an in rem action to enforce the common fund attorney fees liens was reinforced by the supreme court's prior decision. The lien did not simply attach to the employee's benefits alone. It attached to the entire common fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.

He also testified that he did not shoot himself or the other victim, and that he did not believe that the other victim accidentally shot either victim. The court also held that no Brady violation occurred, even though the State did not disclose the attempt victim's statement to a counselor that he felt guilty about the shooting incident, because the State disclosed the name of the counselor as a person with whom the victim discussed the shooting and there was other testimony about the victim's feelings of guilt. Defendant waived an argument on the use of a non-visible leg restraint during trial without a finding that his behavior warranted the brace because his only objection was to the visibility of restraints. Defendant was not entitled to plain error review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State alleged in the information and supporting affidavit that defendant purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to her then 8-year-old adopted son, by slapping him multiple times hard enough to leave bruises on his face. Defendant was found guilty following a two-day trial, and was sentenced to three years. Defendant argued that the district court erred in allowing two witnesses to testify via video, alleging that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-229(1) was unconstitutional. The State argued that defendant failed to support her constitutional challenge with precedent, reasoning, or analysis. The reviewing court agreed. Defendant's substantive analysis consisted of a one-paragraph, largely conclusory argument, which was a wholly inadequate and inappropriate presentation of a constitutional challenge. Defendant's constitutional challenge was improvidently considered, poorly briefed, and inadequately supported by an appropriate record. Also, defendant had not provided a transcript of the sentencing hearing in support of her claim that the written judgment conflicted with the oral pronouncement of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The workers all suffered work-related injuries. At issue on appeal was the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-710. The workers claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it denied permanent total disability (PTD) benefits to the workers and other similarly situated individuals on the basis of their age. The workers also argued that the statute violated the equal protection and substantive due process clauses, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, and illegally discriminated based on age. In the supreme court's equal protection analysis, it agreed with the WCC's determination that the classes were similar. The workers' age, as defined by the eligibility requirements of receiving SSRI, was the only identifiable differentiating factor between the two classes. Applying a rational basis level of review, the supreme court concluded that retirement at a statutorily defined at a given age for purposes of terminating PTD entitlements did not make the statute per se irrational. Further, the WCC's discussion of cost was appropriate. As to the argument that &sect; 39-71-710 violated substantive due process, these rights were not violated by the lack of a quid pro quo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union and the employer were parties to a collective bargaining agreement.

On appeal, the employee maintained that the district court's opinion and order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration was void. The employer reasoned that the present action was moot, there was no justiciable controversy between the parties, and the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The appellate court focused on whether there was a live controversy before the district court and not whether there was a live controversy before the arbitrator. The employer maintained that the agreement's arbitration clause did not apply to the union's complaint; however, the district court was in a position to grant effective relief by either granting the union's motion or grant the employer's motion to dismiss.

Appellant challenged the denial of his motion to dismiss and the order of the Youth Court, District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, County of Cascade, Montana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After unsuccessfully attempting to withdraw from a consent adjustment, appellant raised, inter alia, the following issues: (1) whether Mont.

The consent adjustment advised appellant of his basic legal rights guaranteed by law, and the youth court held hearings at which appellant was represented by counsel and entitled to contest the allegations that he violated his probation. Furthermore, by admitting to violations of the consent adjustment, appellant waived any claim that the State failed to bear its burden of proof. By permitting the youth court to enforce the violation of informal consent adjustments without requiring a petition or finding that a youth was delinquent or in need of intervention, Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A citizen on his way to work encountered a truck stopped in the middle of the road, in the wrong lane of travel, flashing a turn signal. The citizen called 911. Defendant admitted that he had been drinking the evening before and the citizen and officers all noted a strong odor of alcohol about him. His speech was slurred and difficult to understand, his eyes were red and bloodshot, and he was unsteady on his feet. On appeal, defendant contended that the district court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that the officers lacked probable cause to make an arrest. Paradoxically, defendant also contended that he was not arrested the night of the incident. The supreme court concluded that the facts observed by the officers presented ample cause to charge defendant. Therefore, the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss. As to defendant's motion to suppress evidence, defendant presented no cogent argument why photographs of items that were concededly in plain and open view could not be seized as evidence. Further, defendant's refusal to take a breath test was admissible, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2).</SPAN></P>

The trial court reinstated her probation and placed her in a youth home. The second juvenile entered into a consent adjustment in which he admitted committing numerous offenses, including disorderly conduct, theft, and runaway. The State later filed a petition to revoke his probation. The trial court placed him in a group home. On appeal, the juveniles challenged the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-1512. The court found that they did not properly preserve their argument that the statute was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of felony sexual assault. The victims were two teenage boys. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the mental state of knowingly in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-101(35). The offense of sexual assault under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-502(1) required that an accused knowingly make sexual contact with another. It was the particularized conduct of making sexual contact under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-101(67) that the statute made criminal. Defendant admitted that one boy touched his testicle and that he put the other boy's hand in his pants. Further, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's proposed jury instructions on misdemeanor assault as a lesser included offense of sexual assault under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-1-202(9). Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. The trial court believed that the prosecutor did not intend to elicit evidence of defendant's anger and pushing of his former girlfriend. When it denied defendant's motion for a mistrial, the trial court necessarily concluded that he was not prejudiced by the girlfriend's  statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee partner one sought to dissolve the parties' common law marriage and to receive a parenting interest in the minor children. Ultimately, the parties were divorced, and the Fourth Judicial District Court of Missoula County, Montana, awarded partner one a parental interest in the minor children over the objection of appellant partner two, as well as an interest in personal and real property. Partner two appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In this dispute between same-sex parents, partner two contended on review, inter alia, that she stood as the fit natural parent to the minor children, and partner one failed to prove the mandatory requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-228(2)(a)-(b). The supreme court disagreed, finding first that partner two failed to carry her burden of proving that the statutes she challenged impermissibly infringed on her constitutional right to parent her children. Further, partner one functioned in a parental role from the first day that the children came to the parties through the end of the parties' relationship. Substantial evidence supported the district court's determination that partner two repeatedly and continually acted contrary to her child-parent relationship. Partner one met the criteria of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-211(6) through the fact that partner two consented to and fostered the parent-like relationship between partner one and the children. Continuing partner one's relationship with the minor children was in the children's best interests; doctors testified that the children would suffer irreparable harm should the parenting time be denied to partner one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee county filed a petition for a restraining order seeking to prohibit appellant casino from erecting additional artificial palm trees. The Third Judicial District Court, Powell County, Montana, held a hearing on the petition and issued a restraining order. The casino filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial, which was denied. The casino appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The casino had erected lighted, artificial palm trees. The casino submitted an application for a condition use permit (CUP). The planning department recommended that the planning board approve the gambling casino and logo sign but deny the palm trees and a LCD sign. At issue was whether: (1) the county planning board had jurisdiction to require the casino to apply for a CUP; (2) the erection of 50 artificial lighted palm trees constituted a change in use under zoning and development regulations; and (3) the county's enforcement of the zoning and development regulations substantially complied with its growth policy. The district court's decision was based upon substantial credible evidence. The supreme court could not conclude that the county abused its discretion by denying portions the CUP application that were inconsistent with its growth policy. That policy, which focused on maintenance of open spaces and historic heritage, reasonably promoted the general welfare of the community. The casino's private property rights were not infringed when the planning board denied portions of the CUP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a negligence action claiming an inadequate response to a 911 call and an unlawful arrest, plaintiff store clerk appealed summary judgment granted by the District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Gallatin, Montana, in favor of defendant law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the store clerk was working, a robber entered, held a knife to her throat, and demanded money. The store clerk was able to surreptitiously dial 911 on her cell phone but could not speak to the 911 operator. Dispatchers were able to discern that a robbery was taking place, worked to identify the location, and dispatched law enforcement officers. While officers were on scene outside of the darkened store, the store clerk was raped by the robber, who was immediately arrested when he exited the store. On review of summary judgment, the court held that the law enforcement agencies could not be held liable for failing to protect the store clerk from the rape because, as a matter of law, the responding officers did not have custody or control of either the robber or the store clerk at the time the rape occurred, and they did not gain control of the robber until he exited the store and was placed under arrest. Further, the store clerk was not the subject of an unlawful arrest because her placement in handcuffs after exiting the store was tantamount to an investigative stop and was necessary for the protection of the officers while they ascertained her identity and role in the events.</SPAN></P>

The potential firefighter appealed from the jury verdict and posttrial rulings in the Second Judicial District Court, in and for the County of Silver Bow (Montana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The potential firefighter had applied for a position with the county on several occasions. When a position eventually became open, the potential firefighter was 35 years old, which was one year older than the age limit in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-33-4107. The potential firefighter challenged the constitutionality of the statute. Applying a rational basis level of review, the supreme court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional. The limitation in the statute was wholly arbitrary. Firefighters in their 50's could perform their functions competently, which demonstrated that the age limitation was without a rational basis. The 34 year-old age limitation bore no rational relation to the purported objective of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Eighteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Gallatin (Montana) of theft for knowingly exercising unauthorized control of a welder to deprive the owner of its use, a felony under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-301(1). The district court deferred imposition of her sentence for three years, subject to various conditions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A welder was stolen from a construction company. Defendant pawned the welder at a pawn shop for $ 800, which she said she needed to bail her boyfriend out of jail. Later, she and the boyfriend borrowed additional money against the welder. A construction company employee saw the welder in the shop, leading to defendant's arrest. Defendant argued at trial and on appeal that there was no evidence that she knew the welder was stolen when she pawned it, and that the jury should have been instructed that such knowledge was required. The court held that under &sect; 45-6-301(1), the State was not required to prove that defendant knew the welder was stolen, contrasting subsection (1) to &sect; 45-6-301(3), under which knowledge was explicitly required. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that defendant could not be found guilty of theft absent proof that she knew the welder was stolen. Furthermore, defendant's arguments regarding the prosecutor's conduct also arose from her mistaken belief that the prosecution was required to prove she knew the welder was stolen; those arguments were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and the supreme court affirmed. An expert's testimony failed to establish that defendants breached a national standard of care. Assuming arguendo that the expert's deposition testimony sufficed to establish the various national standards of care, importantly, his opinion that defendants deviated from the applicable standards was premised on the assumption that there was not an anesthesiologist &quot;immediately available&quot; to the after the mother's epidural was administered. The undisputed facts showed that there was no breach of any standard of care for the failure to have an anesthesiologist immediately available at all relevant times. An anesthesiologist was immediately available at all relevant times.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimed that concern by jurors regarding the size of the potential verdict denied him a fair trial and violated due process, that the district court erred by denying his motion for change of venue under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-2-201, and that the district court erred when it refused to allow the jury to consider the source of payment for any damages that could be awarded under Mont. R. Evid. 411. On appeal, the court held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-15-302(2), which contained the juror qualifications, did not violate the provisions of the Montana or the U.S. Constitutions as being a taxpayer of a county or district that was a party to an action did not provide a reason for disqualification. In addition, the district court did not err by denying appellant's motion for change of venue because nothing from the voir dire or other evidence led the court to believe that the jury would have been unwilling to deliver a verdict in appellant's favor. Finally, the district court did not err with regard to the jury's consideration of the source of payment as appellant had ample opportunity to question the jurors about the possibility of having to issue a large award.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-701(7) was unconstitutional; whether the WCC had jurisdiction and authority to find the worker guilty of violating Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-701(7); whether the WCC correctly applied the definition of wages in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-132(1)(d); and whether the WCC correctly applied the principle of &quot;real economic gain.&quot; The supreme court concluded that the WCC correctly determined that the worker received wages or other income from another source; the worker received TTD benefits at the same time he received wages; and the worker did not obtain written consent the insurer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order of the District Court for the Second Judicial District, Silver Bow County, Montana, granting defendant's motion to suppress all of the evidence obtained from a search of his residence after the police received a report of sexual assault upon his thirteen-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer responded to a report of sexual assault. The thirteen-year-old victim invited the officer into the living room, and told him that defendant, her father, had sexually assaulted her the previous evening. The officer asked the victim to show him where the alleged assault had taken place. When a detective arrived, he took photographs of the victim's bedroom and began collecting evidence. The officers took possession of the bed clothes, the victim's pajamas, and the underwear that she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault. The district court granted defendant's motion to suppress all of the evidence seized during the warrantless search of his home. The Supreme Court of Montana held that the victim did not have actual authority to consent to a search, because she was under the age of sixteen. The officers were obligated to obtain valid consent from defendant or a search warrant prior to seizing items from his daughter's bedroom. The items were not in the officer's plain view. Defendant was not entitled to suppress evidence of the victim's underwear, because he did not have an expectation of privacy in the underwear.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a petition for writ of supervisory control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the State contended the district court erred by dismissing defendant's failure to remain charge on grounds that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-7-103 was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court agreed, finding that &sect; 61-7-103 provided persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the conduct it prohibited. The district court applied the wrong standard in determining that &sect; 61-7-103 was unconstitutional; even defendant conceded that a person who offered no assistance could be prosecuted under this statute. Even assuming that defendant was obtaining aid for his girlfriend (who later died as a result of injuries she sustained in the accident) when he walked home, the failure-to-remain statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to his actions. An ordinary person would have had fair notice that the statute applied to a driver (defendant) who, after an accident, left someone &quot;gurgling and still alive&quot;; walked home past several houses where he could have called 911; gave his keys to his friends to go back to the accident scene while he laundered his bloody clothes and took a shower; and did not call 911 for help or to report the accident until after 20 hours had elapsed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of the Twenty-First Judicial District, In and For the County of Ravalli (Montana) of seven counts of incest, three counts of assault on a minor, and bail jumping. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court abused its discretion when it denied defendant's challenge for cause of potential juror. The supreme court disagreed. The juror never expressed a fixed opinion of defendant's guilt or actual bias against defendant. While there was much questioning about the juror's ability to fairly weigh testimony from a detective against other testimony, that was significantly different than the type of improper state of mind that raised serious doubts about a juror's ability to be fair and impartial. The district court excused ten potential jurors for cause as a result of admissions that jurors could not be fair; would shift the burden of proof to defendant; could not base a decision solely on the evidence; or had personal experiences that affected their judgment. The district court clarified whether the juror was willing to consider opposing testimony and surrounding circumstances for consistency. The juror acknowledged that he would &quot;look for consistency&quot; and &quot;very heartily&quot; go where that led him. Since the juror's answers did not denote a &quot;clearly stated bias,&quot; there was no way that the district court could have coaxed him to recant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentences on incest counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 were vacated and remanded for resentencing in accordance with the statutes in effect at the time of the offenses. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff advocacy group sought an order invalidating Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-205(7) as being facially unconstitutional due to its alleged failure to balance the public's right to know against the rights of individual privacy. The District Court of the First Judicial District, County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, granted summary judgment, upheld the statute, and denied the advocacy group's request for attorneys fees. The advocacy group appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An advocacy group filed an action seeking public dissemination of a final report discussing the results of an investigation of abuse and neglect at a child care agency. Defendant, the State Department of Health and Human Services, cautioned that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-205(7) required the report to remain confidential. Based on an in camera inspection, the district court permitted the advocacy group to distribute the report with certain information redacted. The advocacy group raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-205. The district court determined that the fact that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-205(7) allowed a balance between privacy interests and the right to know precluded a determination that the statute was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Montana upheld the decision, because Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-205(2) provided a mechanism for a court to evaluate on a case by case basis whether the public's right to know exceeded the individual rights to privacy. The advocacy group was not entitled to recover its attorney fees, as the statute was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A justice court convicted defendant of obstructing a peace officer, a misdemeanor in violation of Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the deputy did not have particularized suspicion to detain him or probable cause to arrest and charge him; his refusal to provide his name to the deputy was protected by the self-incrimination privilege; the obstructing statute was unconstitutionally vague; and he was denied equal protection and due process when the district court refused to allow him to testify based on his refusal to take an oath or affirm. The supreme court disagreed, holding that there was particularized suspicion to justify the stop of defendant and probable cause to arrest him for obstructing based on defendant's evasive behavior at 2 a.m. and his ensuing refusal to provide his name. Defendant's right against self-incrimination did not protect him from having to provide his name to the deputy as providing his name provided no reasonable danger that he would incriminate himself. The obstructing statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant failed to show that the imposition of the oath or affirmation requirement in Mont. R. Evid. 603 denied him equal protection of the laws, due process, or otherwise impinged upon his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the District Court of the Twenty-First Judicial District, in and for the County of Ravalli (Montana), which revoked her suspended sentence on the ground that she failed to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of deceptive practices for making unauthorized charges to the credit card of her fiance's mother and for making a false credit card application in the mother's name. She pled guilty to the charges and agreed to pay restitution. The trial court sentenced her to a five-year suspended sentence on each count. The trial court later revoked the suspended sentence on the ground that she failed to fulfill her restitution obligation. The trial court resentenced her to five years suspended for each of the counts. The trial court also sentenced her to serve 30 days in jail. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's suspended sentence based upon her failure to pay restitution. She never made any payments to the Montana Department of Corrections, nor did she at any time contact the credit card companies to make sure they had been paid. Because the trial court revoked defendant's suspended sentence under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii) (2001), the condition requiring her to spend 30 days in jail was an additional, more burdensome condition, and the trial court had no authority to impose it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment sentencing defendant to 30 days in jail and remanded the case to the trial court to strike that condition. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
