<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985, and 1988, in the First Judicial District Court (Montana) seeking to address alleged deprivations of his rights by defendant prison officials. The trial court granted the officials' motion to dismiss the complaint. The inmate appealed, and the supreme court remanded the case to the trial court. On remand, the trial court dismissed his remaining claims. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued the trial court erred in granting judgment to the prison officials without first conducting a hearing. The supreme court's direction to &quot;remand for further proceedings,&quot; did not require the trial court to conduct a hearing. Accordingly, the supreme court held that the trial court did not err when declining to conduct a hearing on remand. The inmate next argued that the trial court erred in holding that he failed to state a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court held that his claims were barred by Heck v. Humphrey. The inmate argued that, unlike Heck, his claim did not implicate the validity of his continued incarceration. He stated that, as his sentence was for a total of 194 years, a favorable ruling on earned good time credits would only allow him an earlier parole appearance. The supreme court held that that the inmate's claims, if proven, would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence and were therefore not cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, unless his conviction or sentence was invalidated. His claims were not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and could have been brought in a habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant appealed from the order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County (Montana), denying his petition for postconviction relief. The district court found defendant's petition for postconviction relief was timely, however, relying on case law, the district court found that defendant's case was final and not pending on direct review, and that the rule in Guillaume could not be retroactively applied to his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was sentenced, the court added an additional 10 years for the use of a weapon in the commission of a criminal offense pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-221, MCA (1993). The rule in Guillaume was announced subsequently: enhancing a defendant's sentence for the use of a weapon pursuant to &sect; 46-18-221, where the underlying offense required proof of the use of a weapon, violated the double jeopardy provision of the Montana Constitution. Defendant moved for resentencing, and, while that motion was pending, petitioned for postconviction relief. The district court denied the petition. The defendant asserted on appeal that the district court erred in denying his petition by not retroactively applying the rule in Guillaume, and urged the court to overrule prior case law to allow for retroactive application of Guillaume. The court did so, finding that the petition was timely, that the rule in Guillaume was substantive and that substantive rules should be given retroactive application, and that it was illogical to deny constitutional protections to citizens simply because their claim was raised by collateral review rather than by way of direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's denial of postconviction relief, and remanded for resentencing in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted in the Cascade County District Court (Montana) of sexual intercourse without consent. The defendant was given a deferred sentence with several conditions attached. The State filed a motion to revoke the deferred sentence for various violations. The court granted the motion and sentenced the defendant to prison. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by imposing a condition that he was not allowed within Cascade County. The supreme court agreed. The banishment condition imposed by the trial court violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-202(1)(e) (1997), as the condition was not reasonably related to the goals of rehabilitation and was broader than necessary to protect the victim. The record established that the trial court had facts before it at the time of sentencing that would have rendered the condition unduly severe and punitive to the point of being unrelated to rehabilitation. Specifically, the defendant was residing in Cascade County at the time of the sentencing hearing and had family there. However, the defendant had no family in Lewis and Clark County. In addition to imposing the banishment condition, the trial court imposed less restrictive means to rehabilitate the defendant and to protect the victim and society, including the imposition of the following requirements: that he obtain sexual offender treatment and have no contact with the victim or her family. Therefore, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revocation of probation was affirmed. Certain conditions imposed by the trial court were vacated, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative required the electorate to vote on whether to impose term limits on ten separate elective offices in one ballot proposition. The candidates argued, inter alia, that the doctrine of laches was inapplicable because a ripe case or controversy did not exist until the fall of 2001 when the candidates each decided to seek re-election for a third term. The supreme court disagreed. Contrary to the candidates' assertions, the controversy was neither hypothetical nor speculative prior to their decisions in the fall of 2001 to seek re-election for a third term. If the process by which the initiative was enacted was invalid as the candidates claimed, then it was invalid in November 1992 when the initiative was enacted and the case or controversy was ripe at that time. The doctrine of laches barred the candidates from challenging the process by which the voters approved the initiative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because the game warden illegally stepped onto his boat and conducted an inspection of his catch. The supreme court disagreed. In attempting to inspect the defendant's catch, the warden merely placed a foot upon the transom of the boat, an exterior platform which was readily accessible to the public. In so doing, the warden did not disturb any personal property or gain access to any place not readily visible from a higher vantage point. Once the warden lawfully stepped on the transom, he could see into the open live well. That plain view observation revealed that the defendant possessed additional fish, in excess of his legal limit. The observation allowed the warden to remove the excess fish from the live well and issue the unlawfully killed game fish citation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the restraining order granted by the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County (Montana), prohibiting the inclusion or public posting of defendant's name and approximate address on the county's sex offender register.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to 20 years on one count of sexual assault and 25 years on four counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The sentences ran concurrently, and defendant was paroled in March 1993. Defendant stated that he received no notice from officials at the Montana State Prison directing him to register as a sexual offender under the provisions of the Sexual Offender Registration Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-501 et seq. (1989). The trial court observed that, by the time the legislature got around to making the law retroactive in 1997, defendant had discharged his sentence and had his full civil rights restored and ruled that the Act did not apply to him. Defendant argued that he achieved constitutional protection from the authority of the Act when he completed his sentence in May 1996, and cited the guarantee of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 28(2). The Montana Supreme Court ruled that defendant's convictions for multiple sexual offenses and his incarceration at the time of the Act in 1989, placed him under the authority of the registration statutes, as well as the subsequent, retroactively applied amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's appearance bonds were forfeited and his hunting privileges suspended when he failed to appear on various hunting violation charges. The Powder River County District Court (Montana) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court erred by dismissing his appeal because he perfected it within 10 days of judgment. The statutory basis for an appeal following trial, outlined by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-17-311(2) was consistent with the constitutional requirement of a trial anew on appeal, which presupposed a prior trial. The judgment rendered in the defendant's case followed a forfeiture of bonds posted to secure his appearance in justice court. Bond forfeiture served the same procedural role as a conviction under Montana's wildlife management laws. The post-forfeiture judgment included no jail time, and his fines were limited to the amount of the bonds and the restitution he paid for the three slain game animals. If a defendant was automatically entitled to a trial de novo on appeal without first having a justice court trial, a defendant could avoid justice court altogether. By not appearing, and forfeiting the justice court bonds, a defendant could then pursue a trial in district court and render the justice court system meaningless. Therefore, the district court did not err.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowners built a road to their property upon a county road easement. Appellant farm owners sued the landowners and respondent title company claiming that the easement had been abandoned. The District Court of the Twenty-Second Judicial District, County of Carbon (Montana), ordered the parties into mediation and subsequently issued a confirmation of arbitration award and judgment. The farm owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitrator provided an injunction against any further action by the farm owners concerning the disputed roadway. The arbitrator also awarded attorney fees to the landowners and the trust company against the farm owners. The primary issue on appeal was whether the district court abused its discretion by confirming the arbitrator's award of attorney fees. The district court found the settlement agreement did not expressly preclude attorney fees based on the &quot;hold harmless&quot; language therein, and in its review, the supreme court noted it was sufficient for a court merely to determine that the arbitrator could rationally derive a remedy of attorney fees. Further, the supreme court noted the farm owners' behavior in the action had been malicious and reprehensible, and therefore there was a reasonable basis for an award of attorney fees. Finally, the supreme court rejected the farm owners' argument that the arbitrator's award was so broadly written that it effectively took their property without due process, as the road was a public road, in which they had no interest, and the injunctive language only restrained the farm owners from contesting matters previously decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

There was blood on a door knob in the victim's house. After his arrest, the police swabbed the defendant's hands to obtain a sample of the blood. They did not have a warrant. The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because the evidence was obtained without exigent circumstances. The supreme court agreed. The search was not conducted in accordance with the rationale permitting a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. It was not done to prevent the defendant from using a weapon or from escaping. Its purpose was not to discover or seize the fruits of the crime, nor was it conducted to preserve evanescent evidence. From the record, it was clear the police knew that the blood they swabbed and sent in for analysis was the defendant's blood, and not the blood of a victim that could be washed away unless taken at once. Therefore, the search was illegal and the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. While not reaching the issue on the merits, the supreme court found that the defendant's challenge to the panel had not been timely. While the defendant had a right to be tried by a jury whose members were selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria, that right must have been exercised in a timely manner. The defendant's counsel waited until after the jury was impaneled and sworn and the venire dismissed to raise his Batson challenge. If counsel were allowed to raise a Batson challenge after the jury was impaneled and sworn and the venire dismissed, not only would that impair the ability of the challenged attorney to effectively defend his or her strikes, but it would also deprive the trial court of the ability to correct any error in the proceedings in a timely fashion.

Later, he checked himself into a different clinic in Kansas and signed an application for admission as a voluntary patient and a form outlining the rules and procedures relating to the discharge of voluntary patients. He remained at the clinic until his treatment was completed, although he was aware he could leave. The doctor could have refused to obtain the evaluation and treatment recommended by MPAP. At that point, if he had been suspended, he would have been entitled to a hearing. He had a legal remedy and he chose a different course of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to six months in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised probation, for a felony driving under the influence of alcohol conviction. Defendant was released from confinement after serving the six months in prison. At that time, her two-year probationary sentence began. A little more than one year later, the State petitioned for revocation. Defendant appeared before the trial court and admitted violating her probation by failing to comply with numerous laws, failing to report those violations to her probation officer, and consuming alcohol. Despite defendant's argument she could not be incarcerated for probation violations since she had served her entire six-month prison term, the trial court sentenced her to serve in prison the time remaining on her original two-year probation. After she was sentenced, the state supreme court found she did not meet her burden of showing that the sentencing statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. 61-8-731, was unconstitutional as it applied to her.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner probationers and the State sought a rehearing of the court's decisions in two cases involving application of former Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-1012 (1999) (amended 2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former &sect; 46-23-1012(4) (1999) had required a probable cause hearing within 36 hours of a probation violator's arrest; the court had held in both of the cases in question that the hearing was mandatory only when the arrest was made pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge. The legislature amended &sect; 46-23-1012 to delete the hearing requirement and made the amendment retroactive to offenders who were under the custody or supervision of the Montana Department of Corrections on May 1, 2001. The court found that it was not prohibited from applying its interpretation of former &sect; 46-23-1012 (1999) retroactively, as the statute had not previously been interpreted. One of the probationers claimed that application of amended &sect; 46-23-1012 (2001) to him would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, but the court found no such violation because the elimination of the hearing requirement did not alter the definition of or the punishment for the probationer's alleged probation violations. In addition, violation of the former hearing requirement voided the original revocation proceedings, so the State was entitled to proceed anew against the probationer under the amended statute.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the State notified the defendant two and one-half months before trial that it would seek to treat him as a persistent felony offender; the record established his only objection and argument were broad, general comments; and he provided the trial court no briefing, no analysis, and no citation to any supporting authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, imprisoned on a guilty plea to one count of negligent homicide, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the Department of Corrections (department) improperly denied him good time credits for the time he spent in the prison's boot camp program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, sentenced to five years imprisonment on his guilty plea and sent to the Montana State Prison (MSP), sought admission to the state's boot camp incarceration program. Before entering the program he signed a disclosure statement which acknowledged that he would be ineligible for good time credits upon entering into the program. Petitioner spent 83 days in the program, but owing to a series of infractions, did not complete the program. As a consequence, he earned neither a sentence reduction nor the good time credits he might have earned had he stayed in the MSP. The Supreme Court of Montana held that the department did not deprive him of his due property rights by refusing to award him good time credits for the time spent in boot camp. Although the opportunity to earn good time credits was a protected liberty interest, petitioner made an informed and voluntary choice to relinquish that interest. The non-waiver rule of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 1-3-204 was held not to apply to the good time statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-30-105 (1991). Allowing petitioner to waive his interest in good time credits did not defeat the purpose of the good time statute.</SPAN></P>

He challenged his convictions, arguing the fish and game residency requirements were facially unconstitutional as void for vagueness because residency was defined approximately seven different ways under Montana statutes and administrative rules. The appellate court initially noted Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1-215, Montana's general residency statute, provided if a person claimed a residence within the state for any purpose, then that location was the person's residence for all purposes unless there was a specific statutory exception. The appellate court held Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-2-102 (1995) clearly provided a specific statutory exception to the general definition of residence for purposes of obtaining a Montana fishing, hunting, or trapping license. The appellate court concluded defendant's argument was unmeritorious, as he failed to establish that the residency requirements for obtaining a resident hunting license set forth in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-2-102 (1995) were facially unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</SPAN></P>

The Fourth Judicial District Court, Montana, deferred imposition of sentence and placed petitioner on probation. Petitioner's probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to prison time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged in his habeas corpus petition that he was improperly denied good time credits for time he spent on probation, and that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-30-105 (1993), which granted good time credits to parolees but not probationers, violated petitioner's equal protection rights. The Supreme Court of Montana held that petitioner was not denied good time credits without due process.  Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-30-105(3) (1993) did not create a liberty interest in good time credits for probationers and, therefore, petitioner was not entitled to due process before they could be denied. The supreme court held that the appropriate standard of review for equal protection challenges to Montana's good time allowance statute was the rational basis test. There was no merit in petitioner's claim that he was improperly denied credit for time served on probation against his sentence of incarceration. Further, there was no constitutional basis for petitioner's claim that he was illegally restrained of his freedom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case concerned the deregulation of electricity generating utilities in Montana under recent legislation. Foreseeing imminent uncertainty in the costs of electricity, power company proposed that a current estimation of some, but not all, transition costs be deferred, and &quot;tracked,&quot; in some instances for as long as the next 25 to 30 years, so that a more accurate figure could be determined in the future. The commission determined that the proposed &quot;trackers&quot; cost accounting system, which would have adjusted transition costs in the future as such costs accrued, rather than reaching a current estimated fixed sum, was not consistent with the Act's requirements. The instant court determined that the constitutional takings issue was not ripe for adjudication, as company had not been deprived of any property, and any future loss was speculative. The instant court held that the commission correctly interpreted the Act when it denied company's proposed &quot;trackers&quot; accounting method for recovering transition costs. A judicial mandate directed at the commission to allow the use of the &quot;trackers&quot; method would have required it to bend if not violate the law and could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of several felonies in three different district courts. Those courts imposed various combinations of suspended sentences and prison commitments, and respondent ultimately awarded petitioner a total of 81 days of jail good time credit toward his 10-year suspended sentence. Petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus. The Montana trial court denied the petition, and petitioner filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that respondent's policy of awarding good time for presentence incarceration at the rate of 10 days per month constituted an impermissible wealth-based classification. The supreme court denied the petition. The court first held that although petitioner had been released from prison, the discharge date of the 10-year suspended sentence he was serving depended on the good time credit to which he was entitled. Therefore petitioner's claim was not moot. However, on the merits, it was virtually impossible to apply Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-30-105 (1993) to pretrial detainees because the statute was not designed to apply to prisoners housed in county jails. Petitioner incorrectly assumed a security classification for presentence jail time before a classification had been assigned. The court concluded that respondent had adopted a reasonable policy in determining that pretrial detainees were entitled to no more than 10 days of good time per month based on the pre-1995 statute, which was the amount accorded to state prisoners assigned maximum and medium security classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued respondent to void Bozeman, Mont., Mun. Ordinance No. 1490, &sect;&sect; 2.06.050, 2.06.030 that prohibited outside employment by the municipal court judge and placed the municipal court clerk under respondent's finance department's supervision. On appeal of the trial court's judgment, the instant court held the trial court properly determined that &sect;&sect; 2.06.050, 2.06.030 were invalid. Section 2.06.050, which prohibited a municipal court judge from having outside employment, conflicted with Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-1-601(1), 3-1-604, which allowed judges to practice law in any court but their own. By placing the municipal court clerk under respondent's supervision, Bozeman, Mont., Mun. Ordinance No. 1490, &sect; 2.06.030 usurped the power of the municipal court to conduct its business, since the clerk was a ministerial officer. Because the trial court summarily disposed of appellant's attorney fees claim without giving her the opportunity to present evidence, the court reversed that portion of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a licensed attorney who had a business office in Great Falls, Montana. He was cited for failure to obtain a safety inspection certificate for his law office. Defendant moved to dismiss the charge in the Municipal Court on the basis that attorneys were licensed and regulated by the Montana Supreme Court, and the certificate requirement impermissibly subjected him to city licensing. The Municipal Court denied the motion to dismiss, and found defendant guilty of failure to obtain the certificate. Defendant was fined $ 105 plus a $ 15 surcharge. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss to the District Court. The District Court also denied the motion. Defendant again appealed. The Supreme Court affirmed. Defendant failed to establish that the certificate requirement of Great Falls City, Mont., Code &sect; 5.01.070 unconstitutionally impinged on the Supreme Court's power to regulate attorneys. The application of the certificate requirement to the city's law offices represented a minimal and inoffensive intrusion on the Supreme Court's constitutional prerogative to regulate attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed, since the safety inspection certificate ordinance was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that appellant suffered from paranoid-type schizophrenia, that she had a history of treatment and medication non-compliance, and that she was unable to care for herself. The court ordered that appellant be committed to a mental health center and that medication was necessary for her treatment. Appellant sought review, contending that the court could not order that she &quot;agree to take medication as prescribed&quot; as it was stated in the order, absent findings that she was incompetent. The supreme court affirmed, holding first that there was no common law right to refuse medication, and the statutes clearly indicated a court's authority to order that a mentally ill person be involuntarily medicated. Further, appellant was not deprived of due process; the trial court properly found that appellant had a &quot;mental disorder&quot; that rendered her unable to consent to voluntary treatment. Finally, the trial court's findings as a whole clearly indicated the reasons that involuntary medication was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment affirmed. Appellant's premise that she was not found to be incompetent was false; the trial court properly found that appellant suffered from a mental disorder as statutorily defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant electrical contractor appealed the judgment of the Cascade County District Court (Montana) entered in favor of plaintiff wife in her wrongful death action against defendant. Plaintiff cross-appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in reducing her award by the amount received from other defendants and workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued to recover damages for the wrongful death of her husband, who died as a result of burns sustained while repairing a pump above a gasoline storage tank. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to disqualify plaintiff's counsel on the ground that counsel had previously represented defendant. Defendant did nothing for six years after the trial court denied its motion, and failed to explain the delay. On appeal defendant sought a new trial on the merits, a remedy it failed to raise in its motion. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by entering default judgment against defendant as a sanction for discovery violations because the record showed that defendant willfully and in bad faith kept from plaintiff the extent of the electrical work it performed on the pump. Plaintiff was prejudiced because she did not uncover the information until days before trial. Because Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 did not create a fundamental right to recover attorney fees, the trial court erred by reducing defendant's right to offset for collateral source payments by the amount of plaintiff's attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed insofar as it denied defendant's motion to disqualify plaintiff's counsel and entered default judgment against defendant as a sanction for discovery misconduct. Judgment reversed insofar as it reduced defendant's right to offset the award by plaintiff's attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner school district challenged these statutes as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority after respondent landowners obtained a transfer of their land into respondent school district.

It was the broad grant of discretion to a county superintendent of schools, unchecked by any standard, policy, or rule of decision, that rendered the territory transfer statute unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed denial, by Seventh Judicial District Court, Blaine County (Montana), of his petition for reinstatement of Montana driving privileges suspended after refusal to take a breath test. He argued that officers denied him due process by failure to describe consequences for nonresidents and in seizing his Wyoming license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Wyoming resident challenged Montana's implied consent law, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-402 et seq., after he was deprived of Montana driving privileges after refusal to take a breathalyzer test. The court found that petitioner had not been deprived of U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process. Although the advisory provided at the police station did not describe the consequences of his refusal to take the test under Wyoming law, the advisory accomplished the constitutional objective of assuring that petitioner knew that refusal to take the test would have very serious consequences. In weighing whether this exercise of the police power satisfied due process safeguards, the court weighed petitioner's threatened private interest against the governmental interest, and determined that Montana's interest in keeping drunk drivers off the roads outweighed petitioner's interest, which was protected by numerous procedural safeguards, in retaining possession of his license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of the petition. The advisory, although it did not exactly describe consequences for Wyoming drivers, was constitutionally adequate in communicating the seriousness of failure to submit to a test. Balanced against drunk driving dangers, the slight intrusion on petitioner's rights did not deny due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, personal representative of a decedent's estate, sought review of the order of the District Court of the First Judicial District, In and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), that dismissed her wrongful death suit against appellees, state agencies and private corporations, for failure to have summonses issued within the time limits of Mont. R. Civ. P. 41(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, as personal representative of a decedent's estate, filed a wrongful death action against appellees, state agencies and private companies, but her counsel neglected to have the summonses issued within one year after the complaint was filed, as required by Mont. R. Civ. P. 41(e). The trial court dismissed the complaint under Rule 41(e). Appellant sought review, and the appellate court affirmed. The plain, mandatory language of Rule 41(e) left no room for the court to imply an &quot;excusable neglect&quot; or a &quot;no prejudice&quot; exception to the rule. Appellant's argument that Rule 41(e) was enacted in violation of the Montana Constitution was meritless, as the rule was based on a Montana Supreme Court order, not legislation. The rule did not deprive appellant of the right to full legal redress, as it was a procedural rule applying equally to all litigants. The rule did not deny appellant equal protection, for the same reason.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed, because no &quot;excusable neglect&quot; exception could be read into Mont. R. Civ. P. 41(e), the rule was enacted in conformance with the Montana Constitution, and the rule did not deprive appellant of full legal redress nor violate her right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the dismissal, by the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County (Montana), of his petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The specific statutory provision to which appellant objected was Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1-804(1)(b), which provided for selecting substitute judges. The provision was in effect prior to the crimes of which appellant was convicted. Appellant could have challenged the constitutionality of the provision as early as in his second sentencing proceeding, at which time the statutory procedure was used to select a new judge for appellant's resentencing. The procedural bar providing that postconviction relief was not available upon claims for relief that could have been raised on direct appeal clearly applied. Specifically, appellant requested an evidentiary hearing to allow him to present and develop evidence relative to comments made by the trial court to the media following his sentencing hearing, but before sentence was imposed. Appellant argued that the comments demonstrated bias. The issue was raised on direct appeal and was procedurally barred under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-105(2). The appellate court was hard-pressed to find any allegations by appellant which had not previously been considered in one form or another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's dismissal of petition for postconviction relief was affirmed. Trial court did not err in failing to grant appellant an evidentiary hearing on his allegations that the trial court's post-sentencing actions showed bias toward him and his counsel. All allegations were either previously raised, or should have been raised on direct appeal, and thus were barred from consideration by res judicata or by procedural considerations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his involvement in a work-related automobile accident, appellant challenged the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-1107 (1995), arguing that it violated his equal protection and substantive due process rights by setting a higher payment limit for care received by claimants residing in nursing homes than for those claimants cared for at home by a family member. The trial court also held that the statutory limit was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 39-71-1107 did not violate appellant's rights to equal protection because family member caregivers and non-family member caregivers were not similarly situated, as the differences between the two, including the differences in care provided, justified treating them differently and limiting payment to family member caregivers. Section 39-71-1107 was not arbitrary and capricious because cost containment was only one of the several justifications for treating family member caregivers differently than non-family member caregivers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because Montana's workers' compensation domiciliary care statute was constitutional because it did not violate appellant's rights to equal protection or substantive due process, as differences between family member caregivers and non-family member caregivers justified the legislature's decision to limit payments to family member caregivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit against defendant State of Montana alleging negligence after the rape and murder of his wife by a prison probationer. The parties settled before trial.

The trial court granted the press's motion to intervene and oppose the plaintiff's motion. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion to seal the settlement agreement. The appellate court concluded minors do not have a greater right to privacy than do adults in settlement agreements for tort claims against the State. Plaintiff did not demonstrate that his and his daughter's rights to privacy clearly outweighed the public's right to know what costs the public had incurred in the settlement agreement. Intervenor was not awarded attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

His probation officer, at defendant's home for a routine check, let himself in when no one answered the door. He saw a high school registration form for a female student in plain view. He went next door and questioned defendant's sister, who told him a girl had been living with defendant; he returned to defendant's home, re-read the form and learned that the applicant was 14 years old. Later, the officer found this girl living in defendant's basement. Defendant's probation was revoked; he appealed the revocation and the trial court's denial of his motion to exclude illegally obtained evidence. The court affirmed. Defendant was required under the terms of probation to submit to searches upon reasonable request, but the officer entered his home without making such request. However, the fruit of these entries - knowledge of the girl's presence- was admissible, as this was also derived from an independent source: defendant's sister. The convicted sex offender's claim that he did not know that harboring an underage girl would violate the &quot;good citizenship&quot; terms of his probation was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shot an arrow at a police officer. He claimed that he acted negligently as opposed to purposely or knowingly. The lower court properly ruled that appellant was not entitled to a jury instruction defining a negligent mental state. Crime charged required proof of a knowing or purposeful mental state, and lower court was not required to instruct on mental state of negligence. Appellant was allowed to argue that his actions were negligent; he was not precluded from articulating his defense. Negligent endangerment was not a lesser-included offense of assault on a peace officer under the provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-1-202(8). Negligent endangerment required negligent conduct rather than purposeful conduct, and risk rather than injury or apprehension. The lower court therefore did not err in refusing to instruct jury on negligent endangerment as a lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant caused a two-car accident. The driver of the other vehicle was killed and a passenger was severely injured. Defendant was charged for his part in the collision. At trial, the State introduced into evidence two prescription medication bottles found in defendant's vehicle on the night of the accident and test results showing prescription medications and alcohol were present in defendant's blood and urine on that night. Defendant testified in his own defense. The jury found defendant guilty of the charged offenses. Judgment was later vacated and remanded for a new trial on grounds the prescription drug evidence was improperly admitted. Upon remand, the trial court granted defendant's motion in limine. Judgment was reversed. The court found Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-701 did not preclude the State from using defendant's testimony from the first trial during its case-in-chief at the second trial. As the court's prior holding that the drug prescription evidence had been improperly admitted was based solely on evidentiary principles and not on a determination the evidence had been obtained illegally, the State was not precluded from using defendant's prior trial testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent district court denied respondent father's ex-wife's motion to modify child support.

Respondent court temporarily ordered the agency to cease and desist from modifying the court's order, and following a hearing, entered a final order enjoining the agency from modifying any support orders issued by a state district court. The court affirmed, holding first that the case presented a justiciable controversy between two adverse parties, appellant agency and respondent father. Respondent court had personal jurisdiction over the appellant agency, based on its continuing jurisdiction over the child support matter and because appellant's appearance constituted a voluntary appearance. Finally, the court held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-5-272, -273 violated the separation of powers doctrine to the extent they granted appellant the &quot;judicial power&quot; to make and enforce binding child support orders without automatic and mandatory judicial review.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial; failing to grant the motion for continuance; and in denying his motion for a directed verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a jury verdict and judgment by the Lincoln County (Montana) District Court, Nineteenth Judicial District, which awarded $ 400,000 in compensatory damages and $ 83,000 in punitive damages, resulting from asbestos exposure in defendants' mine. Plaintiffs cross-appealed evidence admitted and jury instructions regarding the punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued for damages resulting from asbesto exposure in defendants' mine and received compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court allowed the punitive damages to be determined by a two-thirds vote. The court affirmed in part, holding that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-221(6), which required unanimous punitive damages verdicts, directly conflicted with Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 26, which allowed two-thirds verdicts in all civil actions. The court thus held &sect; 27-1-221(6) to be unconstitutional. Punitive damages were not barred by collateral estoppel by virtual representation, because the issues presented were not identical to those in the previous cases. On plaintiffs' cross-appeal, the jury instructions properly made no mention of who would have received the punitive damages. The court reversed in part and remanded for a new trial on the amount of punitive damages, as it was not proper to allow evidence by defendants of other pending asbestos litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part. It was proper to allow a two-thirds vote to determine punitive damages, and the statute requiring a unanimous vote was held unconstitutional. Punitive damages were not barred by collateral estoppel.

He was sentenced to death. Following an unsuccessful appeal, he petitioned for postconviction relief. Upon review, the court affirmed partial summary judgment of his petition. Petitioner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during either the pretrial, trial, or appeal phase. Specifically, petitioner's counsel did not err in failing to object to the psychiatric evaluation procedure conducted by a neutral psychiatrist. Petitioner had no constitutional right to be informed of his Miranda rights with respect to the evaluation. Petitioner could show no prejudice concerning his psychiatric evaluation because the incident was not inquired into at trial. Counsel's decision to refrain from making either an opening statement or a closing argument was sound trial strategy, rather than ineffective assistance. Additional claims raised in petitioner's direct appeal were barred from further review by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged a judgment, based upon jury verdicts, of the District Court of the 16th Judicial District, Garfield County (Montana) convicting defendant husband of two counts of impersonating a public servant and defendant wife of impersonating a public servant by accountability. Two-year deferred sentences, community service, and fines were imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who worked as ranchers, were associated with persons known as the &quot;Freeman.&quot; Several members of the group were suffering financial difficulties due to debts owed to creditors. Consequently, the group went to the county's clerk and recorder's office stating they wanted to establish their own supreme court in the county. Later, several documents were sent to the clerk and recorder's office that included the typed statement that defendant husband was justice of the peace for the county, along with the written signature of defendant husband. Some of the documents also included defendant wife's written signature and the words that she was an honorable justice for the county. Defendants were convicted of impersonating public servants. Judgments affirmed in part. The applicable statute did not require that defendants falsely pretend to hold a specific position in the public service. Nor was the statute unconstitutionally vague, as it clearly set forth that anyone who pretended to hold a position in the public service with the purpose to induce another to submit to that authority was within the conduct proscribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments affirmed in part. Applicable statute did not require that defendants pretend to be the actual public servants that they were impersonating to be guilty of false impersonation. Case remanded in part, because trial court's decision regarding defendants' motion to dismiss for denial of speedy trial could not be found in the trial court's record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the ruling of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County (Montana), which summarily dismissed appellant's claims of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant took employment with respondent as patent counsel. Respondent allegedly ordered appellant to prepare fraudulent patent applications, and after appellant's refusal to do so, respondent fired him.

Respondent filed a demand for arbitration; appellant stipulated to arbitration of only the WDEA claims. The trial court dismissed all claims on summary judgment. The supreme court reversed, holding that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the WDEA claims after the parties agreed to submit the claims to arbitration. Further, appellant was not precluded from bringing an employment claim by the possibility of disclosure of confidential matters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent and incest. The supreme court affirmed, holding that there was no error in denying defense counsel the opportunity to personally review confidential victim records; the court's in camera review properly protected the privacy of the victim. A 1989 amendment to the statute of limitations on the intercourse charge did not violate ex post facto laws; the amendment did not increase the punishment, but merely expanded the time in which the punishment could be imposed. The prosecutor was not prohibited from discovering facts to aid one victim's recollection of where the incident occurred, and there was no misconduct in eliciting testimony regarding her desire to see appellant convicted, and reiterating that testimony during rebuttal. The minimum prison terms found at Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 45-5-503(3)(a), -507(4) did not invoke disparate treatment based on appellant's status as a sex offender, because he was not sentenced to those minimums.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been living with a woman for over two years when they were involved in an argument. The woman applied for and was granted a temporary order of protection. The woman told defendant about the order and showed it to him. Later defendant made repeated attempts to contact her, and walked or stood outside her residence. Police eventually served defendant with the order, and arrested him for its violation. Defendant was charged with violation of an order of protection, stalking, and partner or family member assault. Defendant filed a motion in limine to dismiss the charges. The district court denied the motion and defendant was convicted. On appeal, defendant argued Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-626 was void for vagueness because the statute made it possible to violate an order of protection if the defendant was shown to have knowledge of the order and its content, but failed to provide a definition of the term &quot;knowledge.&quot; The court concluded the word had a commonly understood meaning and did not require a legislative definition. Thus, the statute was not void for vagueness or as it applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the personal representative of deceased's estate, sought a writ of supervisory control directed to respondent, the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County (Montana), which denied petitioner's discovery request in underlying wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a wrongful death action against defendant hospital. Petitioner requested defendant to produce any incident reports or similar reports prepared with regard to any aspect of the care and treatment of decedent while a patient at the hospital. Defendant objected to the discovery request on grounds that such documents were not subject to discovery under statutes providing for confidentiality of information and proceedings of in-hospital medical staff committees, also known as peer review committees. The court vacated respondent trial court's denial of petitioner's motion to compel production of the documents in compliance with petitioner's request. To the extent that documents over which defendant sought protection were relevant to decedent's hospital care and treatment, they were discoverable. However, to the extent the requested documents were in connection with the professional training, supervision, or discipline of defendant's medical staff, they were not discoverable. The court overruled in part its earlier its decision in Sistok v. Kalispell Regional Hospital, 251 Mont. 38, 823 P.2d 251 (1991) pertaining to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-15-332.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, news media organizations, appealed from a judgment of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County (Montana), concluding that coal producer taxpayers had a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding information they provided to the Montana Department of Revenue which exceeded the public's right to know.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tax information coal producers provided to respondent Department of Revenue was routinely made available to the public, however, after respondent adopted Mont. Admin. R. 42.2.701, respondent reduced the amount of tax information it released. Appellants, pursuant to Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9, requested tax summaries, however, respondent, relying on Rule 42.2.701, denied the request. Appellants, arguing Rule 42.2.701 was invalid and unconstitutional, sought a writ of mandate and petition for declaratory judgment. The district court held that respondent adopted Rule 42.2.701 after balancing the public's right to know with the coal producers' right to privacy and found that their reasonable expectation of privacy exceeded the public's right to know. Appellants, arguing that the rule directly conflicted with the state constitution, appealed. Reversing and remanding, the court held that Rule 42.2.701 was unconstitutional on its face because it declared information to be confidential on a wholesale basis for all taxpayers without balancing the taxpayers' right to privacy with the public's right to know.</SPAN></P>

State regulation was unconstitutional on its face because it did not balance the public's right to know with the taxpayers' right to privacy on a case-by-case basis, violating the Montana Constitution. Costs and attorneys' fees were awarded to appellants.</SPAN></P>

Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-20-104(2), -701. The court further held that there was no authority to support defendant's claim that Montana had to civilly revoke his driver's license before he could be cited for driving while the privilege to do so was suspended. Last, the court held that the Drivers License Compact, which applied to convictions in other states, had no application; therefore, any error in the court's finding was harmless and did not constitute grounds for reversal pursuant to Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bankruptcy liquidating trustee in the state of Missouri obtained a judgment against appellant's husband. The trustee registered the judgment with the lower court. The lower court issued a writ of execution upon appellant and her husband's personal property located in Montana. Respondents, sheriff's department, seized the property from appellant's Montana residence. In reviewing the lower court's grant of summary judgment to respondents in action for claim and delivery and for conversion, the court held that tenancy by the entirety, a permissible mode of ownership in Missouri, was not permissible in Montana. Because Montana law was the situs of the property, Montana law applied, and the property was owned by joint tenancy and subject to execution. The court also held that appellant could not maintain an action for claim and delivery to recover property allegedly owned by her sons, because she did not file an affidavit with the sheriff demanding possession as required by state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed summary judgment for respondents on conversion count without comment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to felony assault for accelerating his vehicle toward a police officer who was attempting to stop him. Appellant was ultimately sentenced in January 1994 to prison for ten years for the crime of felony assault and an additional two years, to run consecutively, for the use of a weapon. In May 1999, appellant filed a motion for post judgment relief, contending the additional two years he was sentenced for use of a weapon put him in double jeopardy. The trial court dismissed appellant's motion to amend his sentence due to the running of the five-year statute of limitations for postconviction relief. On appeal, appellant argued the statute of limitations should have been waived because applying it would have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Judgment affirmed. Appellant never made this claim on direct appeal and could not prove he was actually innocent of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the lower court erred by denying his motion to dismiss, arguing that the charge of possession of explosives under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-335 was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and vague, and that he was placed in double jeopardy. The court found the statute clearly applied to appellant's conduct in using a pipe bomb to intentionally destroy a traffic sign. Appellant did not have standing to make a facial challenge to the possession of explosives statute. Appellant's overbreadth challenge failed because he did not meet his burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Appellant's double jeopardy claim was based on the fact that appellee state charged him with three crimes arising out of a single incident, but the court held that appellant was not subjected to multiple prosecutions nor did he receive multiple punishments for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant, convicted of mitigated deliberate homicide, appealed a decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County (Montana), denying the defendant's pre-trial motion to strike the jury panel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant appealed denial of a pre-trial motion to strike the jury panel on the basis that telephone summoning of jurors by the court clerk constituted substantial failure to comply with jury panel selection procedures mandated in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-15-505 (1997) (statute). The plain language of the statute did not permit the clerk to summon jurors by telephone. Failure to summon jurors by mailing or personally serving prospective jurors with written jury summons constituted failure to substantially comply with the statute, and was structural error affecting the essential fairness of the trial. Failure to substantially comply with statutes governing procurement of a trial jury was per se reversible error. To the extent that State v. Robbins, 1998 MT 297, 293 Mont. 23, 971 P.2d 359 (Mont. 1998), required a showing of actual prejudice to sustain a challenge to a jury panel under the substantial compliance standard, the court expressly overruled the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court decision reversed, defendant's conviction vacated, and case remanded for new trial. Court clerk's summoning of prospective jurors by telephone constituted failure to substantially comply with statute mandating mailing or personal service of a written jury summons; structural error affected essential fairness of trial and required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital appealed the order of the District Court of the Seventeenth Judicial District, In and for the County of Valley (Montana) which awarded appellee mandatory attorney's fees pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-915 (1997) in a wrongful discharge case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal had its genesis in a wrongful discharge action by appellee against appellant, her former employer. During negotiations, an offer to arbitrate was made by appellee. Upon appellant's refusal, the matter was tried in the district court. The jury awarded appellee a judgment for $ 44,995.26. After a subsequent evidentiary hearing, the court, determining that appellee was the prevailing party, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-915 (1997), awarded her $ 15,000 in attorney's fees. Under that statute, a party who makes a valid offer to arbitrate that is not accepted by the other party and who prevails in a subsequent judicial action is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees as an element of costs. Judgment was affirmed because appellant failed to comply with the immediate notice requirement of the Mont. R. App. P., Rule 38, precluding the court from reaching the constitutional challenge raised by appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The court held that appellant's failure to comply with the notice requirement of Mont. R. App. P., Rule 38 precluded it from reaching the constitutional challenge. Because appellant raised only a constitutional challenge before the court, its appeal was therefore dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that he was denied due process of law because the trial court considered a computer printout pertaining to a vehicle that was registered in Montana at the time the citations were issued to him. The appellate court declined to consider appellant's constitutional argument because he failed to raise it at the trial court. The appellate court declined to consider his argument under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-20-701(2)(c) because the evidence he complained of was entered into evidence before the initial court and was included in the initial court's filed when the case was transferred to the trial court. Appellant had every opportunity to clarify the document during his trial or to request that the court not consider the document. He failed to do so and waived which claim of error on appeal. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners asked the court declare House Bill (HB) 260 unconstitutional. Petitioners argued that by creating a new tax on the production of coal and then providing a credit against the severance tax, the legislature diverted severance taxes in violation of the constitution. Respondents argued that HB 260 did not violate the constitution because it simply created a license tax. The court held that it had original jurisdiction to entertain the petition because it had an impact on a major segment of the state. Further, the court concluded that the tax created by HB 260 was a coal severance tax because it was imposed on the extraction or production of coal. Finally, the court held that by diverting and allocating the revenue from that tax without a three-fourths vote of each house of the legislature, contrary to Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5, HB 260 violated the Montana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two attorney disciplinary cases were consolidated on common issues concerning the constitutionality of the structure and function of the Montana Commission on Practice. The court held that respondents failed to overcome the presumption of honesty to justify a conclusion that the risk of unfairness from the combination of investigatory and adjudicatory functions in one body was high or that they had been denied their rights to impartial tribunals. The procedures enjoyed by attorneys were as fair, if not more so, than for other professionals because the reviewing panel consisted of 11 versus three persons and commission decisions were subject to the court's de novo review. Respondents failed to establish that the requirements for confidentiality at the investigatory stage, the confidentiality of commission deliberations after the filing of the complaint, or the denial of some discovery requests interfered with respondents' free speech, due process, or other constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Constitutional challenges to attorney disciplinary rules and procedures were rejected because respondents failed to show that combining investigatory and adjudicatory functions in one body violated due process, or that procedures for attorneys were less fair than for other professionals, or that confidentiality provisions violated free speech or other constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly concluded that defendant board was not liable under Mont.
