Code &sect; 40-2A-7(c)(2)(a.), and thus, the taxpayer had two years from the date of the payment of the franchise tax to file a refund petition, but it did not file its franchise-tax-refund petition until well over two years after the payment was made; [3]-The trial court properly denied the taxpayer's second franchise-tax-refund claim because the State Department of Revenue afforded the taxpayer the clear and certain remedy of a refund of the excess franchise taxes it paid, but the taxpayer failed to present evidence to support its claim.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 30-3-4.1, was not facially unconstitutional because there was no risk of inconsistent results from a separate adjudication of appellee grandmother's pending visitation claim; [2]-The GVA was facially unconstitutional, as amended, because Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1(d) let a court award grandparent visitation over a custodial parent's objection by finding such visitation was in the child's best interests, invading a parent's fundamental right to make that decision; [3]-The entire GVA was unconstitutional because Ala.

Code &sect; 11-81-166, a portion of the Kelly Act, codified at &sect; 11-81-160 et seq.; [2]-Because the County had the power to impose the liens regardless of whether any portion was attributable to repayment of indebtedness associated with Kelly Act bonds, the information that the homeowners sought as to the allocation of the charges was not relevant, and summary judgment was properly granted without granting the homeowners' requested discovery.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that Ala. Code &sect; 43-8-48(2)(b) constitutes an exception to the Alabama Uniform Parentage Act (AUPA). Therefore, &sect; 43-8-48(2)(b), rather than the AUPA, governed judicial determinations of paternity for purposes of intestate succession. Consequently, the trial court erred in applying Ala. Code &sect; 26-17-204(a)(5), part of the AUPA, to that determination.</SPAN></P>

The employees were granted summary judgment. A DOC regulation exempting chronic-care inmates from co-pays created a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause. As the inmate alleged he was a chronic-care patient, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether, under DOC's regulations, the co-pays were improperly deducted from his account. Thus, the employees were not entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purposed owners of a diesel truck filed an objection to the proposed sale of the vehicle by a body shop under the Abandoned Motor Vehicle Act (the Act), Ala. Code &sect; 32-13-1 et seq. The Houston Circuit Court (Alabama) found that the vehicle was abandoned and ordered its sale. The purported owners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck, driven by the brother of one of the purported owners, was involved in a collision in Florida. At the direction of the vehicle's insurer, the truck was towed to a dealer in Alabama. Because the dealer could not perform the necessary repair work, it was towed to the body shop. The owner of the body shop spoke about the repairs with the brother, who was the registered owner of the truck. Several months after the brother and the purported owners contested the repair bill and refused to pay, the body shop sought to have the vehicle sold pursuant to the Act to cover the costs of the repairs and storage fees. At the time of the accident, one of the purported owners was making installment payments to the brother on the truck under an agreement to purchase. Thus, the trial court erred in determining that he did not have standing to contest the sale of the vehicle. However, it correctly determined that the other purported owner did not have standing. Moreover, evidence supported the trial court's determination that the vehicle was abandoned pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 32-13-1(1) because it was not called for within 60 days after the owner signed the invoice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendants, the Alabama Department of Corrections and its officers (DOC) appealed the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) that the department violated department regulations by overcharging work-release inmates for certain items and withholding certain fees from the inmates' earnings. The plaintiff inmates appealed the trial court's judgment authorizing the department to withhold certain fees from their earnings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the DOC violated regulations by overcharging work-release inmates for transportation costs and withholding more money than permitted from the gross pay of the inmates' work-release earnings, but that the DOC was authorized to charge work-release inmates for certain goods or services and to charge all inmates a fee for self-initiated medical care and a fee for drug testing conducted by entities other than the department. Because the plaintiffs could not recover damages based on the defense of sovereign immunity, the judgment was properly certified as final. The appellate court held that, because the action challenged the assessment of fees that affected all inmates, all the plaintiffs had standing to pursue the action. The trial court's order that the DOC could only collect 32.5 percent of the work-release earnings was rendered moot by a subsequent amendment of the rules permitting the withholding of 40 percent. The appellate court held that the maximum amount that the DOC could collect from the inmate's gross income was 40 percent because all of the fees were incident to their confinement, but that limit did not apply to other court-ordered withholdings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's findings that the costs of work release were included in the costs of an inmate's confinement and that the DOC could only collect up to 40 percent of an inmate's gross work-release income were affirmed. The appeal and the cross-appeal on a judgment entered regarding an inmate who named only the department were dismissed and the trial court was instructed to dismiss that inmate's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county board of education sought review of a judgment from the Monroe Juvenile Court, Alabama, which reversed the board's finding that 4 students had violated the board's policy on alcohol use at school or school-sponsored events.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal as to 3 of the students who had graduated. For the remaining student, the evidence showed that he showed up to the prom smelling like alcohol. An assistant principal administered a Breathalyzer test, which measure blood alcohol levels of.001 and.006. It was undisputed that the student did not have alcohol in his possession at the prom. The principal suspended him for 5 days for being under the influence of alcohol at prom. The board held a hearing, upheld the suspension, and assigned the student to alternative school for a year. The juvenile court reversed, finding that the word &quot;use&quot; in the board's policy meant to ingest alcohol at school function or on school property. Because the student was not in possession of alcohol, he did not violate the policy, and it ordered him reinstated immediately. The court affirmed, finding that the policy posed the question of whether the student should have known that drinking alcohol before arriving at the prom would constitute alcohol use at a school function, which triggered disciplinary measures. The court found that the policy was unconstitutionally ambiguous and vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against defendants, a warden, prison officials, and the Alabama Department of Corrections, alleging that their acts and omissions violated his constitutional rights. He sought review of a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered judgment in favor of the warden, officials, and Department and dismissed the case with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of civil appeals held that the trial court properly dismissed the inmate's claims against the Department because a state agency, as an arm of the State, was immune from suit in a &sect; 1983 action. Because the inmate's complaint asserted only federal-law claims, the trial court could not have properly granted the warden and officials, who were named in their official capacities, a judgment on the pleadings on the basis of sovereign immunity. However, to the extent the inmate sought monetary damages against the warden and officials in their official capacities, the trial court's judgment in their favor was proper because claims for such relief were barred under &sect; 1983. The trial court had not afforded the inmate the opportunity to rebut the claim of the warden and officials that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the warden and officials upon consideration of the claims asserted in the inmate's complaint and the defenses asserted in the answer. Because the trial court considered only those two pleadings, it could not have possibly considered any response filed by the inmate to the claim of qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of civil appeals affirmed the judgment entered in favor of the Department and the judgment as to any claims asserted against the warden and officials in their official capacities seeking monetary damages. It reversed the judgment as to any claims asserted against the warden and officials in their official capacities and seeking only prospective injunctive relief and as to any claims asserted against them in their individual capacities.</SPAN></P>

The employer moved for summary judgment, arguing that the employee's claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38. The employee challenged an order of the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was the general contractor on a construction job. The employee stepped on a manhole cover while working at the construction site. The cover flipped over, causing the employee to fall into the manhole. He argued that the statute of limitations applicable to wantonness claims was set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-34(1). The court of civil appeals held that the trial court erred when it concluded that the employee's wantonness claim was barred by a two-year statute of limitations. The wantonness claim was governed by the six-year statute of limitations applicable to trespass claims, &sect; 6-2-34(1). A claim of wantonness against a defendant resulting in personal injury to the plaintiff was a claim that the plaintiff was injured by an intentional act or an intentional failure to act on the part of the defendant, rather than by a negligent act or failure to act on the part of the defendant. The intentional nature of the harm caused by the defendant in injuring the plaintiff resulted in the application of the six-year statute of limitations governing trespass claims, rather than the two-year statute of limitations that typically applied to personal-injury claims based in negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of civil appeals reversed the trial court's summary judgment as to the wantonness claim and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property company filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the Etowah Circuit Court (Ala.) to grant its motion to dismiss respondent tenant's appeal of the judgment in favor of the company on its unlawful-detainer complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed a complaint asserting an unlawful-detainer claim against the tenant. After a trial, the district court rendered a judgment in favor of the company. In the judgment, the district court stated that the tenant had until August 4, 2009, to appeal the judgment. The tenant filed a notice of appeal. The company moved to dismiss the appeal, alleging that the notice of appeal had not been timely filed. The appellate court found that Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-6-350 and 35-9A-461 both provide for a seven-day period in which to file a notice of appeal to the circuit court from an unlawful-detainer judgment entered in the district court. Thus, those statutes grant appellate jurisdiction to circuit courts to review an unlawful-detainer judgment only if the notice of appeal is filed within that seven-day period. The application of Ala. R. Civ. P. 6 would extend that period and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to decide appeals when the notice of appeal is filed more than seven days after the judgment was entered. Because such a result would be offensive to the state constitution, Rule 6 was inapplicable to appeals to the circuit court in unlawful-detainer actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court considered whether the circuit court was permitted to award grandparents visitation with their grandchildren over the objection of the children's fit, natural, custodial parents without providing clear and convincing evidence that the denial of such visitation would cause the children substantial harm. Because the trial court awarded visitation to the paternal grandparents without the requisite showing of harm, the trial court unconstitutionally applied the Act to the parents. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was reversed and a judgment was rendered denying the petition of paternal grandparents. Because the paternal grandparents did not dispute that the parents were the fit, natural, custodial parents of the children, the trial court erred in holding that, in order to overcome the presumption in favor of the parents' denial of grandparent visitation, the paternal grandparents had to prove by clear and convincing evidence only that such visitation served the children's best interests.

The college and consortium argued sovereign immunity under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee appealed their dismissals pursuant to the Fair Dismissal Act, Ala. Code &sect; 36-26-115. An administrative law judgment (ALJ) concluded that they had been improperly dismissed. The college and consortium filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the ALJ's order. The employees filed a counterclaim and moved for summary judgment on their counterclaim. The circuit court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari and granted the employees' summary judgment motion. The college and consortium argued that State immunity acted as a jurisdictional bar in the case. The court of civil appeals held that the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the employees' counterclaim. Therefore, that portion of the judgment adjudicating the employees' counterclaim was void. The employees' counterclaim was barred by State immunity. As a state institution of higher learning, the college was absolutely immune from suit under art. 1, &sect; 14. Because the employees' counterclaim was filed against the college and not against any State official in his or her official capacity, the categories of actions that were not barred by &sect; 14 had no application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Department argued that the circuit court erred in finding that the former inmate's right to due process had been violated by the administrative law judge's (ALJ) failure to recuse herself from his case. The appellate court found that under either the actual bias standard or the objective standard focusing on the probability of actual bias, the former inmate failed to establish that his right to due process was violated because the facts of the case, when objectively viewed in light of a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weaknesses, fell short of those facts needed to establish a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that required the ALJ's recusal on due-process grounds. The facts of the case showed that general counsel for the Department, as a matter of course, wrote a letter to the ALJ and requested that the ALJ hear the former inmate's case. Therefore, the former inmate had not established a probability of actual bias that was too high to be constitutionally tolerable. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in reversing the ALJ's order on the ground that her failure to recuse herself violated the former inmate's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

The court of civil appeals held that the trial court lacked a compelling reason to separate the children. The trial court did not state its reason for separating the children. The record did not disclose that either the mother or the father had a difficult relationship with either child or that either parent favored one child to the detriment of the other. The mother failed, pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 28, to support her argument that the trial court erred by failing to determine that the father was due to reimburse her for expenses she had incurred on behalf of the children for their support and maintenance as required by the divorce judgment with a developed argument containing factual analysis of the issue. Her argument was woefully underdeveloped and contained no factual analysis upon which the court of civil appeals could form a conclusion regarding the trial court's determination that the mother was not due any reimbursement from the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of civil appeals reversed the custody judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of a county board of education and the county superintendent of education, challenged a judgment entered for plaintiff board employees in the Washington Circuit Court (Alabama) in the employees' action seeking a writ of mandamus directing them to establish a salary schedule, a declaration that their failure to establish a salary schedule violated Alabama law, and an injunction requiring them to establish a salary schedule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board categorized the employees as support personnel. The court of civil appeals held that the trial court properly applied Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 16-22-13 to 16-22-13.5 when it granted the employees an injunction requiring the board to develop separate salary schedules for each of its categories of support personnel. Sections 16-22-13(a)(2) and 16-22-13.5(a)(2) required that for each job, the board had to provide a schedule that included multiple salary steps. However, the statutes did not provide a basis for the trial court's finding that the steps mandated for the salary schedules for support personnel had to be based on the employee's length of employment. The trial court's attempt to control the board's discretion was barred by the board's entitlement to sovereign immunity under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The employees' action, to the extent it sought to compel the board to create salary schedules that included steps, was barred by sovereign immunity. Although the trial court correctly held that state law required the board to create a salary schedule with steps for each support employee, the board retained the discretion to determine the criteria on which the steps were to be based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of civil appeals affirmed the portion of the judgment holding that Alabama law required the board to create separate salary schedules, each including multiple salary steps, for each category of support personnel and compelling it to establish and maintain such salary schedules. It vacated as beyond the trial court's jurisdiction that portion of the judgment setting forth the criteria on which the mandated salary steps were to be based.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 26-10A-13(b). The birth mother had actual notice of the procedures for withdrawing her consent. The probate court properly found that a friend of the birth mother's family had not acted as an agent for the adoptive parents. The record showed that the adoptive parents saw the friend as a representative of the birth mother and her family and that they did not know the friend until he contacted a family member about the possible adoption. The probate court properly found that it lacked authority under Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-30 to grant visitation rights to the birth mother. If the legislature had intended to allow visitation between a birth mother and a child who was the subject of an adoption-contest proceeding, it could have provided for such visitation. The probate court properly found that small gifts from the adoptive mother to the birth mother were not an attempt by the adoptive parents to influence the birth mother to consent to adoption.</SPAN></P>

XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court found that the father's two children were dependent because they had shared a residence with the father, who had previously pleaded guilty to first-degree rape of his nine-year-old niece. The juvenile court ultimately awarded custody of the children to the mother, and due to the proscription of &sect; 15-20-26(c)(4), the father was ordered not to reside in the same residence with the children. The father was, however, awarded unsupervised visitation with the children. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the juvenile court never heard the constitutional arguments the father made on appeal. Therefore, the juvenile court lacked the ability to determine whether &sect; 15-20-26(c)(4) violated the father's substantive-due-process or equal-protection rights under amend. XIV.

Code &sect; 6-6-220 et seq., which found that the parties' fee agreement did not violate Ala. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5. The firm moved to strike the client's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the Alabama legislature had authorized the Alabama State Bar to create Rule 1.5, and had committed to the State Bar the authority to enforce that rule under Ala. Code &sect; 34-3-43. The State Bar was not made a party to the suit. Thus, the determination as to whether the fee agreement violated Rule 1.5 was not binding on the State Bar. The State Bar was free to interpret and enforce Rule 1.5 with regard to the fee agreement without regard to the trial court's judgment, and without regard to any disposition by the appellate court of the appeal. Thus, the judgment was merely advisory. The case presented a dispute that was not justiciable and for which any judgment constituted merely an advisory opinion, so the trial court never obtained subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The judgment was void, and could not support an appeal. The motion to strike the client's brief was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed claims with the Alabama Department of Revenue for refunds under the Alabama Taxpayers' Bill of Rights (TBOR), Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-1 et seq. When some of the claims were denied, the taxpayer appealed to the Administrative Law Division, which determined that the taxpayer was entitled to refunds. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) ruled that the Division did not have jurisdiction to grant the refunds. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, in its petitions with the Department, either requested a refund of a franchise tax on the basis of unconstitutionality or on the basis of an alternative apportionment theory. The taxpayer did not request from the Department a refund of the franchise tax based on a removal of any and all pushdown accounting procedures. The Division on review under Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-7(c)(3) determined that the taxpayer was entitled to a tax refund on a pushdown accounting basis. On appeal, the court found that the Division exceeded its statutory authority under Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-9 in ordering the Department to grant the taxpayer's refund request based on the pushdown accounting basis. That particular refund claim was not initially raised with the Department in a petition for refund as was required by the TBOR, and the allowance of such a claim at the appellate level completely abrogated the two-tiered administrative review process outlined in the TBOR and resulted in the circumvention of the TBOR's periods of limitation for filing such claims. The Department was the state agency designated by Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-7(c)(1) as the proper entity to first address the taxpayer's refund claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was affirmed. The Department's motion to strike certain appendices in the taxpayer's brief was denied on the ground that it was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the denial of death benefits to the dependents, who were nonresident alien dependents of a deceased employee, was not unconstitutional. Since the dependents were not citizens of nor resident aliens in the United States, they were not entitled to invoke constitutional guaranties on their own behalf. Aliens only received constitutional protections when they came within the territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country. The majority of the cases upheld the power of state legislatures to distinguish between resident alien beneficiaries and nonresident alien beneficiaries. The rights of the dependents to death benefits under the Act were separate from the rights of the employee, rather than derivative of the employee's rights. Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-82 did not implicate any constitutional rights of the dependents. To the extent that that statute barred the dependents from having a valid claim to benefits under the Act upon the employee's death, the statute acted in a sphere that was not occupied by the due-process and equal-protection guaranties of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class representative's suit alleged a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 40-7-60 et seq.--specifically that annual property appraisals did not reflect fair and reasonable market value as required by Ala. Code &sect; 40-7-62. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) denied a motion to dismiss filed by the Department of Revenue's acting commissioner. A new acting commissioner timely filed a petition for a writ of mandamus challenging the denial of the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a motion for rehearing. Because Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 barred a claim against the State for a refund of overpaid ad valorem taxes and for attorney's fees and costs, it was error to deny the motion to dismiss that claim. Although the declaratory judgment count impermissibly sought damages in the form of a refund based on a retroactive application of the representative's interpretation of the statutes, to the extent that she sought a determination of the correct valuation method to be applied presently and in the future, that part of the claim was not barred by &sect; 14 sovereign immunity. The constitutional claim, that the commissioner's interpretation of the valuation statutes rendered them unconstitutional as applied to the representative, fell within the declaratory-judgment exception to sovereign immunity. A judgment in favor of the representative on that claim would not result in a recovery of damages or funds from the State treasury, and the parties would have to comply with the trial court's order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband had sought to terminate his alimony obligation as he was soon to lose his employment and the wife had begun cohabiting with another woman in a lesbian relationship. The wife admitted to the relationship but testified that she had not worked full-time since 1995 and was currently enrolled part-time in college in an effort to obtain a teaching certificate. The wife occasionally worked as a substitute teacher. After the trial court entered an order stating that the alimony would terminate if the wife cohabited in an illegal relationship with a member of the same sex, the wife's girlfriend moved out. After a hearing, the periodic alimony obligation was reinstated. On appeal, the court affirmed. Based on the plain language of Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-55, periodic alimony could be terminated only if the wife were living openly or cohabiting with a member of the opposite sex. Despite the state policy against homosexual conduct and same-sex marriage espoused in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-65 and Ala. Code &sect; 30-1-19, the power to award alimony was purely statutory; the court could not assume the role of the legislature and expand &sect; 30-2-55 to cover cohabitation with a member of the same sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their adoption petition, the stepfather and the mother alleged that the father had not complied with the PFRA. The father asserted that he had not been notified of the adoption petition, and because the stepfather and the mother had failed to notify the probate court of the juvenile court's prior custody orders, it was deprived of the opportunity to conduct a hearing to fully investigate whether the adoption served the best interests of the child. The appellate court held that the judgment from which the father appealed was void because the father had asserted that he was a &quot;presumed father.&quot; He attested that he and the mother had executed affidavits of paternity pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-17-5(a)(6). He also averred that he had accepted the child into his home and openly held out the child as his own as required by Ala. Code &sect; 26-17-5(a)(4). The record contained no evidence indicating that the father waived his right to notice of the adoption, notwithstanding his noncompliance with the PFRA. Because the probate court did not notify the father of the pendency of the adoption proceeding, it judgment was void and would not support an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological father had not given his consent to the adoption. The appellate court affirmed. The Adoption Code, Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-7(a)(3)(d), provided that the consent of a &quot;presumed father&quot; of a child, i.e., any male person as defined in the Alabama Uniform Parentage Act (AUPA), Ala. Code &sect; 26-17-1 et seq., was necessary in a proceeding to adopt the child if the presumed father had received the adoptee into his home and had openly held out the adoptee as his own child. In the instant case, the father had not only prosecuted a paternity action under the AUPA to a final judgment that had declared him to be the father of the child, he had also been awarded and has exercised visitation rights at his home and at the home of his parents and had paid child support under the auspices of that paternity judgment and subsequent modifications thereto. Thus, by its terms, the Adoption Code plainly required that the father consent to the adoption of the child and that requirement was not obviated by the father's failure to comply with Ala. Code &sect; 26-10C-1 by registering as the child's putative father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city and the Alabama Department of Revenue challenged an administrative law judge's decision that ordered a refund of a portion of the use taxes that a computer manufacturer had paid under Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-62(1). The Marshall Circuit Court (Alabama) concluded that the Department could apply the amendment to &sect; 40-23-62(1) retroactively to collect taxes from the manufacturer and reinstated penalties. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department argued that the retroactivity provision in 1997 Ala. Acts 97-301, &sect; 3, and Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-7(b)(2)(a) permitted it to assess use taxes due under &sect; 40-23-62(1) back to 1990 because the manufacturer and its predecessor never filed use tax reports with the Department. The retroactivity provision made the amendment of &sect; 40-23-62(1) retroactive to May 1994, i.e., three years before 1997 Ala. Acts 97-301 became law. Thus, from May 1994 through May 1997, the manufacturer was require to file use tax reports on purchases from out-of-state vendors upon which no sales tax had been paid. The manufacturer's failure to do so permitted the Department to assess taxes for those years because the reports were not filed as required under &sect; 40-2A-7(b)(2)(a). However, the tax years before May 1994 were not reopened by the retroactivity provision. As applied to the manufacturer, the retroactivity provision was constitutional because under prior case law, a reach of three years was modest. The penalties under Ala. Code &sect; 42-2A-11(a) and (c) were inappropriate as the manufacturer's failure to file use tax returns was reasonable cause under Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-11(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The Department and city were allowed to assess use taxes against the manufacturer for the period between May 1994 and December 1997. The penalties could not be collected as they were waived for reasonable cause. The case was remanded with instructions to the Department to properly compute the use taxes due and to refund, if necessary, any additional amounts the manufacturer had paid pursuant to the original assessments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment in a divorce case that awarded appellant mother and appellee father joint legal custody of their minor child. It also awarded physical custody of the child to the mother provided that she relocate to Alabama to a distance within 60 miles of the child's previous Alabama address. The mother appealed the territorial restriction imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father married, and later moved to Alabama. The child was then born in Alabama. The parties' relationship soon became strained. Eventually, the mother left the marital residence with the child and sought shelter at her parents' home in Illinois. She then filed for divorce in Alabama. The father, a pilot, visited the child in Illinois when possible. The trial court divorced the parties, awarded the parties' joint legal custody of the child, and awarded the mother physical custody of the child provided she relocate to Alabama. That condition was based on the trial court's finding that the best interests of the child required residence in Alabama to facilitate custody, schedule the child's activities, and because of the quality of the local schools. The appellate court found that the territorial restriction, that the mother live within 60 miles of the child's last address in Alabama rather than reside with the child in Illinois, did not impermissibly infringe on her right to travel secured by U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment. It so concluded because it found that the best interest of the child took precedent over the parent's right to travel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney filed a breach of contract action against a city board of education and recovered damages. The board challenged an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court, Bessemer Division (Alabama), which granted the attorney's petition for a writ of mandamus, directing the board to pay him the amount owed on the judgment, plus interest. The board argued that it was entitled to immunity under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney alleged that when the board terminated its attorney-client relationship with him it failed to pay him for his legal services. The trial court entered summary judgment in his favor on his breach of contract claim against the board. The court of appeals held that the board failed to demonstrate that it was not bound by the judgment awarding the attorney damages. The board was not immune from suit as to the attorney's claim for breach of contract. City boards of education were legislatively granted the authority to contract under Ala. Code &sect; 16-11-12, and they could sue and be sued on those contracts. Section 14 did not prohibit the trial court from exercising its authority, via a writ of mandamus, to compel the board to perform its legal duty or to perform ministerial acts. Based upon the affirmance of the judgment entered in favor of the attorney by the court of appeals and the supreme court's subsequent denial of the board's petition for a writ of certiorari as to that affirmance, the board had a clear legal duty to pay the judgment, and the attorney could seek to compel the performance of that duty via a petition for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery County Department of Human Resources (County DHR) and the Alabama Department of Human Resources (State DHR) filed a petition for a writ of mandamus requiring the Montgomery Juvenile Court (Alabama) to vacate its orders directing that a girl in the legal custody of the County DHR be placed in the National Deaf Academy (NDA), that the State pay the girl's expenses at the NDA, and that the girl's therapist be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The girl was deaf and mentally challenged and was adjudicated dependent. The County DHR was granted legal custody of the girl. The State DHR notified the juvenile court of the County DHR's intent to change the girl's placement from the NDA to a children's residential service. The appellate court held that the State DHR established its right to a writ of mandamus directing the juvenile court to vacate its order requiring the State to pay the expense of placing the girl at the NDA. The Alabama Juvenile Justice Act, Ala. Code &sect; 12-15-10, mandated that the county, not the State, was responsible for the cost of the girl's care. The County and State DHR did not establish their right to a writ of mandamus directing the juvenile court to vacate its orders requiring that the girl be placed at the NDA and that her therapist be reinstated. The juvenile court's order did not fail to allow the State DHR to carry out its legislative mandate. Instead, it reviewed the girl's progress under the transfer plan that had been implemented, determined that the transfer plan was not serving her best interests, and returned the parties to the previous plan, which all parties acknowledged had been working.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Health Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA) and its Certificate of Need Review Board (CONRB) challenged a judgment of the Walker Circuit Court (Alabama), which reversed the CONRB's denial of a hospice's application for a certificate of need to operate an inpatient hospice facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the hospice filed its application, the governor issued an executive order, placing a moratorium on the consideration of CON applications relating to hospice services. The order was amended to exempt applications requested at the time it was issued. The circuit court found that the CONRB violated SHPDS'a rules and regulations by relying on the executive order and by accepting the testimony of the executive director of the Alabama Hospice Organization, who had not intervened or requested permission to be heard. The appellate court held that the CONRB's decision was made in compliance with the applicable law, was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and was supported by substantial evidence. Because the moratorium was not applicable to the hospice's application, the circuit court could not properly reverse the CONRB's decision on that basis. The moratorium was not at issue when the CONRB conducted the hearing. In its decision, the CONRB detailed the reasons for denying the application, and it did not rely upon the director's comments. The decision was based on the hospice's inability to convince the CONRB of the financial and medical necessity and feasibility of the proposed facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) issued a stay of the order revoking a doctor's medical license, the Medical Licensure Commission of Alabama (Commission) petitioned the instant court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the circuit court to vacate that order, as the doctor failed to establish any of the grounds set out in the applicable statute governing the stay of an order revoking a medical license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission argued that the circuit court erred by applying the wrong standard in issuing the stay. The instant court agreed. The statutory standard for issuing a stay of a medical-license revocation was not whether the physician's continued practice would endanger the public health, safety, or welfare, but whether a reviewing court, upon proof by the party seeking judicial review, found in writing that the action of the licensure commission was taken without statutory authority, was arbitrary or capricious, or constituted a gross abuse of discretion. And, while the doctor's evidence centered on the former, it failed to satisfy the latter standard. Second, the instant court disagreed that the absence of a transcript of the revocation hearing made it impossible for the doctor to obtain a stay. Finally, the governmental interest to be furthered, specifically, the risk of error in the determination whether to grant or deny a stay, and the interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens far outweighed the doctor's right to practice medicine, weighed heavily in favor of the state. Hence, the doctor's due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found that the mother made a decision that visitation should be reinstituted with the paternal grandmother after the paternal grandmother filed an action for visitation, and the mother testified that she intended to continue that visitation in the future. The trial court's judgment indicated that the trial court did not presume those decisions regarding visitation to be in the child's best interest, as required by the United States Constitution. Instead, the trial court made an independent decision that, because the mother had terminated the paternal grandmother's visitation in the past, visitation should be compelled pursuant to the grandparent-visitation statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1. Because the trial court made an independent decision regarding what visitation with the paternal grandmother would be in the child's best interest, instead of presuming that the mother's decision regarding that issue was in the child's best interest, the appeals court concluded that the trial court's judgment unduly infringed upon the mother's due-process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Alabama Department of Revenue assessed additional income tax against appellant multistate corporation under Ala. Code &sect; 40-18-35(b). Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-7(b)(5)(b), the corporation appealed to the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied the Department's' motion for partial summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the corporation. The Department and its commissioner appealed pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 12-3-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Ala. Code &sect; 40-18-35(b), expenses and costs related to intangibles, such as royalties paid to a related member (IMCO), were subject to tax as part of a corporation's income. The appellate court found that the trial court focused on the first part of the &sect; 40-18-35(b)(3) exception in finding that the application of &sect; 40-18-35(b) was unreasonable. Interpreting the unreasonableness exception of &sect; 40-18-35(b)(2) in that manner nullified the effect of the &sect; 40-18-35(b)(3) exception by eliminating the need for that exception. The appellate court held that the subject-to-tax exception applied on a post-apportionment basis and that the Department's claim, that it could apply the apportionment factor to that part of royalty payments that was not subject to taxation in another state as part of the IMCOs' taxable income in that state, was consistent with the requirement of a nexus between Alabama and the royalty payments. There was no showing that the tax resulting from an application of &sect; 40-18-35(b) was out of proportion to the corporation's activities in Alabama or that the tax reached beyond that portion of value that was fairly attributable to economic activity in Alabama.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-6-231. After the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) denied the Board and members' motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, they petitioned for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractors sought preliminary and permanent injunctions precluding the Board from enforcing its advertising rules, and a judgment declaring that those rules were unconstitutional.

I, &sect; 14, barred the chiropractors' claims insofar as they sought an award of attorney fees and costs. However, art. I, &sect; 14, did not bar their claims insofar as they sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-10 authorized such an action if the &quot;threatened application&quot; of an administrative rule threatened to interfere with or impair a plaintiff's legal rights or privileges. As the Board's advertising rules threatened to interfere with the chiropractors' rights or privileges, even though they had not yet been disciplined under those rules, they had standing to challenge those rules under &sect; 41-22-10. The Board and members' contentions that they were entitled to other types of immunity, and that the chiropractors' claims had no merit, were not cognizable in a petition for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court applauded the mother's attempts to free herself from drug addiction and her efforts to stabilize her life. However, because the juvenile court's factual findings were presumed to be correct, the appeals court could not say that the juvenile court's judgment determining that the child was dependent was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The evidence regarding the family's history showed several of the factors listed in Ala. Code &sect; 26-18-7 of the 1984 Child Protection Act, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-18-1 to 26-18-11. Because the juvenile court had the responsibility and the opportunity to observe the witnesses, its decision that the father's mother was not a viable alternative for placement of the child was presumed to be correct. Regarding the mother's sister, the evidence showed that although she was contacted several times, she never showed a willingness to care for the child and did not testify at the termination hearing. Because the determination that the child was dependent and that there were not viable alternatives for placement was supported by clear and convincing evidence, the judgment terminating the mother's parental rights to the child was proper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the grandmother indicated that she would protect the children from any harm, including harm from the mother, but she did not detect any signs of the child abuse for which the mother was convicted (even though she later admitted that the signs of physical trauma were obvious). Further, the grandmother failed to direct her oldest daughter to prevent the mother from obtaining custody when the grandmother was hospitalized. While the grandmother had moved into a new house and her leg wound had healed, the children were removed from the grandmother's home after she had allowed the mother to regain custody. The grandmother indicated that she trusted the mother and that she believed the mother had substantially changed the behavior that led to the removal of the children. Thus, the grandmother still lacked adequate judgment to protect the children from the mother and the potential harm arising from their interaction. Transferring custody of the children to the grandmother was not a viable alternative to termination of the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Department of Revenue entered a final sales tax assessment against a taxpayer. The taxpayer appealed, asserting that Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-4(a)(11), which exempted sales to Alabama government entities, but not sales to government entities of other states, violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The Colbert Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the taxpayer summary judgment; the Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sold products to Alabama and Mississippi governmental entities without collecting or paying sales taxes. It argued that Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-4(a)(11)'s exemption for Alabama governmental entities violated the Commerce Clause as there was no analogous exemption for out-of-state governmental entities. In prior litigation over the same issue, the state's highest court had ruled in favor of the taxpayer, finding that the Department had provided no evidentiary justification that &sect; 40-23-4(a)(11) advanced a legitimate local purpose that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. In the instant case, the taxpayer argued that the Department's assessment of sales taxes for subsequent years under &sect; 40-23-4(a)(11) was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The Department argued that the doctrine did not apply, as different tax years were involved in the two cases, and that it presented sufficient evidence in the instant case to show that the tax scheme was justifiable. The appellate court held that collateral estoppel barred relitigation because the controlling facts and applicable legal rules remained the same as in the prior litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The taxpayer's request for damages pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 38 was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father appealed the award of visitation to the grandparents under the Act. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional on its face for failing to expressly include a presumption in favor of a parent's visitation decisions because the implied presumption that the parent's wishes are in the child's best interests is as much a feature of the statute as its plain language. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutionally applied to the father based on the fact that it allowed the grandparents to petition for greater visitation rights than the father was already voluntarily providing. The court held that the circuit court did not indicate that it gave any greater weight to the father's determination than it did the other factors it considered, did not explicitly recognize that the father's decision was presumed to be in the best interests of the child, and improperly used a simple best-interests analysis to reach its own independent decision as to the mode of visitation that best served the interests of the child; therefore, the court reversed the visitation award, which unduly infringed on the father's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 12-19-270 et seq., and directing the entry of a final judgment as to the adjudication of the customer's claims (case two). The Alabama Supreme Court transferred the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer alleged that the owner made false statements to third parties indicating that he had had sexual intercourse with a masseuse, and that he had fathered a child with her. The intermediate court held that the trial court granted the owner's summary judgment motion, but did not expressly rule on the counterclaim. Although the silence of that judgment was usually interpreted as an implicit denial of the counterclaim, the owner timely filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment. The postjudgment motion was granted, the judgment as to the counterclaim was vacated, and a final judgment was entered as to the customer's claims. Thus, jurisdiction was properly reserved for the adjudication of the counterclaim. The slander per se claim failed as the customer conceded that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-181 had been ruled unconstitutional. The slander per quod claim failed as the customer did not quantify any special damages, and did not show that his heart attack was caused by the owner's statements. The summary judgment on the invasion of privacy claim was reversed as the customer alleged an intrusion upon seclusion claim, but the owner disputed the claim based on a false light claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city appealed from the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) concluding that the city was subject to the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act, Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-1 et seq., and awarding workers' compensation benefits to a city employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the city argued that it was not subject to the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act, that the city was entitled to a setoff of workers' compensation benefits for extraordinary disability payments made to the employee, and that attorney's fees should not have been awarded to the employee's attorney. The appellate court held that pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-13(b), the city was subject to the Worker's Compensation Act, because the city had a population of more than 250,000 as of the most recent decennial federal census. The appellate court held that the plain language of Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-57(c)(1) indicated that it was intended to prevent an employer from paying duplicate benefits to the employee for the same disability. To prevent such a duplicate payment, the city was entitled to a proportionate credit equal to the rate of its contribution to the extraordinary disability payments made to the employee. The appellate court held that the city lacked standing to challenge the award of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insofar as the city appealed the award of attorney's fees, the appeal was dismissed.

The judgment was reversed insofar as it denied a setoff of workers' compensation for extraordinary disability payments. The case was remanded for the trial court to apply a setoff.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed. First, the individual failed to point to any evidence that supported his alleged common-law marriage. Second, the record failed to disclose any alleged legally protectable interest the individual might have in the land other than his plan to reside on the land with his mother's permission. Third, the record contained no evidence indicating that the CNA impeded the individual's job opportunities. Finally, he failed to present sufficient evidence indicating that the residency requirements of the CNA had a punitive effect on him. Moreover, because the CNA did not impose a punishment against him in violation of the Ex Post Fact Clause, said clause was not violated. Further, as the CNA could not be considered a punitive statute in either intention or effect, enforcement of its residency requirements against the individual could not be classified as a violation of his constitutional right against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the Marion Circuit Court (Alabama), entered a new visitation judgment that afforded the maternal grandparents substantially less in terms of guaranteed visitation with the children at issue than its prior judgment. The childrens' father (father) appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the trial court correctly afforded the grandparents substantially less in terms of guaranteed visitation than its original judgment. The instant court first rejected the father's claim that the visitation schedule was unreasonable, as the trial court substantially reduced a visitation award that would have resulted in the children traveling back and forth across Alabama once every two weekends and every Easter and Mother's Day, as well as requiring them to spend six weeks away from home each summer and one week each winter and spring academic break. Limiting the grandparents to in-person visitation of 14 days in the summer and 11 days during fall and spring school terms, apart from visitation approved by the father, seemed to be well within reason and within the meaning of the original decision. Moreover, the trial court properly applied Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1(d) in accounting for the pertinent factors specified by the Alabama Legislature, especially the wishes of a living parent such as the father. Finally, the court did not completely disregard the wishes, in contravention of Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1(d)(6), regarding the location of the visitation ordered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Houston Circuit Court (Alabama) denied a buyer's postjudgment motion after the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama) granted judgment in the seller's favor on the seller's fraud claim, and on the buyer's counterclaims, assessing compensatory damages in the amount of $ 12,699.18 and punitive damages in the amount of $ 25,000. The buyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer challenged the judgments entered, contending that the trial court erred by: (1) finding that he made a false representation to the seller about the condition of his trade-in vehicle; (2) finding that the seller had reasonably relied on any representation the buyer made; (3) awarding punitive damages; and (4) considering whether the case had been settled before trial. The appeals court found no error. First, the evidence supported a finding that the buyer had knowledge of the water damage to his trade-in vehicle, concealed such to the seller, and that a document evidencing the original sale of that vehicle stated that the vehicle had sustained water damage. And, reliance was shown based on evidence from the seller that it would not have taken the vehicle as a trade-in had it known of said damage. Second, punitive damages were warranted, based on the expressed findings that the buyer committed intentional fraud, and the buyer failed to establish error regarding said award. Finally, the trial judge did not violate Ala. R. Evid. 408 or Ala. Code &sect; 34-3-21 in recalling the procedural history of the case and mentioning the previous settlement negotiations between the parties.</SPAN></P>

The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) affirmed. The massage therapist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges were based on a report filed with the state board by an investigator, an adult female who received massages from the massage therapist. The investigator testified that the massage therapist touched her breast, nipples, buttocks, and genitalia during a massage. An earlier consent order stated that the massage therapist's &quot;professional activities&quot; would be &quot;monitored&quot; by the state board. The appellate court found that Ala. Admin. Code r. 532-X-3-.04(7) was broad enough and gave the state board authority to &quot;monitor&quot; the massage therapist by hiring the investigator to receive massages from him. The massage therapist did not establish that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in conducting typical business with the public at his massage-therapy establishment. Accordingly, the investigator's receiving a massage from the massage therapist did not constitute a Fourth Amendment search. The massage therapist's counsel had a full opportunity to cross-examine the investigator when she testified at an earlier hearing, and there was no authority for the contention that his due-process rights were violated by the investigator's failure to testify at a subsequent hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held the father's motion to re-open the prior determination was barred by res judicata. The appellate court held res judicata did not apply because, when the trial court denied the father's motion for scientific testing, it did not reach the merits of his claim that such testing would disprove his paternity. The trial court never conducted a crucial inquiry into whether the paternity judgment should be set aside based on scientific evidence. It could not have conducted this inquiry because it did not have any scientific evidence before it to justify reopening the case for a consideration of the merits. The only evidence then presented was a genetic-testing report stating on its face that it could not be used as legal evidence of parentage or identity. The trial court's denial of the motion for scientific testing was not a decision on whether the case should be reopened, much less a conclusive determination as to whether the prior paternity order should be set aside. The father stated a valid claim for relief under Ala. Code &sect; 26-17A-1 that was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners appealed a remanded judgment by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of a city; the owners invoked the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws as the basis of their claim that because a city had not consistently enforced a special exception requirement for day care centers, the zoning ordinance could not lawfully be applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Supreme Court reversed a judgment, and remanded the cause for further review of the owners' equal protection claim. The appellate court found that the city's zoning board had, in fact, considered and acted upon special-exception petitions in the past. There was also evidence that the city had strictly enforced the special-exception provisions of the ordinance. Consequently, the trial court could properly have concluded that public outcry against the day-care business operated on the owners' property, not an intentionally practiced pattern of discrimination on the part of the city, was responsible for the city's decision to strictly enforce its zoning ordinance, both in the owners' case and prospectively. Therefore, the trial court properly entered judgment in the city's favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In cases consolidated for appeal, plaintiff corporation sought various relief against, among others, defendants, a city and a zoning board, arising from the denial of the corporation's applications for permits to construct billboards. The Lauderdale Circuit Court (Alabama) granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the zoning board. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that 1971 Ala. Acts 2135, which granted the city the power to zone in an area outside its corporate limits, was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that, because the expansion did not affect the manner in which the zoning power was to be exercised, the territorial expansion of the limits within which the city could exercise that power did not violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104(18). Nothing in 1971 Ala. Acts 2135 purported to affect the city's actual power to zone. The need addressed by 1971 Ala. Acts 2135 was not addressed by the general law and the act was not unconstitutional under Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105. Because the corporation could and did appeal the denial of the billboard permit the corporation sought from the city, and even though that appeal was untimely, mandamus did not lie to compel the city to grant that permit. The corporation's brief failed to make any argument in support of the appeal of the summary judgment related to the appeal of the affirmance of the denial of the various billboard permits. The only arguments raised by the corporation were those addressed in conjunction with the declaratory-judgment/mandamus appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation filed suit against a department of revenue, appealing a final assessment, seeking a judgment declaring that the business privilege tax (BPT) and the corporate shares tax (CST) deduction schemes violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and requesting a refund of taxes paid. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered judgment in favor of the department. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation asserted that the BPT and CST deduction schemes facially discriminated against interstate commerce and that the department failed to meet its burden to offer a justification for the deduction schemes. The appellate court found that the statutory scheme allowed a deduction from the CST and the BPT based on where the entity in which the taxpaying corporation invested did business, i.e., in state or out of state. This encouraged, to an extent, domestic corporations to invest in entities that did business in Alabama, at the expense of entities that did not do business in Alabama. On their face, the statutes at issue, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 40-14A-23(g)(1), 40-14A-33(b)(2), imposed a heavier tax burden if the entity in which the taxpaying corporation had invested did not do business in Alabama. Thus, the statutes were discriminatory on their face. Since the BPT and the CST deduction schemes were facially discriminatory against interstate commerce, they were &quot;virtually per se invalid,&quot; and the department had the burden of demonstrating their validity. The trial court erred in placing the burden on the corporation to overcome the presumption that the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) modified its prior judgment granting a moratorium as to the performance of duties by the Association of Regional Councils (ARC), precluding the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) from requiring that statements of consistency be filed with applications for future solid waste disposal sites during the moratorium. ADEM appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the instant appeal, ADEM argued that ARC's suit against them did not present a justiciable controversy. After a review of the record, the appeals court agreed. In sum, the suit by ARC anticipated a controversy, with adversaries not a party to the suit, that might result from its performance of its member commissions' statutorily mandated duties. ARC did not seek to compel ADEM to take any action, nor did it claim that ADEM was threatening the regional commissions with a lawsuit. Second, ARC argued that ADEM was the local government's virtual representative; hence, the case presented a justiciable controversy and the judgment could bind non-parties, such as a county. However, the appeals court disagreed as nothing demonstrated that ADEM was in privity with the hypothetical adversaries in the case. Finally, ARC did not seek to declare its statutory duties unconstitutional, nor did it seek an order compelling ADEM to perform any particular task or duty. Instead, it wanted to avoid the risk of liability in the event its performance of statutory duties upset someone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed, and the moratorium imposed by the trial court was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama) denied death benefits to the worker's dependents. The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was survived by a wife and minor children, who lived in Mexico. They were not named as defendants. The trial court held that under Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-82, the dependents were not eligible for death benefits because they were not residents of the United States. The administrator challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court stated that under Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-60, workers' compensation death benefits, and the right to bring an action for their recovery, belonged solely to the dependents of a deceased worker. Here, the carrier had alleged that the worker was survived by the dependents, and the trial court had considered and rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-82. It was only the dependents, not the worker's estate, who would have benefited if the challenge to the statute's constitutionality had been successful. Thus, the dependents were necessary parties to the lawsuit under Ala. R. Civ. P. 19. The court could not, however, determine on the record whether it was feasible to join the dependents in the lawsuit. On remand, the trial court was to develop the information and make a finding as to the feasibility of joinder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stepmother was married to the daughter's biological father from 1987 until the father died in 2004. The stepmother petitioned to adopt the daughter. The daughter obtained the age of majority two days after the petition was filed. The daughter filed a written consent to the adoption pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;26-10A-6. The court held that it was error to allow the adoption because at the time the daughter was not a &quot;stepchild by marriage&quot; as contemplated by Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-6(2)c. The stepmother-stepchild relationship was one that was created through the marriage of the daughter's biological father to the stepmother. Once the marriage ended because of the father's death the affinity that had established the relationship between the stepmother and the daughter was extinguished. The court declined to impute a contrary legal intent that Ala. Code &sect; 2-10A-6 was meant to allow for adoptions between a stepparent and a stepchild when the relationship between the stepparent and stepchild was severed by reason of the death of the biological parent.</SPAN></P>

The Jefferson Circuit Court, Alabama, upheld the Board's order, and the licensees appealed. They claimed that the Board did not have sufficient guidelines in place, that its secretary improperly filled multiple roles, and that the Board had relied on computer printouts that were hearsay evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees were suspended for dispensing such substances without prescriptions and for related reasons. They were later found to have violated the suspension order, in that they had dispensed drugs and obtained payments from third parties while on suspension. The 30-year suspension was then imposed and upheld. Affirming, the reviewing court ruled that the Board had complied with the minimum notice requirements of the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, &sect; 41-22-1 et seq., in instituting the suspension process. The Board gave notice of the charges and other pertinent information. The court also ruled that the Board had complied with Ala. Code &sect; 34-23-33 (1975) in finding the facts by a preponderance of the evidence, so that the proceedings were not vague or indefinite. Given the duties of the Board's secretary under Ala. Code &sect; 34- 23-91 (1975), the court saw no error in allowing the secretary to sign the suspension order, as it was the Board that had rendered the decision. The court also concluded that even if the secretary had investigated the charges, there was no indication that he also took part in the adjudication, and combining the two roles was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion Circuit Court (Alabama) granted a petition filed by appellee maternal grandparents to allow visitation between them and their grandchildren, children of appellant father. The grandparents were also awarded reasonable telephone contact with the children. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged the judgment entered, raising seven issues. Of those issues, four were not raised in the trial court, and were thus pretermitted. The remaining issues each concerned the propriety of the visitation award. As to the first of those issues, the father's constitutional challenge to Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1 was not properly presented for review, as he did not serve a copy of his answer upon the Attorney General. His second challenge squarely presented for review whether &sect; 30-3-4.1, as amended, required a showing of harm as a prerequisite for a judgment awarding grandparental visitation. The court held that it did not. The trial court's decision to award definite visitation to the grandparents, given the factual background leading up to that court's judgment, was wholly consistent with the letter and spirit of &sect; 30-3-4.1. But, the trial court abused its discretion in requiring the father to travel 600 miles round trip once every two weeks for a single day of visitation with the grandparents, not to mention requiring the children to spend substantial amounts of time with their grandparents during each academic-vacation period, including six weeks during the summer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the judgment regarding the terms and amount of visitation awarded, was reversed, due to the extensive travel requirements placed upon the father. Hence, the matter was remanded on this issue. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The homeowners sought a declaration that the city could not deny them the right to operate such a home and injunctive relief. Their summary judgment motion on their declaratory and injunctive relief claims was denied, and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A homeowner was not told to get a special exception to the zoning ordinance to run a home day care. The appellate court held the homeowners had constructive notice of the ordinance, so the city was not equitably estopped from enforcing it, and it required an exception. A business license issued to the homeowner did not mean a day-care business could be run in her home, as it was general permission to run a business in the city and not specific permission to run a business at a certain place. A zoning-enforcement officer's statements that the homeowner could run a business at her home on getting fire-department clearance did not equitably estop the city from requiring a special exception, as these represented law and not fact. Absent fact representations the homeowners could reasonably rely on as to the need for a special exception, acts furthering a plan to run the business were unavailing. The homeowners did not serve their complaint on the attorney general, so they could not contest the ordinance's constitutionality. The city did not have to track statutory definitions of day care centers in its zoning ordinance, and the attorney general found a special exception was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) dismissed claims filed by appellant taxpayer against appellee, the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Revenue, in his official capacity, which sought refunds of franchise taxes it paid for the tax years 1994 through 1997 and a declaration that it was entitled to those refunds. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the judgment entered, contending that the class-action tolling rule tolled the statute of limitations for filing petitions for refunds with the Alabama Department of Revenue pursuant to the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TBOR), Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-1 et seq.. But, it failed to cite any legal authority holding that the filing of a class action would toll a statute of limitations for instituting an administrative proceeding when the members of the putative class knew or should have known that the administrative proceeding constituted the exclusive method of obtaining the relief they sought. Because a reasonable taxpayer would know that the TBOR constituted the exclusive remedy for obtaining a refund of franchise taxes, the State of Alabama had not held out a class action as being available as a remedy for obtaining a franchise-tax refund. Therefore, the taxpayer's argument lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a divorce action against defendant father in the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama). Appellee paternal grandparents intervened in the divorce action to seek grandparent visitation under Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1 (amended 2003). The trial court granted visitation rights to the paternal grandparents. The mother appealed the grant of visitation rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents had a volatile relationship. The father broke into the mother's home, raped her, and attempted to kill her. The father subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges arising from his actions. At that time, the relationship between the mother and the paternal grandparents began to deteriorate. Despite having hired investigators to follow the mother, the paternal grandmother explained that she was not contending that the mother was not properly rearing the child, but said that the child should have been given the opportunity to know her paternal grandparents. On appeal, the court decided the case under the version of Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1 that existed at the time the paternal grandparents intervened and under the caselaw that interpreted that version of the statute. The court found that no evidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, indicated that the child had suffered harm in the months that she was denied the chance to see her paternal grandparents. Instead, the testimony of the guardian ad litem indicated that the child was happy and well-cared for in the mother's custody. Thus, the paternal grandparents failed to show they were entitled to visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as it awarded the grandparents visitation, and the cause was remanded for the entry of a judgment consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and the Alabama Environmental Management Commission appealed from a judgment entered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which at the request of an environmental group (EG), declared invalid the water-quality regulations promulgated by ADEM at Ala. Admin. Code r. 335-6-10-.12. ADEM and the Commission also appealed from a subsequent order entered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a summary judgment for the EG. The appellate court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to vacate its previous judgment and to enter a new judgment for the EG. The regulation was not invalid due to a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 22-22A-8(a). The rule's reference in its definition of &quot;Tier 1&quot; waters to the &sect;&nbsp;303(d) (33 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1313(d)) list was proper. The Commission did not adopt the &sect;&nbsp;303(d) list, but included waters appearing on it within the &quot;Tier 1&quot; classification. The Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-1 et seq., and the Alabama Environmental Management Act, Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;22-22A-1 et seq., did not bar the proposal or the adoption of rules that referred to the &sect;&nbsp;303(d) list. A change in the &sect; 303(d) list did not ipso facto amend the regulation. The 110 percent rule was rationally related to the goals of preventing federal preemption of state control of water resources and of establishing definite limits as to environmental cost burdens upon permit applicants. Finally, the references to economic-developmental and social-developmental necessity withstood a void for vagueness challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) entered an order in which it, among other things, granted the State's motion for a summary judgment, denied appellant corporation's motion for a summary judgment, and ordered that gaming devices and $ 2,841 in currency be forfeited. The corporation timely appealed. The case was transferred to the court by the state supreme court pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 12-2-7(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation &quot;supplied&quot; gaming machines to two gaming establishments from which the machines were seized. The appeals court found the corporation had not asserted any evidence indicating that it had any ownership interest or possessory interest in either of the gaming establishments from which the property and currency was seized. Therefore, it failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that it had standing to challenge the search of the gaming establishments. The corporation argued that on May 3, 2001--the date on which the gaming machines were seized--it did not have &quot;fair warning&quot; that the gaming machines would later, through the issuance of the opinion in Ex parte Ted's Game Enterprises, be determined to violate the criminal gambling statutes and, therefore, that those machines would be subject to civil forfeiture. However, given the timing of the release of the supreme court's Opinion of the Justices No. 373 advisory opinion, the appeals court rejected the corporation's argument that it did not have fair warning that its machines might violate Alabama's criminal gambling statutes and, therefore, that they would be subject to forfeiture pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), appealed from a judgment entered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) awarding plaintiffs, a town and a landowner, approximately $ 338,618 as interim attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and the landowner disputed the awarding of a permit by the ADEM to a limited liability company to operate a solid-waste landfill. The ADEM claimed the award of attorney fees against it was prohibited by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 (1901). The appeals court found that the fee award, which would be paid from the state treasury and not from funds that were improperly collected, resulted in the type of direct affect on the financial status of the state treasury that was prohibited by &sect; 14. Although cited by the trial court in support of its judgment, the appeals court could not conclude that Brown v. State (Brown I and II) had any controlling precedential impact. Having reviewed the supreme court's opinion in Brown I, as well as the opinion in Brown II and other pre- and post-Brown decisions, the appeals court concluded that no supreme court decision stood as precedent for the proposition that the language of &sect; 14 served to protect the state treasury any differently from an award of attorney fees than from an award of money damages. Qualitatively, the effect on the treasury -- and the implication for the State's immunity -- would be the same in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment awarding attorney fees against the ADEM was reversed, and the cause was remanded for the entry of a judgment consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the Department satisfied the supreme court's directive in Hoover I, to justify the different treatment of in-state and out-of-state governmental entities. In sum, the Department imposed a sales tax on sales of products by the taxpayer to all in-state and out-of-state entities equally. The only exception was for sales to the State itself and to its political subdivisions. Further, the Department logically and reasonably argued that it should not be required to incur administrative costs merely to collect from itself and from its political subdivisions moneys that, if left untaxed, would remain directly available to fund governmental functions. Finally, if the taxpayer's position prevailed, the collected funds would only be available to fund governmental functions after the State incurred the administrative cost to collect those moneys and then return them to itself and to the other governmental entities from which the moneys came. However, no support was cited to require such to satisfy the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Alabama transferred to the court an appeal by plaintiff automobile insurer from a denial of summary judgment of the Geneva Circuit Court (Alabama) in a declaratory judgment action regarding coverage for defendant insured, arising from an incident in which the insured drove into defendant homeowner's house while fleeing police. The insurer argued that the trial court should have applied a policy exclusion for criminal acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was being chased by police when he ran into the homeowner's trailer. The homeowner and her insurer sought to recover from the insured and his insurer. The insured's policy included an exclusion for damages caused by criminal acts of the insured. The court held that such an exclusion did not violate Alabama public policy. The wording of Ala. Code &sect; 32-7A-4, which described the extent of mandatory coverage, made it clear that the legislature envisioned circumstances in which there would be no coverage. Since an absence of coverage was a possibility, even under a compulsory insurance law, the trial court should have been cautious about finding public policy violations in the policy exclusion. In a homeowners' insurance context, Alabama case law had already recognized the enforceability of exclusions for criminal acts, and accordingly, the insurer was within its rights in inserting the provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order denying summary judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings in accordance with its ruling that summary judgment in the insurer's favor was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unemancipated minor sought review of the trial court's (Alabama) decision denying her petition for a waiver of parental consent to have an abortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was 17 and approximately 8 weeks pregnant. She testified that she would reach the age of 18 shortly after she entered her second trimester of pregnancy, but that having the abortion procedure at that time could increase her risk of having complications. The minor sought a waiver of parental consent pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-21-4(f) of the Parental Consent Act, Ala. Code &sect; 26-21-1 et seq. The trial court found the minor was well informed concerning the abortion process and its consequences, but was not sufficiently mature. The appeals court found none of the facts set out by the trial court supported a finding that the minor was insufficiently mature. She was almost 18, made good grades and participated in extracurricular activities, had plans to attend college, and wanted to have a career in the medical profession. She testified that the method of birth control that she and her boyfriend had chosen failed. The appeals court held that the trial court was plainly and palpably wrong in determining that the minor was not sufficiently mature and that having an abortion would not be in her best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying the waiver was reversed and the case was remanded. Because of the importance of time, the trial court was directed to enter a judgment granting the waiver, not later than 12:00 noon, January 6, 2005. If the trial court did not enter a judgment granting the waiver by that time, then effective at 12:01 p.m. on that date a judgment granting the statutory waiver would be rendered by the appeals court.</SPAN></P>

The father testified that visitation disputes, neglect, and a concern for the child's safety, as well as the mother's lesbian relationship, were the reasons he filed the petition. The mother made it difficult for the father to exercise his visitation rights. The child was left unsupervised and her whereabouts were not always known when she was in the mother's custody. The father was properly awarded custody. The maternal grandfather's visitation rights were reversed as he was a step-parent and was not a &quot;grandparent&quot; under Ala.

The father's postjudgment motion was denied by operation of law. The father also moved to strike the custodian's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The custodian argued that the child had lived with her for about 13 years. The appellate court held that the custodian had standing to bring a dependency petition. The trial court could award visitation to the custodian after making a dependency determination if the trial court found such an award to be in the child's best interests. Although the custodian did not expressly request visitation, the child asked that he be allowed to visit the custodian as often as possible. The visitation award served the child's best interests. The evidence supported the finding that the child was dependent. The child had not been in the physical custody of either parent for 13 years and was in the physical custody of a non-relative during that time until the father removed him. The child was suffering emotionally due to his change of environment without any transitional period. The child had formed a strong emotional bond with the custodian and wanted to continue to live with her. The father did not allow the child to contact the custodian and the child often cried when he called the custodian after sneaking out of the father's home.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Alabama State Department of Human Resources (DHR) and its Commissioner, the Calhoun County Department of Human Resources (County DHR) and its board members, the Alabama State Personnel Department and its director (Department), petitioned for a writ of mandamus ordering the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) to vacate its denial of defendants' motion to dismiss a suit filed by plaintiff former director of the County DHR (Director).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit alleged that the director was improperly transferred her to a new position. Defendants argued that the suit was barred due to their sovereign immunity. The appellate court held that defendants' motion for an interlocutory appeal was properly denied as Ala. R. App. P. 5(a) applied only to suits within the original jurisdiction of the Alabama Supreme Court. The new Commissioner was properly substituted as a party to the action under Ala. R. Civ. P. 25. The State's absolute sovereign immunity extended to its arms and agencies, including the DHR, the County DHR, and Department. However, as the suit sought a declaration that the state officers acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and in a discriminatory manner in transferring the director's employment and that that transfer did not comply with the Alabama Merit System Act and the administrative regulations adopted pursuant to the Act, the claims against the state officers in their official capacities were not barred by Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted to the extent that it sought a writ directing the trial court to dismiss the DHR, the County DHR, and the Department. In all other respects, the petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee parents had entered into a settlement of their custody dispute, the Crenshaw Circuit Court (Alabama) granted appellant paternal grandparents' motion to intervene, but denied the grandparents' request for grandparent visitation. The grandparents appealed from an amended order entered in response to a new trial motion that was essentially the same order that had been entered previously. The orders were certified as a final judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the appeal was untimely. The appellate court held that the settlement agreement between the parents had not been reduced to a judgment and, therefore, the appeal was timely. The trial court erred in finding that it could not order the grandparents visitation rights under Alabama law. However, that error did not mean that the grandparents were automatically entitled to court-ordered visitation. Although the grandparents had been deeply involved in the child's life, there was not sufficient evidence to justify the state's interference with the father's fundamental right to make decisions regarding the care, custody, and control of the child. The grandparents had attempted to disrupt the father's ability to carry out his responsibilities as a parent, as evidenced by the grandfather's striking the father and the incidents of the grandmother's interference with day care and taking the child for a haircut against the father's wishes. Further, the father admitted that it was in the child's best interests that he be allowed to visit with his grandparents and stated that he would continue to allow the visitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the grandparents' request for court-ordered visitation rights was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The instant matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought relief, specifically contending that mandamus relief was appropriate based on: (1) sovereign immunity; (2) insufficient notice; (3) failure to pay interest on the amount of the final assessment; and (4) the class-action remedy sought in the taxpayer's trial court complaint. The appeals court first concluded that the portion of the complaint which sought a tax refund through a class action suit for declaratory judgment and petition for refund of taxes, whether filed individually or by a class of similarly situated taxpayers, was barred by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. Second, while the taxpayer made its payment of the taxes stated on the Department's final assessment under protest, which would make its declaratory-judgment action one to determine the disposition of funds held in escrow, it was not reasonable for the taxpayer to rely on the procedures originally provided with the Department's final assessment, and initiate an appeal pursuant to those procedures. It should have followed the statutory procedures set out in Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-9(g)(1). When it did not do so, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Because no transcript of that testimony or authorized substitute therefor was contained in the record, the appeals court was left to conclude that the trial court's judgment was supported by the ore tenus testimony.

He also claimed that it violated his due process rights. The appellate court held that the Alabama Constitution did not contain an express equal protection provision. The alleged father's argument was not based on any of the constitutional provisions that had historically been held to form the basis of a right to equal protection.

Also, in the citizen's notice of appeal, he summarized the issue on appeal as a question of the constitutionality of Ala. Code Ann. &sect; 36-27-4(d) (1975). Upon reviewing the record on appeal, the appellate court found nothing indicating that the citizen served the attorney general with a copy of his complaint for declaratory relief. Accordingly, it concluded that the attorney general was not properly served with notice of the citizen's constitutional challenge and that the trial court had no jurisdiction to rule on his complaint for declaratory relief. Because the attorney general was not served, the trial court's judgment was void and would not support an appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision to grant the petition. The parents were unable or unwilling to serve as fit custodians for the child, and reunification for purposes of a normal parent-child custodial arrangement was not &quot;foreseeable.&quot; DHR made reasonable efforts to rehabilitate both parents, but was unsuccessful, because of the mother's mental deficiencies and poor decision-making skills and the father's failure to complete parenting-skills classes or consistently visit his child. No information was presented about two persons whose names were presented as possible placement alternatives, such as whether they had ever visited the child or had any relationship with the child. There was no showing that either person would be a fit custodian, let alone that such a placement would be in the child's best interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a motion in the Marshall Circuit Court (Alabama), for a new trial, or, alternatively, to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment concerning visitation of the parties' children. The circuit court amended the judgment to limit visitation to the father only and to permit the paternal grandfather to pick up the children on behalf of the father. The court also found the father was in arrears in his child support. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father joined the armed services and moved to Washington, his visitation rights became unworkable. The paternal grandfather lived in Florida, near the mother and children. The mother objected to the father's reworked visitation rights and claimed that he was in arrears in his child support payments. On appeal, the court found that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting the father to utilize only the aid of the paternal grandparent to facilitate visitation. Further, the father did not forfeit any of his fundamental parental rights when he divorced, or when he joined the armed services. Therefore, the father retained the right to allow other suitable family members to visit with his children during his visitation periods, even when he was unable to be present. Additionally, the father could visit his stepson. Moreover, the trial court was presented substantial evidence from which it could determine that the father was in arrears in his child support payments.

The Jefferson County District Court (Alabama) awarded possession to the authority, and the tenant appealed. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) required the tenant to pay rent to the court while the case was on appeal, and ordered money which the tenant paid to the court paid to the authority after the appeal was dismissed. The tenant appealed that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A housing authority received information that a tenant engaged in criminal activity in her apartment, and it filed an action in district court, seeking possession of the apartment. Although the tenant denied the allegation, the district court awarded possession of the apartment to the authority. The tenant appealed the district court's judgment to the circuit court, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-351 (1975) (amended 1996), and the circuit court issued an order requiring the tenant to pay her rent to the circuit court while the case was on appeal. Over a year later, the circuit court dismissed the appeal and awarded amounts the tenant paid to the circuit court to the housing authority. In the tenant's appeal from the circuit court's order awarding money she paid to the court to the housing authority, the court of civil appeals held that (1) &sect; 6-6-351 was constitutional; (2) the circuit court correctly required the tenant to make her rent payments to the circuit court while the tenant's appeal was pending; and (3) the circuit court also properly awarded the funds accumulated by the court to the housing authority after the tenant's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that the seller sold the owner's shares in a massage school to the purchaser without the owner's consent. The seller and the purchaser acted pro se. The purchaser sought a new trial on the ground that she was not allowed to speak on her own behalf while proceeding in the first trial pro se. The owner argued that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the new trial, as there was nothing to show that the purchaser was denied the right to speak on her behalf. The appellate court held that the record failed to show any instance where the trial court prevented the purchaser from taking an active role in presenting her own defense. The purchaser did not object to the trial court's treatment of the seller as representing the seller and the purchaser, and affirmatively agreed that the seller could act on both their behalf. Moreover, the purchaser did not object to any of the trial court's references to &quot;the defense&quot; or &quot;the defendants&quot; as being a single unit, with the seller as its representative. Thus, the purchaser did not demonstrate any error as to warrant a new trial and the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee gaming distributor, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged the distributor placed gaming machines violating the state's criminal gambling statutes,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-20 to 13A-12-76. The appellate court held the State's appeal was timely, as it did not have to appeal from a judgment determining less than all claims. The State was a &quot;person,&quot; which could sue under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-220 et seq., and its success on its forfeiture claim against the distributor did not prohibit its appeal of the adverse declaratory judgment. The State's claims were not barred by res judicata as previous cases were in rem actions for the forfeiture of machines, rather than a declaratory judgment action as to the proper application of gambling-related statutes, and those claims were not barred by collateral estoppel because the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-76 was not previously litigated, and collateral estoppel did not apply to pure questions of law. Section 13A-12-76 could not, without contravening Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 65, be construed or applied to legalize games or activities in which skill did not predominate over chance in determining the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was an exempt wholesale generator. The appellate court held that the company bore none of the usual characteristics of a utility. The company was not obligated to serve the public, it had no power of eminent domain, it was not subject to regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, and its rates were not established by either the Alabama Public Service Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Department emphasized the fact that the company generated electricity and asserted that it came within the term &quot;electric light or power company,&quot; under Ala. Code &sect; 40-21-1. The Department argued that, because the company's property was centrally assessed under &sect; 40-21-1, it became a &quot;utility&quot; for the purposes of classification and assessment under Ala. Code &sect; 40-8-1. The appellate court held that the Department failed to demonstrate that the company had such characteristics of a utility as would make it reasonable to classify its property as Class I property for ad valorem tax purposes. The circuit court properly set aside the Department's classification and assessment of the company's property as Class I property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the father summary judgment on the claims against him. The jury found for the daughter on the husband's claims and for the wife on her claims. The trial court denied the parties postjudgment motions. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were changing lanes in a vehicle as they approached a restaurant drive.

The daughter alleged that the husband failed to turn off his right turn signal and that she assumed he was going to turn. The daughter pulled out into traffic and a collision occurred. On appeal, the court found that: (1) it simply could not say that the wife established in her brief on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding a medical doctor's testimony; (2) because the evidence in the record regarding the wife's medical damages was disputed, the wife did not demonstrate that the jury's damages award was inadequate; (3) given the evidence in the record and the clear language of Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-114 (1975), the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in denying the husband's motion for a judgment as a matter of law on the issue of contributory negligence.</SPAN></P>

He gave permission to search the vehicle. The officer found three cases of beer. Because the county was dry, the deputy seized the vehicle pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-93. The appellate court held that the correct statute for a seizure based on the transportation of beer into a dry county was Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 28-4-286 through -290.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Houston Circuit Court, Alabama, declined to enforce or modify appellant grandparents' visitation judgment, holding that it had no jurisdiction to modify another state's judgment or to entertain a new suit in reference to grandparental visitation under Alabama law. The appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents challenged the judgment against them. The court of appeals held that proper disposition did not turn on whether Alabama's grandparent-visitation statute was unconstitutional, either per se or as applied. The Kentucky court's determination as to visitation was a final judgment that had to be recognized and enforced by Alabama courts. The fact that the circuit court had jurisdiction to modify the grandparents' visitation rights as the mother requested did not mean that it had jurisdiction to redetermine, ab initio, whether the grandparents should have been granted visitation rights. The previous visitation judgment remained a custody determination. The circuit court had the task of exercising its discretion to determine whether to modify the visitation rights granted. It could decide, consistent with Alabama law, that such a material change in circumstances occurred that modification or termination of visitation was warranted in the best interests of the child, just as it could in cases not involving a foreign judgment. But, the trial court's jurisdiction to modify future visitation could not be equated with the power to undo the Kentucky court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Lowndes Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment declaring appellant town's ordinance prohibiting landfills in certain locations to be invalid and unconstitutional. The state environmental agency, solid-waste business, and town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The solid-waste disposal business proposed to operate a solid-waste facility. The appellee county then adopted a resolution granting &quot;host-government&quot; approval. Thereafter, the town enacted an ordinance prohibiting landfills within its corporate city limits and police jurisdiction. The solid-waste disposal business then applied for a solid-waste permit to operate its landfill. The town and appellant adjoining property owner sought to revoke the permit on the ground it was not properly issued. The trial court stayed the proceedings. The state environmental agency and the solid-waste disposal business appealed the stay. However, the trial court then lifted the stay, and the appellate court found the appeals of the stay were moot. The county and the solid-waste disposal business also sued to have the town's ordinance declared void and unconstitutional. The town argued the county's resolution was invalid and filed a counterclaim. The trial court found the ordinance invalid, and the counterclaim time-barred. After the town appealed, the appellate court found the ordinance was invalid, as it conflicted with related state law, and the counterclaim was statutorily time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals of the state environmental agency and solid-waste disposal business were dismissed. Also, the judgment against the town was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that the owner's issues were not preserved, as well as that the trial court's judgment was legally correct. The appeals court held that the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying the owner's motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the State's failure to promptly institute the forfeiture action. The appeals court noted that the State did not demonstrate it had the requisite intention of having process served within a reasonable time after filing its forfeiture complaint. The appeals court also noted that the owner's appeal did not fail for lack of preservation, as the trial court's adverse ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings served as a basis for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' vehicles collided when a tortfeasor did not yield the right of way to the injured parties. The appellate court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding an injured party's expert evidence as to the cost of future surgery because this testimony did not consider what medical service providers would charge Medicare for the surgery. As this evidence of future medical costs was excluded, and other evidence of the injured party's damages was disputed, the jury's damages award was not inadequate. The trial court erroneously denied the other injured party's motion for judgment as a matter of law that he was not contributorily negligent, as the evidence showed a tortfeasor did not yield the right of way to him because she &quot;assumed&quot; he was going to turn.  Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-114, requiring her to yield the right of way, had no exception for situations in which she made assumptions about actions the injured party would take. It was not error for the trial court to grant the tortfeasors' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the injured parties' wantonness claim, as they presented no evidence to support it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of an injured party's motion for judgment as a matter of law that he was not contributorily negligent was reversed, and the matter was remanded for trial on his claims against the tortfeasor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a final judgment of divorce which relinquished the parental rights of the father to the minor child, appellee grandparents filed a petition to intervene seeking grandparent visitation pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1 (1975). The Etowah Circuit Court, Alabama, granted the grandparents visitation. The trial court denied appellant mother's motion for a new trial from which she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the grandparents did not meet the statutory definition of &quot;grandparent&quot; in Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1(a), and that the action had been filed during the same year that another custody action regarding the child as to whom visitation was sought had been adjudicated in contravention of Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1(e). The appellate court held that by the terms of the statute, the grandparents did not fall within any of the definitions of Ala. Code &sect; 30-3- 4.1(a), because they were not the parents of a parent of a minor child when they filed their petition. Their son's parental rights had been terminated in the final divorce judgment. Thus, the grandparents lost their standing as &quot;grandparents&quot; to petition under the statute. They were not parents of the father whose parental rights had been terminated when the child had been adopted pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-27 et seq. (1975). Because the grandparents never sought to intervene while the divorce action was pending, their attempt to intervene was untimely and should have been denied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 30-3-4.1 (1975). Respondent father moved to dismiss, claiming the statute was unconstitutional. The State defended the statute, but the trial court declared it unconstitutional and denied the request for visitation. The grandmother sought a new trial, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother alleged that since her daughter's death, her visitation with the minor children had been sporadic and limited, but she had no intention to hinder the parent/child relationship. The father alleged that there was no constitutional basis on which to interfere with the family unit, that the statute was unconstitutional, and that the State could not infringe on the fundamental rights of parents to make child-rearing decisions. The State argued the statute was constitutional. The trial court concluded that the statute failed to provide any standard by which a court could determine whether and under what circumstances to award visitation. The trial court record reflected that the State did not expressly consent to an extension of time to rule on the grandmother's new trial motion. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that the new trial motion was denied by operation of law 90 days after the filing of the postjudgment motion, and that it had jurisdiction because the appeal was from a final judgment. Based on a recent case holding with substantially the same posture, the appellate court determined that the trial court erred in holding the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although a majority of the court of appeals previously determined in a different case that the rebuttable presumption in favor of grandparent visitation contained in Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1 (1975) was unconstitutional, the court of appeals concluded in the instant case that the remainder of the statute was enforceable because it provided a standard -- the factors listed in &sect; 30-3-4.1(d) -- upon which a trial court could rely in determining when and under what circumstances to award visitation. In addition, the requirement that the trial courts consider &quot;other relevant factors&quot; under &sect; 30-3-4.1(d)(6) allowed the trial courts to construe the Alabama's grandparent-visitation statute so as to encompass necessary constitutional requirements. The court of appeals held that &sect; 30-3-4.1 could be given a field of operation within constitutionally imposed limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Houston Circuit Court, Alabama, granted judgment in favor of appellee mother by declining to enforce or modify appellant grandparents' visitation judgment, stating it had no jurisdiction to modify another state's judgment or entertain a new suit in reference to grandparent visitation under Alabama law. The grandparents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Alabama's Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), specifically Ala. Code &sect; 30-3B-102(3), judgments providing for child visitation were child-custody determination that had to be recognized and enforced by Alabama courts if the other state's court exercised jurisdiction in conformity with the UCCJEA. The effect of the Kentucky court's judgment awarding grandparent-visitation rights under the Kentucky statute was to decide the entitlement of the grandparents to visitation. The parents did not raise constitutional objections to the award of visitation to the grandparents and their failure to do so prevented them from reviving their foregone rights to raise objections. The Alabama circuit court could decide, consistent with Alabama law, that such a material change in circumstances had occurred that a prospective modification or termination of visitation was warranted in the best interests of the child, just as it could in cases not involving a foreign judgment. The trial court did not have the power to undo the Kentucky court's judgment by again considering the constitutionality of the original court-ordered grandparental visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandfather and the children's step-grandmother petitioned for grandparental visitation after the parents asserted the step-grandmother was not a proper person to have visitation with the children. The trial court granted the parents' summary judgment motion as to the step-grandmother but granted the grandfather visitation. Under the circumstances, the state's interest in enabling grandparent visitation was not compelling, and had to yield to the parents' fundamental liberty interest in determining the children's unsupervised visitation with the grandfather. The trial court's finding that the children's visitation with the grandfather was in their best interests was not sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the parents' contrary decision. The rebuttable presumption in Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1(e) in favor of grandparent visitation was unconstitutional. Even if there had been no such presumption and the grandfather had the burden of proving the children's best interests, the grandfather's showing was not sufficient to overcome the parents' fundamental liberty interest in making decisions regarding the care, custody, and control of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant testified her requests to speak to a physician concerning the abortion procedure were denied. She did not indicate a knowledge of any long-term psychological effects of the procedure. The trial court was authorized to grant appellant's petition under Ala. Code &sect; 26-21-4(f) (1975) if it found she was mature and well-informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own, or performance of the abortion would be in her best interests. The evidence before the trial court showed appellant was not sufficiently well informed to make the abortion decision on her own, since she had not been allowed to speak to a physician. The trial court evidence did not indicate appellant's parents would react inappropriately to the news of her pregnancy or that their input would not be in her best interests. The trial court's decision denying appellant's petition did not err. The ore tenus rule did not apply when the facts were undisputed, and the appellate court determined whether the trial court misapplied the law to the undisputed facts. The appellate court suggested the ore tenus rule might apply in an action where a minor sought waiver of parental consent for an abortion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed because the evidence presented did not indicate the statutory requirements for granting a waiver of parental consent to a minor's abortion had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought to visit the child under Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-30, which permitted grandparents to visit a child. Defendants argued the statute did not apply because plaintiffs did not qualify as natural grandparents under &sect; 26-10A-30, because defendants had adopted their granddaughter, who was the child's mother. Plaintiffs were really great-grandparents. The appellate court found that, under Alabama law, plaintiffs were treated as natural grandparents of the child and had standing to ask for visitation. However, &sect; 26-10A-30, as applied, was unconstitutional, because it infringed upon defendants' fundamental right to parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trial court granted respondents' petition for grandparent visitation, petitioner filed a motion under Ala.

The appellate court, after the filing of the petition for writ of mandamus, stayed the trial court's order, pending further orders of court. The trial court did not rule on petitioner's Rule 59 motion within 90 days of its filing, so, pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 59.1, absent the consent of the parties for the trial court to retain jurisdiction over the motion, which was not given, the motion was denied by operation of law. Therefore, to the extent the mandamus petition sought extension of the trial court's stay until determination of petitioner's Rule 59 motion, the question was moot. To the extent petitioner sought an extension of the trial court's stay pending adjudication of an appeal, such relief could be sought under Ala. R. App. P. 8(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of mandamus was denied because it was partially moot, given the trial court's denial of petitioner's motion in the trial court, and other relief was available in the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery (Alabama) Circuit Court denied plaintiffs' claims seeking a refund of state superfund contributions, and use of superfund moneys to pay for hazardous waste cleanup, respectively, under the Alabama Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Act, Ala. Code &sect; 22-35-1 et seq. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were service station owners. The first plaintiff contended that he did not want to participate in the trust fund set up under the Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Act (USTA), Ala. Code &sect; 22-35-1 et seq. The second plaintiff sought payment from the trust fund for the required cleanup of contamination on his property. Plaintiffs sued defendant state department of revenue, arguing that the funding mechanisms of the USTA violated Ala. Const. amend. 354, which prohibited use of fuel taxes for anything other than highway projects. The trial court ruled in favor of defendant. The court affirmed, holding that demonstration of financial responsibility for cleanups was mandatory, but that neither federal law nor state law mandated a particular mechanism by which an owner or operator of a storage tank must satisfy the requirement. Plaintiffs' voluntarily participating in the USTA, instead of relying on another mechanism, prevented the fee they paid from being one &quot;levied by the state,&quot; as contemplated by amend. 354.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment affirmed. Plaintiffs voluntarily participated in the trust fund act, instead of relying on another of the available mechanisms to satisfy the federal financial-responsibility requirements. Therefore first plaintiff had no right to a refund of monies paid to the fund, and second plaintiff had no absolute right to payment from the trust fund.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's legitimation proceeding, filed in a separate county from the adoption proceedings and which failed to include appellees or the child, did not substitute for appellant's failure to comply with the Act, which, because appellant was an unwed father, was his sole method for claiming paternity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lived in subsidized housing controlled by appellee housing authority. Appellee sought to terminate appellant's tenancy after appellant allegedly violated her lease by allowing a person whose name appeared on a banned or no trespassing list into her apartment. The court below, upon a jury verdict, entered judgment in favor of appellee. Appellant argued on appeal that appellee failed to give adequate notice that the person's name had been placed on the banned list. Appellant did not dispute that she knew that the person had been on the banned list in the past. The person testified in the court below that when that ban expired, he showed appellant documentation indicating that his name was no longer on the banned list. He also testified that when his name was placed back on the banned list, he did not tell appellant. The court found that there was no evidence that appellee had notified appellant that the person had been placed back on the banned list. The court found that the judgment of the court below in favor of appellee was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the verdict was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The termination of appellant's public housing tenancy by the court below was reversed and the cause was remanded because the evidence did not support the finding that appellant had notice that a person whom she allowed into her apartment had been placed on appellee housing authority's banned list.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of a decision holding that appellee, employer, was entitled to set off her workers'-compensation benefits from her disability-retirement benefits. The court affirmed the judgment and found that absent her disability, appellant would not have been entitled to receive disability-retirement benefits from the employer, and that under these circumstances appellee was entitled to a set-off. The court rejected appellant's contention that appellee had impermissibly been allowed to set off its workers'-compensation obligation against &quot;regular,&quot; as opposed to &quot;disability,&quot; retirement benefits because appellant, due to her injury, was able to immediately draw the same monthly pension she would have received upon reaching the age of 65 if she had voluntarily stopped working, and her immediate receipt of these benefits would not have prevented her from continuing to receive them after she attained normal retirement age. Finally, the court rejected each of appellant's constitutional challenges to Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-57(c)(1), and appellant's contention that rejecting her contentions that the courts of Alabama were without jurisdiction to decide the setoff issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of education voted to reject educational funds available through Goals 2000. Plaintiff filed an action to permanently enjoin defendant from denying the public school system the opportunity to apply for Goals 2000 federal funds.

Defendant then moved for summary judgment and plaintiff moved for attorney fees. Summary judgment was entered for defendant, but plaintiff's motion for attorney fees was granted. Defendant sought review, contending that plaintiff was not the prevailing party and therefore not entitled to an attorney fee, and contending that defendant had legislative immunity. Judgment was affirmed because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the lawsuit succeeded in bringing about the desired result of the defendant's acceptance of the funds, and legislative immunity was not applicable to its actions.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 68 unconstitutional, and defendant cross-appealed alleging that costs were improperly taxed under rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a negligence action involving an automobile accident, plaintiffs prevailed after trial but damages were awarded in an amount less than the amount previously offered by defendant and declined by plaintiffs. Costs were taxed to defendant because plaintiffs were the prevailing party except that, pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 68, plaintiffs were required to pay certain costs incurred by defendant after the offer of judgment. The appellate court first held that the record on appeal concerning plaintiffs' motion to declare Ala. R. Civ. P. 68 unconstitutional was insufficient to evaluate the constitutional issue and thus the issue was not addressed. Further, defendant was entitled to recover costs incurred as necessary expenses in defending the action after the offer, including charges for obtaining records and a copy of a deposition, and plaintiffs' recovery of costs was limited to costs incurred by plaintiffs prior to the offer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part because the record was insufficient to permit consideration of the constitutionality of the rule concerning taxing costs after plaintiffs' refusal of defendant's offer of judgment, but reversed in part to permit defendant to recover expenses incurred in defending the action after refusal of such offer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adult sought a declaration that defendant putative father was his father and that defendant had owed a duty of support to him during his minority, and sought a retroactive monetary support award. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant on all claims. The issue on appeal was whether plaintiff's action was barred by either the statute of limitations or defendant's execution of a will disinheriting plaintiff. The court held no statute of limitations prevented plaintiff from obtaining a judicial declaration of paternity because plaintiff had no presumed father under the Alabama Uniform Parentage Act. However, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-17-8 prevented him from recovering the retroactive child support; thus, the trial court erred in granting defendant summary judgment as to plaintiff's request for a judicial declaration that defendant was his father. Additionally, defendant's execution of a will, in and of itself, did not defeat plaintiff's inheritance rights.</SPAN></P>
