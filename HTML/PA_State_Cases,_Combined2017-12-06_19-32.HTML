Laws 47 (Act 47), including 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8305, because even if Act 47 contained more than one subject in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, the substantially belated nature of parents' challenge, which arose 22 years after its enactment, rendered the legislation immune to attack on that basis; [2]-Where reliance on the law continued for more than 20 years, a presumption naturally arose that any process challenge was too stale to be cognizable regardless of whether the challengers exercised reasonable diligence; [3]-Invalidating all of the provisions retroactive to 1988 would be unduly disruptive to the orderly administration of justice in Pennsylvania, and doing so would cause greater harm to the public weal than the alleged constitutional transgression itself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The denial of the inmate's claims under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546 (PCRA), was proper because there were no grounds to disturb the PCRA court's decision to credit a psychiatrist's testimony to the effect that his post-trial characterization of the inmate as suffering from schizophrenia was a mistake. That decision was supported by the record, and as such, the supreme court was bound by it. Accordingly, the psychiatrist's now-disavowed out-of-court statements could not form the basis of a meritorious constitutional claim; [2]-The inmate failed to prove that counsel was ineffective because counsel used reasonable professional skill and subjected the psychiatrist to meaningful adversarial testing.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 3 because the fact it amended 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 101 - 9913 did not satisfy Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, subjects of refining civil remedies or relief and judicial remedies and sanctions were too broad, and provisions on deficiency judgment procedures, asbestos statutes of limitations, county police jurisdiction, and sexual offender registration requirements did not act together as a unifying scheme to accomplish one purpose; [2]-Megan's Law provisions could not be severed because all Act 152's provisions were equally void, so one did not offend the Constitution more than another.</SPAN></P>

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court assumed plenary jurisdiction, under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 726, and petitioners filed an application for relief, requesting the appointment of a special master.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners wanted a master to hear evidence. The supreme court held evidence of demographic changes was unnecessary because it did not affect the issue, since further constitutional amendment should account for such changes. Evidence the retirement mandate was irrational was unnecessary because that conclusion had been rejected. Evidence on voters' understanding when voting for a judge was irrelevant because (1) they were deemed to know terms of judges who had to retire would expire early, (2) their contrary understanding did not support their claim, as an uninformed vote counted, and no ballot deficiency showed unconstitutionality, and (3) voters had no inherent right to vote for candidates unaffected by the provision. The Commonwealth's demurrer succeeded because (1) all but two of petitioners' claims had been rejected, (2) a claim that voters had a right to enjoy a judge's &quot;full service&quot; was rejected in denying the application for relief, and (2) changing a judge's retirement date to December 31st of the year in which the judge turned 70 was not irrational, as it improved orderly judicial succession, reduced vacancies from mid-year retirements, and was minimally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners judges sued respondents state officials in the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) to nullify the mandatory judicial retirement provision of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b). After initiating proceedings in the Commonwealth Court, the judges sought extraordinary relief in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which granted their application to assume plenary jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 726.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges said the provision was subject to heightened review. The supreme court disagreed because (1) a constitutional provision was strongly presumed to be inherently constitutional, so judicial review was highly deferential, and (2) given the need to balance equal protection against the right to amend the Constitution, the provision's age-related basis did not implicate such scrutiny. It met conventional rational basis review because (1) there was no compelling reason to depart from precedent so holding, and (2) it was not so unrelated to achieving legitimate purposes that it could be concluded that the people's actions in adopting it were irrational. It did not violate the anti-discrimination protections of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 because (1) Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 was of recent vintage, so a claim that it enshrined rights pre-existing the Constitution was not compelling, and (2) Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 was approved substantially contemporaneously with Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16 (2001), so the former was not likely intended to forbid the latter. The provision did not offend due process because judges had no property interest in serving past their constitutional retirement date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was remanded to the Commonwealth Court for dismissal of the complaints with prejudice and entry of judgment in favor of the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found no violation under Brady, as the evidence supported the finding that no there were no promises made to prosecution witnesses who were co-perpetrators in the criminal incident. The affidavit upon which a search warrant of the inmate's mother's home was based provided probable cause, and the scope of the search was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV. As there were security concerns, having a deputy sheriff dressed in plain clothes sit at the defense table was warranted. Despite multiple assertions by the inmate, there was no ineffectiveness shown in counsel's questioning of witnesses, failure to object to after-hours trial sessions, or in other regards. The aggravator under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(d)(9) was clearly applicable, and an instruction on &sect; 9711(d)(6) was appropriately provided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The entities furnished out-of-home child welfare and/or juvenile justice services under county contracts. They challenged changes to DPW's practices and policies in determining appropriate reimbursement of county expenditures for out-of-home, child-welfare placement services, arguing that DPW, through a series of recent administrative bulletins, had unilaterally and inappropriately substituted a restrictive, statewide rate-setting process in place of the prior regime. The supreme court held that the commonwealth court did not err in concluding that the bulletin contained procedurally invalid legislative regulations. The bulletin was practically binding, or binding enough. The availability of federal and state funding very often would be of critical importance in the local decision-making. The Legislature did not wholly relieve DPW of compliance with all of the formalities attending legislative rule-making in the child-welfare arena, and nothing in the Public Welfare Code or the derivative regulations persuaded the supreme court that the policy shift manifested in the bulletin could be fairly denominated as a mere interpretation of pre-existing legislative rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a decision of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a trial court judgment of sentence of a mandatory life-without-parole sentence for defendant's conviction of first-degree murder under former 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1102(a)(1) (superseded by 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1102.1). He was also convicted and sentenced on other charges. Defendant was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fatally shot one victim and shot another victim who was seriously injured but recovered. At the time, defendant was 14 years old. He indicated that he was forced to do it by a superior gang member. Despite his defense of duress, the jury convicted defendant and he was sentenced to, inter alia, a mandatory term of life imprisonment without parole pursuant to former &sect; 1102(a)(1) and 61 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6137(a)(1). His post-sentence motions were denied. The Superior Court upheld the sentence. On further review and upon consideration of developing jurisprudence, the court noted that judicial consideration of appropriate age-related factors was required prior to imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile. Accordingly, the sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The appropriate remedy was the imposition of a minimum sentence that took age-appropriate factors into account. A categorical ban on the life-without-parole sentences on juvenile offenders was not required by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, as it did not require a broader approach to proportionality for juveniles than was reflected in prevailing United States Supreme Court jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the Superior Court and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court did not err in dismissing defendant's Batson claim where he failed to prove actual, purposeful discrimination in the Commonwealth's exercise of its peremptory challenges. The lower court also properly rejected defendant's Brady claims where, inter alia, any Brady concerns related to the victim's crack cocaine sales had been raised by a codefendant, thereby vitiating any such concerns. Defendant's claim of ineffective counsel was rejected where the jury was informed that a witness had identified another as the person who initially kidnapped the victim, and thus, he failed to show any prejudice as a result of trial counsel's failure in having the witness' entire statement read into the record. However, the lower court's order as to an ineffective counsel claim based on the failure to impeach an eyewitness was vacated where there was no record concerning counsel's strategic basis for the decision not to impeach that witness with evidence of motive and bias or with testimony from another individual concerning defendant's whereabouts during the relevant time period. The remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an interlocutory appeal by permission, the Commonwealth agencies challenged an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) holding that the court had jurisdiction to consider the bidder's action challenging the cancellation of a request for proposals and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relative to controversies in matters arising from procurement contracts with Commonwealth agencies, the Board of Claims retained exclusive jurisdiction (subject to all jurisdictional prerequisites), which was not to be supplanted by a court of law through an exercise of original jurisdiction. As to challenges to cancellations of solicitations asserted under 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 521 of the Procurement Code, the legislature did not implement any waiver of sovereign immunity and afforded no remedy to aggrieved bidders and offerors which have not yet entered into an executed contract with a Commonwealth agency. For those attaining the status of contractor, which the court found should be deemed to occur at the time a contract is executed by all parties, the remedial procedure was via 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1712.1, subject to review within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Claims. Thus, the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction over the bidder's action against two agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, various jury commissioners and related others, sought review of an order from an en banc panel of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which denied their motion for judgment on the pleadings, and granted a motion by intervenor, the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, for judgment on the pleadings. The matter involved constitutional challenges to Act 108 of 2011, 2011 Pa. Laws 442.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initial proposal for 2011 Pa. Laws 442 related to electronic and online sales of personal property and surplus farm equipment. After passing through the legislative process, an additional proposal was included regarding the abolishment of the office of jury commissioner. The bill passed out of the Senate and the House, and was signed into law by the Governor. The jury commissioners sought injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to their constitutional challenges to 2011 Pa. Laws 442. Challenges included that it was violative of the &quot;single subject rule&quot; of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, the separation of powers doctrine of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 1 and 10, and the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Commonwealth Court rejected the constitutional challenges and dismissed the matter. On appeal, the court found that 2011 Pa. Laws 442 was unconstitutional with respect to the single subject challenge. The law sought to combine topics that were not sufficiently germane to each other. The label of &quot;powers of county commissioners&quot; was overly broad and could not be sufficiently narrowed where it included both executive and legislative functions of the board.</SPAN></P>

The PRO determined that certain chiropractic treatments were not necessary or reasonable, and the insurer refused to pay for such treatment. The provider then commenced a civil action against the insurer, seeking compensation for unpaid bills in the amount of $1380. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court consistently followed the general, American rule that there could be no recovery of attorneys' fees from an adverse party, absent an express statutory authorization, a clear agreement by the parties, or some other established exception. 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1797(b)(4) authorized appeals by providers from insurer refusals to pay for treatment, the reasonableness or necessity of which the insurer had not challenged before a peer review organization.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged an order from the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an administrative determination that the taxpayer's gains from the sale of a tract of Delaware timberland was business income subject to taxation in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the gain was business income as defined in 72 Pa. Stat.

Because the statute was phrased in the disjunctive, it was immaterial whether the disposition of the timberland was also an integral part of the taxpayer's regular business operations. The court further held that although Delaware already had taxed the entire gain, Pennsylvania's duplicative taxation of a portion of the gain did not violate the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution because the taxpayer was a unitary business and Pennsylvania's apportionment formula was fairly applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which granted partial relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546, and determined that appellee inmate was ineligible for the death penalty due to his mental retardation. The trial court also denied the Commonwealth's motion to reopen. The inmate filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was involved in the shooting deaths of two people and shootings of two other victims who survived. He was convicted of first-degree murder as well as lesser charges. The jury imposed death sentences, and a direct appeal resulted in an affirmance. The inmate sought PCRA relief and asserted an Atkins claim. The Commonwealth's motion to reopen the record, based on evidence that allegedly cast doubt on the inmate's claims of mental retardation due to his use of smuggled cell phones and other conduct, was denied. The PCRA court concluded that the inmate had limited intellectual functioning, and it vacated the death sentences. On appeal, the court determined that for an Atkins claim on collateral review, the preponderance of the evidence standard remained appropriate, and that the use of the factors dictated in Ex Parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), was helpful in assessing an inmate's adaptive functioning. However, it determined that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen, as the additional evidence was relevant, there was no prejudice to the inmate, and there was a concern as to a fraud perpetrated on the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the trial court with respect to the denial of the Commonwealth's motion to reopen, as well as the accompanying order which found the inmate mentally retarded and vacated his death sentences. The remainder of the requested relief was denied, and the matter was remanded for further Atkins proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court considered appellant's capital appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County (Pennsylvania) denying his petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546. Appellant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found no error in the PCRA court's finding that there was no obvious objective indication to counsel, state police, or the trial court that appellant suffered from any mental illness at the time he confessed his crimes, such that the police conduct could be viewed as unconstitutional manipulation warranting suppression. The supreme court had recognized that a defendant convicted of multiple murders had a difficult task in establishing his claim that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to adequately investigate and present evidence in mitigation. In instances where the result concerning prejudice was not self-evident, but instead required careful analysis of prejudice in the specific factual context of the case, the supreme court had remanded for the PCRA court to conduct the prejudice inquiry. As the evidence of the experts offered at the PCRA hearing established the possibility of additional mitigating circumstances, the supreme court concluded that the better course was to have the PCRA court conduct the prejudice inquiry assisted by relevant advocacy from both sides. Accordingly, remand was required for an appropriate Strickland inquiry into prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the PCRA court was affirmed insofar as it dismissed all claims other than that of ineffective assistance of counsel associated with the investigation, development, and presentation of mitigation evidence. With respect to this claim, the PCRA court's order was vacated, and the matter was remanded for further consideration consistent with the opinion. Jurisdiction was relinquished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed his sentence imposing the lifetime registration provisions of Megan's Law, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1(b), following his guilty plea to three charges of criminal solicitation to commit sexual abuse of a child and a single attempt to corrupt a minor charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant asserted that because the two or more enumerated offenses committed were within the same episode, such a harsh penalty was unwarranted. The evenly divided state supreme court found that the registration requirements of Megan's Law were not intended to be penal in nature. The primary purpose of the registration requirement was not to punish an individual convicted of sexual offenses, but, instead, registration was mandated for the protection of the public. Appellant entered a guilty plea, thereby admitting that he committed the act of soliciting the undercover state police officer posing as a 19-year-old female to obtain nude photographs of a person whom he believed to be a 13-year-old child, and also that he committed the act of soliciting the undercover state police officer posing as the 19-year-old female to procure the 13-year-old child so that he could engage in sexual activity with the child, which was deemed to be sexual exploitation. Thus, the clear terms of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1(b)(1) required appellant to register with the Pennsylvania State Police for life because he had two convictions for offenses specifically listed in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the state supreme court was evenly divided, the order of the superior court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant law opponents (LOs) sought review of a single-judge order from the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which denied their application for a preliminary injunction (PI) in their petition for review, challenging the constitutional validity of Act 18 of 2012, also known as the Voter ID Law and codified at 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2626(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Voter ID Law generally required the presentation of a photo identification (ID) card as a prerequisite to the casting of ballots by most registered voters. The Law contemplated that a driver's license or the non-driver equivalent under &sect; 1510(b) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1510(b), would primarily be used. However, the Department of Transportation (DOT) imposed a somewhat rigorous process on applicants. It was acknowledged that the Law was not being implemented according to its terms, and that some registered voters would be unable to comply with the DOT's requirements for obtaining a card under &sect; 1510(b). The LOs asserted a facial constitutional challenge to the Law under Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5 and sought to preliminarily enjoin its implementation. The Commonwealth Court denied relief, noting that other methods to obtain a valid ID card were being expeditiously implemented. On appeal, the court found that the Commonwealth Court had to assess the actual availability of the alternate ID cards to determine whether there would be voter disenfranchisement for purposes of the upcoming election that required a PI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the Commonwealth Court and returned the matter to the Commonwealth Court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the judgment of the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which vacated appellee's conviction for first-degree murder, aggravated assault, carrying a firearm without a license, and possessing an instrument of crime. Appellee had been convicted following a jury trial and was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment for murder and an aggregate concurrent term of 10 to 20 years of imprisonment on the remaining charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was at a bar and harassed two women that had rebuked his advance. The victim witnessed appellee's treatment of the women and intervened. The pair began fighting. It was undisputed that the victim punched appellee multiple times before appellee pulled his gun and shot the victim in the head. Appellee asserted self defense but never testified at his trial. The Superior Court reversed appellee's convictions upon concluding that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the victim's prior criminal record. The Court determined that the Superior Court erred in concluding that there was adequate evidence of self-defense presented at trial to render the victim's prior record potentially admissible because appellee never provided any subjective testimony on what he believed to justify using deadly force. Further, the court held that the Superior Court erred in finding that the trial court improperly excluded evidence of the victim's prior conviction because such evidence was not relevant to the questions of whether appellee was free from fault. The Court held that the exclusion of such evidence was not a proper basis for overturning the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, individual school employees from multiple school districts and the Pennsylvania State Education Association, an organization whose membership consisted of teachers and education support professionals, sought review of the Commonwealth Court's (Pennsylvania) jurisdiction where the school employees sought injunctive and declaratory relief against appellee Office of Open Records (OOR) as to their  home addresses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth Court granted two petitions to intervene and sustained the OOR's preliminary objections, finding that it lacked jurisdiction because the employees had not named an indispensable Commonwealth party as a defendant. The employees argued that the Commonwealth Court erred by refusing to exercise its original jurisdiction over their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief where numerous Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67.101-67.3104, requests were filed with school districts across Pennsylvania, seeking disclosure of the names and home addresses of school employees. Plainly, the Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), as presently implemented by the OOR, did not provide public school employees with a reliable administrative or judicial method by which to seek redress for action that they believe violated the statutory scheme and/or their constitutional rights; thus, it was just and proper for the OOR to be haled into court to address core and colorable issues connected with such treatment at the behest of affected persons and their associations as justice could not be done in the OOR's absence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Commonwealth Court was vacated, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court opinion. Jurisdiction was relinquished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued, inter alia, that counsel were ineffective under U.S. Const. amend. VI for failing to investigate or develop a defense of diminished capacity due to voluntary intoxication or mental defect. The supreme court disagreed. The only evidence cited by appellant that supported the viability of a defense grounded in diminished capacity due to mental defect was one excerpt of the testimony of a psychiatrist who evaluated appellant years after the murders. Appellant failed to recognize that the evidence presented at trial strongly indicated that, at the time of the victim's murder, appellant was able to formulate the intent to evade the authorities, who he knew were seeking him in connection with a prior homicide; to steal a car from the victim and drive to a remote area with her as a passenger; to take her cash, as well as her credit cards and rings, which he attempted to sell; and to drive away rapidly in her vehicle after firing three shots. All of that evidence of appellant's directed, intentional, goal-oriented activity at or near the time of the murder argued strongly against his assertion that diminished capacity would have been a viable guilt-phase defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's postconviction motion dealt with three cases, two rape cases and a murder case. On appeal, the inmate claimed, inter alia, that his right to counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was violated when he was questioned about an earlier rape case and the murder case while he was in custody for the second rape case, which was brought first. The supreme court concluded a remand was necessary, because the parties disagreed over whether the right was invoked and there was no clear answer in the record. While the inmate remained silent and counsel was appointed, there was nothing indicating that he specifically invoked the right to counsel. The supreme court found merit in any other errors claimed by the parties. Among other things, the supreme court noted that although the inmate's intelligence scores and age of onset met the definition of mental retardation, the third element was not established, as the record only revealed limitation in one area, academics and thus, the inmate was subject to the death penalty. However, the award of a new penalty phase was proper, as counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating mental health evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for a determination of whether the inmate invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel in relation to the first action. The judgment of the PCRA court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a not-for-profit religious entity, challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order of a trial court that upheld appellee county board of assessment's denial of appellant's real estate tax exemption request, pursuant to Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(a)(v). Intervenor school district was also a party to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant operated a summer camp in the county and sought a property tax exemption as a purely public charity. Appellee denied the exemption request, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed, reasoning that occasional use of appellant's recreational and dining facilities by county residents was insufficient to prove it relieved the county's government of its burden as required by the case law test entitled HUP. Appellant argued on appeal that the Pennsylvania Legislature's enactment of criteria in the Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act (Act 55), 10 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 371-385, for determining if an organization qualifies as a purely public charity under Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 was deserving of deference in deciding whether an organization qualifies. The Court disagreed and held that to receive a real estate tax exemption without violating the Pennsylvania Constitution, the party must meet the definition of a purely public charity as measured by the test in HUP. If it did so, it may qualify for the exemption if it meets the statute's requirements. Act 55, however, cannot excuse the constitutional minimum: if you do not qualify under the HUP test, you never get to the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class were &quot;police officers&quot; for purposes of collective bargaining under Act 111. The trial court found that they were not, determining that the deputies had failed to demonstrate that they could meet a two-pronged test. The appellate court found, however, that the controlling factor was that the general assembly, in two pieces of legislation, specifically singled out for definition as police officers, deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class. Deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class had been specifically designated by the general assembly as police officers in the Crimes Code and the Municipal Police Education and Training Law, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 103 and 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2162. Deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class were police officers for purposes of Act 111. Thus, the labor board's and the trial court's application of a judicially and administratively created test to examine this issue was erroneous. Nothing in 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1101.805, relied upon in part by the trial court, compelled, or even suggested, a different result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors had argued that the nomination paper was invalid because the circulator of those pages resided outside the legislative district, in violation of &sect; 2911(d) of the Pennsylvania Election Code, 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2600-3591. The candidate relied on Morrill v. Weaver, in which a federal district court had held that &sect; 2911(d) violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court had ruled that &sect; 2911(d) was valid and set the nomination paper aside. The high court had reversed and remanded the case with instructions to decide it on nonconstitutional grounds; it reserved jurisdiction over the constitutional issue. On appeal, the candidate renewed his First Amendment argument. The high court held that while this issue was moot, since the candidate had not appealed the trial court's order on remand, it addressed it because of its public importance and potential to recur. Morrill, which had permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing &sect; 2911(d) on grounds it violated the First Amendment, had preclusive effect because the Commonwealth had fully litigated the matter and had not appealed; therefore, &sect; 2911(d) was unenforceable, absent legislative amendment.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth argued that the superior court erred in finding the evidence insufficient to conclude defendant had a &quot;residence&quot; as defined in Megan's Law. Defendant argued he was not in violation of Megan's Law because it required registration of a residence, which he did not have because he was homeless. The supreme court concluded that the lower courts erred, holding that defendant's obligation to notify police was triggered when he changed his previous residence, not when his new residence was established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, voters in the enumerated districts, filed suit against respondents, the Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (HOR) and the Secretary of the Commonwealth, seeking, inter alia, a request for mandamus relief in order to compel the Speaker to issue writs of elections for special elections in order to fill vacancies in the HOR.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the voters met their burden with respect to their mandamus request. They showed that they had a clear legal right to elected representation in the HOR districts. Further, the right had to be vindicated at special elections due to vacancies of certain seats pursuant to Pa. Const. art I, &sect; 5. The court also noted that the Speaker of the HOR, as its presiding officer, had the corresponding duty to issue writs of election for special elections to fill those vacancies pursuant to Pa. Const. art II, &sect; 2. It was noted that the duty was mandatory, ministerial, and nondiscretionary. The court concluded that there was no apparent reason why the constitutionally mandated, ministerial duty to issue writs of election to fill the vacant seats should be deferred pending the outcome of the reapportionment process under Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 17. The discretion conferred in the limited exception under 25 Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturers challenged the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which reversed a trial court's grant of summary judgment in their favor. Appellees, a worker and his wife, filed a personal injury action after the worker was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma. In 1990, appellees had previously filed an action against several defendants seeking compensatory damages for work-related pulmonary asbestosis and lung cancer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellants summary judgment after acknowledging that the Pennsylvania Superior Court in Marinari adopted, for purposes of asbestos litigation, a two-disease, or separate disease, rule, allowing a plaintiff to bring one action based on a nonmalignant asbestos disease and a subsequent action for any separately diagnosed malignant disease, but finding that the two-disease rule permitted a plaintiff to bring only one cause of action for nonmalignant diseases caused by asbestos exposure. Since appellees had previously filed an action for the malignant disease of lung cancer, the trial court held that they were precluded from bringing a subsequent action for the malignant disease of mesothelioma. The Superior Court reversed, finding that the separate disease rule allowed an individual to bring separate lawsuits for more than one malignant disease which allegedly resulted from the same asbestos exposure. The Court agreed, holding that a plaintiff who is diagnosed with a malignant disease, and later diagnosed with a separate and distinct malignant disease caused by the same asbestos exposure, may benefit from the separate disease rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the Superior Court and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In twelve separate matters, appellant citizens, acting singly or in groups, filed appeals from the Final Plan for legislative redistricting of Pennsylvania, which was devised by appellee, the 2011 Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission (the LRC), in response to the U.S. decennial census.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the court ordered accelerated briefing and oral argument, the LRC failed to adopt a Final Plan in a timeframe that offered the remote prospect of appellate review before the primary season began. The LRC's inexplicable delay ensured that primary candidates who relied upon the Final Plan did so at their peril. The delay of the LRC in producing a Final Plan created a situation where the election primary season was disrupted. In any event, the citizens demonstrated that the Final Plan, considered as a whole, contained numerous political subdivision splits that were not absolutely necessary, and the Plan thus violated the constitutional command with respect to the integrity of political subdivisions found in Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. Furthermore, the citizens showed that the LRC could have easily achieved a substantially greater fidelity to all of the mandates in art. II, &sect; 16, including compactness, contiguity, and integrity of political subdivisions, yet the LRC did not do so in the Final Plan. Accordingly, an order was issued under Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 17(d) declaring the Plan contrary to law, and remand to the LRC for reapportionment was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a per curiam order, the court declared that the Final Plan was unconstitutional. It remanded the matter to the LRC to reapportion the Commonwealth in a manner consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, appellee was found guilty of second-degree murder, theft by unlawful taking, and fleeing or attempting to elude an officer, but he was acquitted of first-degree murder, robbery, aggravated assault, and possessing an instrument of crime. The jury rendered no verdict on third-degree murder and theft by receiving stolen property. Appellee appealed to the Superior Court, contending that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his second-degree murder conviction because he had been acquitted of the predicate offense of robbery. The Superior Court reversed appellee's second-degree murder conviction and vacated his judgment of sentence upon concluding that since the jury had acquitted him of robbery, the Commonwealth failed to prove that he killed the victim while in perpetration of a robbery. The court held that the Superior Court erred by concluding that a jury's verdict of guilt on a second-degree murder charge and its acquittal on the predicate felony of robbery were impermissibly inconsistent and could not stand. The court found that the Superior Court misapplied case law precedent and should have accepted the inconsistent verdicts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's PCRA petition raised a Brady claim. The PCRA court determined that appellant's Brady claim was time barred.

The court criticized the practice of holding a serial PCRA petition in abeyance pending federal review of appellant's previously exhausted claims. As a result, the court held that the order below was appealable and, on the merits. The court addressed the circumstances creating uncertainty respecting appealability, in an effort to ensure that those circumstances do not arise again; and the circumstances creating the unacceptable delay in the case at bar, so that PCRA courts throughout Pennsylvania will take measures to avoid such delays. The court ultimately directed the PCRA court to promptly dispose of appellant's long-pending prior PCRA petition, which raised an Atkins issue. The court held there was no reason to hold a serial PCRA petition merely because federal cross-appeals were pending on already-exhausted habeas claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and the judgment of sentence of the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), following a jury trial finding him guilty of first degree murder, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2501(a), and other crimes, and which imposed the sentence of death against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first addressed the sufficiency of the evidence and found that the record established sufficient evidence to support appellant's first-degree murder conviction based on the uncontested forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony that the victim had been shot three times with a small caliber weapon, and that the killing was with malice and intentional because the deadly weapon was used on vital parts of the victim's body. The court found that the conviction was supported by testimony from co-defendants and eyewitnesses as to the identity of the shooter, including testimony that appellant boasted about shooting the victim. The court took the opportunity to devise a procedure for implementing the Atkins decision in Pennsylvania and approved of the procedure of a trial court submitting a colorable Atkins mental retardation issue to the jury for a penalty phase decision. The court placed the burden on the proponent of the Atkins claim, usually the defendant, to prove mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence and held that such a finding must be unanimous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Office of Attorney General (OAG), sought review of an order from the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which reversed a trial court order that held that appellee trustee bank (TB) was not entitled to receive commissions from principal pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7185 for its trust administration services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent executed a last will and testament, which provided, inter alia, for a charitable remainder. An individual and the TB were appointed as estate executors and trustees under the will. The TB filed a third account of the trust after the co-trustee died, which requested commissions out of the principal for both trustees. The trial court upheld the OAG's objection, finding that when the trust was created in 1940, more than one commission from principal was barred. The superior court reversed based upon the numerous legislative enactments that permitted more than one commission for previously established trusts. On further review, the court found that stare decisis did not apply, as the responsibilities of trustees had changed drastically since the creation of the trust. Allowing retroactive application of &sect; 7185 did not violate the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as retroactive application was a rational means of the legislature to accomplish its purpose of allowing proper and fair compensation to trustees administering trusts after February 18, 1982.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former wife (FW) of a decedent, sought review of an order from the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a trial court order. The trial court had determined that appellee estate administrator (EA) could distribute proceeds from the decedent's life insurance policy (LIP) to a contingent beneficiary (CB) pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2, rather than to the FW as the primary beneficiary (PB).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent obtained a life insurance policy pursuant to an employee group benefit plan, and he named his FW as the PB and a nephew as the CB. Although the decedent and the FW divorced, the beneficiaries remained unchanged at the time of the decedent's death. The trial court determined that the EA had the capacity to bring a show cause petition regarding the proceeds of the LIP, and that the court had subject matter jurisdiction. It found that under 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2 and 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1144(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq., the CB was entitled to the proceeds. That decision was affirmed. On further review, the court found that under 20 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 711(1), 6108, and 3311(a), the EA had the authority and capacity to file the action in the orphans' court. However, it found that the disbursement of LIP proceeds constituted the ongoing administration of an employee benefit plan, and not merely a onetime payment of benefits, pursuant to &sect; 6111.2 and 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1002(1). The court concluded that &sect; 6111.2 was superseded and preempted by the vast reach of ERISA under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1104(a)(1)(D) and 1144(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Superior Court, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held it was not error to let the prosecution argue the &quot;significant history&quot; aggravator in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(d)(9) because (1) it was not unconstitutionally vague, and (2) the fact that convictions underlying it arose from an incident occurring after the murder defendant was sentenced for did not reduce their relevance. Inconsistent verdicts as to the circumstance did not show vagueness because (1) various factors contributed to each verdict, and (2) no correlation between aggravators and mitigators and vagueness was shown. Basing the aggravator on post-murder convictions did not offend ex post facto or due process protections because &quot;significant history&quot; referred to his status at sentencing. He was not entitled to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(h)(3) relief because (1) nothing raised was objected to below, and (2) it had to be considered on collateral review in an ineffective assistance claim. The sentence was proper because (1) it was not the result of passion, prejudice, or another arbitrary factor and was based on sufficient evidence of murder, and (2) sufficient evidence showed a significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence to the person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of simple assault, terroristic threats, ethnic intimidation, and possession of instruments of crime. The Superior Court (Pennsylvania) reversed the conviction for ethnic intimidation, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2710, on the basis of insufficient evidence. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of defendant's conduct and comments made to the daughter of his employer. The intermediate appellate court held that defendant's ethnically derogatory remarks and behavior were the product of circumstances unrelated to the victim's race, specifically, defendant's anger with the victim's father over an employment issue. However, the appellate court found that &sect; 2710's intent element was satisfied by evidence that ethnic malice was a motivator for defendant's criminal act; it did not need to be the sole motivator. Evidence existed that defendant was motivated by racial animus; he made repeated references to the victim's national origin while behaving in a menacing manner. Evidence also existed that defendant was motivated by his anger with the victim's father; however, the victim was not the father but the daughter. The trial court, found sufficient evidence existed to conclude that defendant's conduct was motivated by malicious intent toward the victim's ethnicity. The intermediate appellate court failed to view the evidence of defendant's repeated derogatory ethnic slurs in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the intermediate appellate court's order reversing the ethnic intimidation conviction was reversed, and the judgment of sentence was reinstated for that offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted based on the shooting deaths of his estranged wife and her boyfriend. A prior appeal resulted in a remand in order to allow defendant to obtain DNA testing of certain blood evidence. Upon the conclusion thereof, the matter was before the court on the remaining claims raised in defendant's direct appeal. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Further, the weight of the evidence supported the convictions, such that a new trial on that basis was properly denied. There was no valid Brady claim regarding the blood evidence, as it was not exculpatory or material, and no bad faith by the Commonwealth was shown. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence. There was no prosecutorial vindictiveness where the criminal complaint and information were proper under Pa. R. Crim. P. 504(6)(a) and 560(C). The court also found no evidentiary errors or prosecutorial misconduct, and no cause for a mistrial. The trial court complied with Pa. R. Crim. P. 230(B)(2) with respect to grand jury testimony. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711 was not unconstitutional, and imposition of the death sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the supreme court was whether a person who offered a ride without previously obtaining the permission of a parent of the child, but who otherwise lacked criminal intent to harm the child, could be convicted of luring a child into a motor vehicle under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2910. The supreme court held that an attempt to lure under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2910 does not occur upon the mere offer of a ride in a motor vehicle to a child, but, rather, involves only situations where a child is provided a further enticement or inducement to enter the vehicle, in addition to the offer of the ride, particularly under such circumstances which suggest the child is being led into a potentially harmful situation. That enticement or inducement might be the promise of a pleasurable reward for entry into the vehicle such as receiving money or a treat. Likewise, a similar attractive temptation could be created with the promise of the opportunity for the child to view an object of interest like a toy, a game, or a puppy. The enticement or inducement need not necessarily be express, but could arise where the enticement and inducement is evident from the circumstances accompanying the making of an offer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court had invalidated an ordinance that imposed a one acre minimum lot size for residences in an agriculture zone, finding it unconstitutionally restricted landowners' development rights.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 10609.1 and 10916.1(a)(2)) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), consisting of a proposed new ordinance and a development plan. The board, pursuant to &sect; 609.2(1) (53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10609.2(1)) of the MPC, then declared the old ordinance invalid and enacted a new ordinance, which reduced the minimum lot size. After hearings, it rejected appellant's cure challenge. The high court held the lower courts erred by holding the board had a moratorium period to consider the high court's decision before acting on the cure challenge, as long as it &quot;acted quickly.&quot; But as the new ordinance severed the unconstitutional aspects of the old and cured the de facto defects in the district that included appellant's land, and as the board followed the procedure of &sect; 609.1, appellant had not been automatically entitled to develop its land at the specific density that it proposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) of first-degree murder of a police officer and conspiracy and sentenced to death following a penalty hearing held pursuant to a grant of federal habeas corpus relief. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said it was error to bar testimony on his future ability to adjust to a prison's general population. The supreme court held an erroneous finding that the evidence was irrelevant as a mitigating factor was harmless because Pa. R. Evid. 602 barred the witness's personal opinion. Testimony purportedly showing defendant's religious conversion was properly barred because (1) it did not make the claim more or less likely, and (2) the claim was otherwise admitted. It was no error to admit, to rebut defendant's claim of a positive prison adjustment, evidence of his pre-incarceration crimes because 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5918(1) allowed such evidence. After the federal court barred his guilty plea to another murder, it was no error to deny a mistrial when the prosecutor mentioned the plea because (1) the federal court only barred the plea's use to prove an aggravating circumstance, under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(d)(9), and (2) it was used to test his character witnesses' awareness of his past crimes. It was no error to admit the other murder's circumstances because (1) they showed motive, intent, or absence of mistake, and (2) the jury was told not to consider them as an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Department of Banking (DOB) and the Secretary of the DOB, sought review of an order from the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that the Debt Management Services Act (DMSA), 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2401-2421, 2448-2449, was unconstitutional in part. Appellee trade association (TA) filed a cross-appeal from the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the DMSA was passed, the TA, whose membership included debt settlement service (DSS) providers, challenged the constitutionality of those parts of the DMSA that were applicable to DSS providers. Both parties filed applications for summary relief. The trial court granted the TA's declaratory judgment application in part and denied it in part. It determined that various parts of the DMSA were in violation of the Non-Delegation Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, such that those portions were unconstitutional and unenforceable. Both parties appealed from that order. After they briefed the issue of whether the order was a final appealable one under Pa.R.A.P. 341, the matter was considered. The court found that the order was interlocutory and not appealable under Pa.R.A.P. 341, as the trial court did not address several of the TA's arguments and did not ultimately decide whether it was entitled to the full relief originally requested. Although a partial declaration was made, it was not a full and final declaration under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7532 because the constitutionality of multiple provisions of the DMSA remained in dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the appeals.</SPAN></P>

The convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. The inmate's PCRA petition was denied. On appeal, the court found no ineffectiveness of counsel, either during trial or on appeal, under U.S. Const. amend. VI. There was no error with respect to the failure to consolidate the homicide trials or with numerous other issues. The inmate's waiver of his right to counsel was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently done, and there could be no ineffectiveness during his self-representation. There were no evidentiary errors, no prosecutorial misconduct, and no error with jury instructions. Counsel provided sufficient mitigating evidence in the penalty phase. The inmate also failed to show errors with respect to the PCRA court's ruling as to a discovery request under Pa. R. Crim. P. 902(E)(2) and with numerous allegations of court error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of robbery, conspiracy, theft, and possession of an instrument of crime. The trial court imposed a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to &sect; 9712(a) (42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712(a)) of the Pennsylvania Judicial Code and denied defendant's subsequent motion for modification of sentence. Defendant appealed; the Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed his sentence. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Though defendant had not visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of the robbery, the trial court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence under &sect; 9712(a) because his co-conspirator had done so. Defendant's subsequent post-sentence motions and direct appeal did not concern sentencing issues. After the high court decided Commonwealth v. Dickson, which held that &sect; 9712(a) did not apply to any &quot;unarmed co-conspirators,&quot; defendant challenged his sentence under Dickson. The Commonwealth argued as his challenge involved solely discretionary aspects of his sentence, he waived it by failing to raise it in his post-sentence motions or in a Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) statement of reasons relied on for allowance of appeal. The high court disagreed. As a &quot;Dickson challenge&quot; by an unarmed co-conspirator implicated the legality of the unarmed coconspirator's sentence for purposes of issue preservation and waiver, Dickson challenges could not be waived based on a defendant's failure to raise them in post-sentence motions, or, likewise, for a defendant's failure to file a statement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal pursuant to Rule 2119(f).</SPAN></P>

However, although the objectors' brief included numerous allegations that the tactics of the circulators to procure the allegedly illegitimate signatures were known to the candidate and the campaign manager, the objectors did not make this specific objection in their petition to set aside the nomination petition. Although the candidate himself was the circulator of six separate signature pages, none of those pages was withdrawn, and none of the signatures on those pages was stipulated to as invalid. The case law of Pennsylvania that could have been read to support the proposition that a false affidavit contained in a nomination petition may have been egregious enough to void the petition altogether and remove the candidate from the ballot, applied to intentional and knowing falsehoods affirmed by the candidate personally that were designed to deceive the electorate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 1981 of murdering a police officer.

The court found error, concluding that defendant was not entitled to PCRA review of his guilt phase claims to the extent that he sought to challenge anything but the Commonwealth's failure to disclose allegedly material evidence because his petition for PCRA relief was time-barred as to those claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which preliminary enjoined appellee, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), from using a particular method of awarding bids on public contracts but denied relief as to a bridge project. PennDOT cross-appealed. The contractor filed a petition for review in the nature of a complaint in equity directed to the court's original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">PennDOT decided to rebuild two bridges and, for the first time, used innovative bidding methods for selecting contractors for highway projects outlined in a publication. Pursuant to that publication, PennDOT issued an advertisement seeking statements of interest and then short-listed three firms. The contractor issued a timely statement of interest but was not short-listed. The contractor's petition for review challenged the innovative process, contending it was contrary to the Procurement Code, 62 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 101-4509, and compromised the competitive bidding process. The Commonwealth Code agreed that the innovative procurement method, as implemented by PennDOT, was overly subjective and not authorized by the code and enjoined PennDOT from seeking and evaluating contracts under that method but did not apply its injunction to the bridge project due to the safety issues. The court agreed that the contractor was aggrieved and entitled to challenge PennDOT since it was eliminated from contention during the short-listing step. Thus, the Commonwealth Court had equity jurisdiction in light of the exclusive remedy set forth in 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1711.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order and remanded the case to the Commonwealth Court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the sentence of death imposed by the Bradford County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) after a jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2502, and one count of robbery, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3701.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions arose from the shooting death of two sheriff deputies, who had gone to the property of appellant's father to arrest appellant on outstanding warrants. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of first-degree murder based on appellant expressly admitting to his friend that he shot the deputies as they attempted to take him into custody, he acknowledged his responsibility for causing the deaths of the deputies in a tearful port-arrest declaration to a trooper and others present at a jail infirmity, and there was no evidence that he was in fear for his life at the time the deputies attempted to take him into custody. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court's denial of appellant's motions for a change of venue because the record established that the trial court took great care to establish whether the news coverage of the incident deprived appellant of the ability to seat an impartial jury by conducting a painstaking and searching voir dire of the prospective jurors and giving appellant considerable latitude in questioning all of the potential jurors. The court overall found no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estates brought suits against defendant manufacturer for asbestos exposure. In response to defendant's global summary judgment motion, they argued that 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 was unconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial courts granted summary judgment for defendant, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reiterated that in Pennsylvania, a party had to be aggrieved in order to possess standing to pursue litigation. Aggrievability was obtained by having a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in proceedings or litigation. When the standards for substantiality, directness, and immediacy were readily met, the inquiry into aggrievability, and therefore standing, ended. Should, however, a party's immediate interest not be apparent, a zone of interests analysis could be employed. Here, plaintiffs had standing to pursue their constitutional challenges. First, their interests were substantial, as their lawsuits were subject to dismissal under &sect; 1929.1. Second, there was a direct connection between the constitutional violations asserted and the harm complained of, as defendant was invoking the protections of a potentially unconstitutional statute to obtain automatic and irreversible dismissal of plaintiffs' causes of action. Finally, plaintiffs' interests were immediate, because only defendant's invocation of &sect; 1929.1 caused the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims. The ability of plaintiffs to recover from other manufacturers was of no concern within the instant analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Superior Court, which had affirmed the trial courts' grants of summary judgment. It remanded the appeal to the Superior Court for full consideration of the merits of plaintiffs' constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant limited liability company filed a petition for review in the nature of a complaint in equity against appellees, the Department of Banking and the Secretary of Banking. The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) granted summary judgment to appellees. It held that the Department had the authority to apply 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6203.A to lenders without offices or personnel in Pennsylvania. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was in the business of making short-term &quot;payday&quot; loans to Pennsylvania residents over the Internet. It was not licensed under the Consumer Discount Company Act (CDCA), 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6201-6219. The court stated that the plain language of &sect; 6203.A made it unlawful for any unlicensed lender to make the specified types of loans in the Commonwealth, regardless of whether it was physically located or had personnel in the Commonwealth. Next, the court rejected appellant's argument that the Department's new interpretation of &sect; 6203.A as explained in a notice was the promulgation of a new regulation, as opposed to a statement of policy. In issuing the notice, the Department did not invoke its authority to issue binding rules and regulations. It very clearly expressed that the notice articulated its interpretation of the law. Next, because appellant sought a declaration that it was not violating the CDCA, it could not complain that the trial court lacked authority to declare it was violating the CDCA. Finally, appellant had waived its argument that it would be subject to a retroactive application of the trial court's order. Moreover, the argument appeared to be hypothetical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee objectors brought a petition to set aside appellant candidate's nominating paper. The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) granted the petition and ordered the Secretary of the Commonwealth to strike the candidate's name from the general election ballot for the office of state representative. The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors asserted a challenge to individual signatures the candidate's nominating paper as well as a &quot;global&quot; challenge to three pages of signatures on the paper because the circulator of those pages was not a resident of the district, in violation of 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2911(d). The candidate argued that the global challenge failed because &sect; 2911(d) was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the extent it imposed a residency requirement. The trial court rejected the First Amendment claim, but failed to decide a potentially dispositive non-constitutional challenge. The decision on the global challenge was not sustainable on the record. Neither the lower court nor the objectors forwarded any substantive justification of the rejection of this argument. Nor did the lower court or the objectors respond to the candidate's related claim of reliance on the Secretary's actions and directions in altering its nominating paper form. The power to not be bound by lower federal court rulings did not absolve a state court of its obligation to decide properly presented federal claims on the merits. Nothing in the record or the pleadings provided a basis to affirm the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for an immediate hearing to determine the individual signature challenges asserted in the petition. The trial court was directed to issue an order forthwith either dismissing or sustaining the challenge, and implementing its decision as necessary. Jurisdiction was otherwise retained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee asserted that his land became landlocked as a result of the Commonwealth's exercise of eminent domain to build an interstate.

The Commonwealth Court, in affirming the trial court, determined that all lands in Pennsylvania were encumbered with a six percent incorporeal burden for the building of a public road system, which included private roads and that the creation of a private road under the PRA did not constitute a taking in the ordinary sense. The Court found no support for the Commonwealth Court's conclusion and held that a physical invasion and permanent occupation of private property, such as that which would be accomplished by the creation of a private road under the PRA was a taking. The Court found that the Commonwealth Court had neither supplied a sufficient rationale to support its theory of a statewide incorporeal burden nor put into application the prevailing standard governing takings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sued appellant hospital for malpractice. The trial court granted the hospital summary judgment; the Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed. The high court affirmed, holding that an otherwise competent and qualified nurse was not prohibited by the Pennsylvania Professional Nursing Law (PNL), 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 211 et seq., from giving expert testimony at trial regarding medical causation. It granted the hospital's motion for reargument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Flanagan v. Labe, the high court had held that a nurse could not offer opinion testimony as to the identity and cause of a medical condition since such testimony constituted a medical diagnosis, which a nurse was precluded from making under the PNL. In affirming the intermediate appellate court, the high court sua sponte reversed Flanagan, and ruled that its decision applied retroactively to the parties in the instant case. The hospital argued that the sua sponte reversal and its retroactive application denied it its due process rights of notice and an opportunity to be heard. The high court held that while neither party had argued that Flanagan should be overruled, it was appropriate for the high court to examine the viability of Flanagan in rendering its decision. In its prior opinion, the high court concluded that the rule established in Flanagan was akin to a procedural ruling, and thus its reversal of Flanagan properly was applied retroactively. The hospital offered no argument or case law to suggest this determination was in error. It offered no argument in its brief that the high court had not already considered in reaching the decision set forth in its original opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reaffirmed its prior decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city enacted a reorganization ordinance (RO) abolishing the Philadelphia Board of Revision of Taxes (BRT). Petitioners, the BRT and its members, individually and in their official capacities, filed applications for leave to file original process and for the exercise of original jurisdiction, seeking to halt implementation of the RO and a salary ordinance (SO) by a preliminary injunction or by quo warranto, prohibition, and mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The RO, ratified by the electorate, abolished the BRT and replaced it with two new bodies. As the RO's validity was of immediate public concern, the issue was one of law, and petitioners had a clear right to relief, the high court exercised plenary jurisdiction over the issue under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 726. It struck the BRT and its members, to the extent they sued in their official capacities, as parties, leaving only members suing as individuals, as the stricken parties did not have the city solicitor's authorization to prosecute the case with private counsel. The RO's transfer of the BRT's adjudicative function to a board of appeals was not authorized 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13132(c) and was ultra vires; petitioners were entitled to a permanent injunction preventing implementation of that portion of the RO. The other provisions of the RO were valid and severable. The issue of the validity of the SO, which reduced BRT members' salaries, did not require the high court's accelerated review. Quo warranto was not warranted, as there was no challenge to anyone's right to public office, and the permanent injunction rendered the request for a preliminary injunction, mandamus, and prohibition moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court entered a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the RO to the extent it abolished the BRT with respect to its appellate function; transferred BRT employees to the board of appeals; and provided that the board of appeals would perform the BRT's appellate function. Petitioners' requests for a preliminary injunction, quo warranto, prohibition, and mandamus were dismissed. The high court did not review their challenge to the SO.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 1690.112a (Act 53) of the Pennsylvania Drug and Alcohol Abuse Control Act. The Superior Court also denied the juvenile's contention that he was denied due process by virtue of his restraint prior to and during his hearing. The juvenile argued that Act 53 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile's grandmother filed a petition pursuant to Act 53 to compel him to receive drug and alcohol abuse treatment on an involuntary basis. The Juvenile Court, entered a preliminary order appointing counsel for the juvenile and ordered him to undergo a drug and alcohol assessment by a licensed drug addiction counselor. It also directed him to appear for a hearing. Sheriffs deputies took custody of him at his home and transported him to the hearing. The juvenile court granted the grandmother's petition and ordered the juvenile to receive inpatient treatment for marijuana dependency. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that Act 53 provided sufficient protection to pass constitutional muster. An assessment rendered by the statutorily-prescribed professionals satisfied the requirement of a decision made by appropriate medical personnel. The protections provided by Act 53 at the hearing to determine the propriety of treatment met the minimum protections mandated by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in requiring the juvenile to remain restrained during the brief Act 53 proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constitutional challenge was rejected. The order of the lower court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Both appellant and the Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that appellant had not shown that the alleged shortcomings of a county's indigent capital defense system in the mid-1990's were so extreme as to cause structural defects that tainted the entire mechanism of his trial and sentencing, so that the presumption of effectiveness was reversed. As for counsel's failure to argue that appellant was entitled to specific performance of a plea agreement, it was well within the District Attorney's discretion to condition the acceptance of appellant's guilty plea upon the agreement of his codefendant to take the plea agreement. Next, the PCRA court properly found that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mental health mitigation evidence. Trial counsel knew that appellant had been treated for mental disorders arising from appellant's sexual abuse; the murder occurred after the victim propositioned appellant for sex; and the mitigation evidence would have supported two mitigating factors not considered by the jury, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(e)(2) and (3). There was ample evidence that appellant was prejudiced by trial counsel's ineffectiveness, as the jury found no mitigating circumstances at all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Office of General Counsel filed a tort action against appellant pharmaceutical company. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) denied appellant's motion to disqualify contingent fee counsel retained by appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the threshold issue was whether appellant had standing under 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 732-103 to challenge counsel's representation of appellee. The court held that the language of &sect; 732-103 was clear and unambiguous and thus clearly indicated the General Assembly's intent. The obvious interpretation of &sect; 732-103 was that no party to an action, other than the Commonwealth agency involved in the action itself, could challenge the authority of the agency's legal representation. Because the statutory language was plain and unambiguous, the alternative construction offered by appellant had to fail. There was no merit to appellant's argument that the matter involved not a Commonwealth agency as plaintiff, but the Commonwealth itself. The action in fact was filed on behalf of two Commonwealth agencies. Although the parties did not advert to traditional standing principles, the limitation of &sect; 732-103 aligned with those principles. It was difficult to see how a party-opponent in active litigation with the Commonwealth could be said to have a substantial, direct and immediate interest in the authority or identity of the legal representation the Commonwealth had chosen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of, inter alia, first-degree murder of a police officer and multiple counts of reckless endangerment of another person (REAP). A death sentence and other consecutive terms of imprisonment were imposed on him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped and he was taken to a medical center. Defendant grabbed a police officer's gun and shot officers and others. He was charged and eventually entered a guilty plea to the murder charge, and nolo contendere pleas to the other charges. On appeal, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the murder conviction. The determination that defendant was competent to stand trial was proper, despite his depressive disorder, and there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of his continuance request in order to undergo neuropsychological testing. Evidence related to the circumstances surrounding his prior violent felony convictions was properly admitted for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(d)(9). The jury's finding of no mitigating circumstances was not against the weight of the evidence, despite evidence of defendant's family history, his mental illnesses, and his alcohol and drug abuse. His sentence of death was not the result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. However, the sentence imposed on the REAP convictions exceeded the statutory maximum. There was no basis for the trial judge to recuse himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence with respect to the death sentence, but it vacated the sentence imposed on defendant for the counts of REAP. The matter was remanded for resentencing on those counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured filed a petition against appellant insurer to set aside an arbitration award that implemented an offset under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1722 for disability payments the insured had received. The trial court vacated the award, and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the trial court's decision. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an automobile accident, the insured received income-loss benefits under a group plan and benefits under two personal disability policies. Later, he sought to recover income-loss benefits under an underinsured motorist policy. The court held that the benefits the insured received under his group plan and personal disability policies fell within the group/program/arrangement classification for purposes of &sect; 1722. There was no tenable basis to support limiting the scope of &sect; 1722 to health benefits. Once it was accepted that the relevant income-loss benefits received by the insured fell within the group/program/arrangement classification, it became apparent that they were subject to the specified statutory offset. Section 1722 specifically directed that its prohibition and offset prescriptions applied relative to &quot;any program, group contract or other arrangement for payment of benefits.&quot; Under the plain terms of &sect; 1722, an insured's recovery under uninsured/underinsured policies could be offset by group/program/arrangement benefits, including disability benefits purchased in whole or in part by the insured, at least so long as those benefits were not subject to subrogation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ICJJ was established to conduct a non-criminal investigation and review of the juvenile justice system in a particular county regarding the allegations of misconduct of two judges. The JCB's pleading requested that the Court issue an order precluding the ICJJ from compelling answers to the questions from any JCB witness who was called to testify, and from compelling the production of any documents pursuant to subpoenas or document requests. The JCB essentially asserted that the information and documents sought by the ICJJ were protected under the Pennsylvania Constitution because they relate to judicial conduct complaints where no formal charges have been filed and the subjects of the investigations have expressly declined to waive confidentiality. The Court interpreted Pa. Jud. Conduct Bd. R.P. 18 and held that Rule 18 did not preclude the JCB from disclosing matters relating to misconduct complaints filed against judges simply because no formal charges have yet been filed by the JCB. The Court noted that the ICJJ had assured the Court that it would maintain the confidentiality of the complaints it had requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court directed the JCB to disclose the requested misconduct complaint under seal. The Court refused to order the disclosure of the  ICJJ's requests for other investigative materials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted along with co-defendant for the murder of his girlfriend in an apparent love triangle. The court found that the evidence sufficiently established that appellant strangled the victim with speaker wire after restraining her movement. On appeal, appellant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to sever his trial from co-defendant's. The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion since neither denied that they murdered the victim, rather, they only disputed the roles each played in the murder. The fact that each blamed one another was insufficient to warrant separate trials based on antagonistic defenses. The court further found no violation of appellant's Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI, rights as a result of the admission of co-defendant's confession. Further, the court found that the sentence of death was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor since the evidence established that he strangled the victim. Further, the evidence supported the finding that at least one aggravating factor was proven, namely that appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a kidnapping, a felony.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed, inter alia, that his convictions for first-degree murder and criminal conspiracy were not supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's gang leader gave orders that any member of the rival gang should be shot on sight. A day or two later, a witness saw defendant and a codefendant begin firing shots down the street. The victim was shot and killed. Several months later defendant was observed throwing one of the guns used in the victim's murder into the street. His girlfriend admitted that he had her buy the gun two days before the victim was shot. Another witness testified that the codefendant had stated that he and defendant had shot someone in the face the night of the murder. The appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for first-degree murder and conspiracy. The evidence at trial did not support a voluntary manslaughter charge. Defendant failed to offer any acceptable grounds for severance. The sentence of death was not a product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; rather, it was based on the evidence presented at trial. The sentence of death was not a product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the evidence supported the jury's finding of at least one aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which vacated and remanded a trial court order that denied respondent city's petition to vacate the arbitration award entered by an arbitrator, which sustained a grievance filed by respondent, a police union organization, and reinstated respondent grievant. An arbitration was conducted pursuant to Act 111, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 217.1 - 217.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grievant was a police officer who was alleged to have sexually assaulted another officer. Upon receiving notice that he was going to be terminated from his employment with the city's police department, a grievance was filed by the union on the grievant's behalf. The Commonwealth Court had held that the arbitrator violated the city's due process rights when the arbitrator precluded it from presenting any evidence because of its failure to comply with a duly issued subpoena. The court adopted the four factor test developed by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania as to what courts should examine to determine the severity and vitality of a discovery sanction and held that the Commonwealth Court correctly determined that the arbitrator, under the circumstances of the case, violated the procedural due process rights of the city. In particular, the court noted that, regarding the prongs of prejudice and willful misconduct, any prejudice was sufficiently cured by the city's subsequent actions and that no willful misconduct occurred on the part of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that because appellant was granted the right to proceed pro se during the post-verdict phase, he could not successfully &quot;layer&quot; any claims under 42 Pa.C.S &sect; 9543(a)(2)(ii) alleging trial counsel's ineffectiveness that he did not raise in a post-verdict motion. Review of such &quot;layered&quot; claims necessarily required an assessment of whether appellant himself was ineffective for not including the claims in a post-verdict motion. A defendant could not allege his own ineffectiveness or that of standby counsel. Even if counsel were ineffective under U.S. Const. amend. VI for stipulating to the introduction of an autopsy report wherein the doctor opined that the manner of death was homicide, appellant had not shown prejudice. Even in the absence of the stipulation, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to have another medical examiner review the doctor's factual findings and render an opinion as to the cause and manner of death. Moreover, &quot;homicide&quot; referred to any intentional killing of a human except for a suicide; the fact that counsel stipulated that the manner of death was homicide had no bearing on whether the killing was committed in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff obtained a medical malpractice judgment in her favor for the death of her husband as a result of the medical malpractice of two doctors. The doctors' medical malpractice insurer became insolvent, and the PPCIGA assumed its obligations. Plaintiff asserted that the MCARE Fund was the excess carrier under the relevant policies and was responsible for excess liability up to $ 1.2 million for each of the doctors to the extent that the PPCIGA paid less than such amounts. The PPCIGA and the MCARE Fund denied coverage. The issue presented was whether a party challenging the MCARE Fund's coverage determination may bring an action in the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction or whether, as the MCARE Fund asserted, the challenging party must first exhaust administrative remedies by seeking relief with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. The court held that the statutory changes to the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act, 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1303.101-1303.910, were too insignificant to compel it to abandon its prior case law decision that the Commonwealth Court had original jurisdiction over claims against the MCARE Fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), which imposed a sentence of imprisonment for his conviction of, inter alia, first-degree murder. The sentence was based on a sentencing agreement, and the trial court had denied post-sentence relief. The appeal had been transferred from a superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted after a jury trial of first-degree murder and multiple other charges, arising from a fatal stabbing of a bar owner, and he was sentenced to death. His petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546, was denied, but he was granted federal habeas corpus relief as to his penalty-phase claims. The matter was remanded to the trial court for a new penalty hearing. Prior to the rehearing, a sentencing agreement was reached which, inter alia, provided for a life sentence, and such sentences were imposed. However, the inmate challenged the judgment of sentence. The trial court dismissed the motion, finding that the inmate had waived his appellate rights in the agreement. The inmate appealed to the superior court, and the matter was transferred to the court. The court declined to review the appeal on the merits upon finding that the superior court was the proper forum to hear the matter. The sentence under review was life imprisonment, such that the court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711. Rather, as no sentence of death was involved, the superior court had jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 742.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court relinquished jurisdiction and transferred the appeal to the superior court.</SPAN></P>

Appellants each brought personal injury cases, which were consolidated, alleging that their husbands' lung cancer was caused by occupational exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by appellee. Appellants had been substituted as plaintiffs after their husbands died.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants had brought suit against other companies for compensation for claims of nonmalignant asbestos-related disease. Appellants contended that their receipt of compensation from those other companies for claims which arose prior to 1992, while the one disease rule was in effect, did not preclude their subsequent recovery from appellee for damages for lung cancer that was diagnosed after the two disease rule was adopted in Pennsylvania. The court held that the lower court erred in its determination that appellants were precluded from seeking damages from appellee for lung cancer diagnosed after the two disease rule was adopted in the Commonwealth. The court held that case law set forth that the prior recovery of damages for increased risk and fear of developing cancer due to asbestos exposure, awarded under the one disease rule, did not preclude them from recovering, from a party he has not previously sued, damages for cancer that developed and was diagnosed after the separate disease rule, also referred to as the two disease rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In these consolidated cases, the Centre County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) dismissed charges filed by the Commonwealth for violations of the Pennsylvania Trademark Counterfeiting Statute,&nbsp;18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4119, based on the trial court's prior decision striking the statute as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held under &sect; 4119, the use of any items bearing an unauthorized reproduction of terms or words used by a person to identify that person's goods or services was criminalized. Thus, &sect; 4119(a) and (i)&nbsp;unconstitutionally prohibited protected speech, including the use of words on a sign praising or protesting any entity with a trademarked name. The Commonwealth's attempt to apply the limiting phrase &quot;with intent to sell or distribute&quot; to the entire list of verbs in the definition of the offense in &sect; 4119(a) was rejected. The amendment would have applied solely to &quot;possessed.&quot; Further, the constitutionality of the proposed amendatory language could not be considered until it was enacted into law. A default mens rea in 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 302(c) did not speak to what conduct a person had to commit, and did not mention the intent to sell or deceive. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 312 did not save &sect; 4119 as the concern of overbreadth jurisprudence was not only at the risk of prosecution, but also the chilling of speech in fear of prosecution. The statutes of other states cited by the Commonwealth were distinguished. Section 4119 was properly stricken as overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the death of the little girl, whom he was paid to care for, along with her siblings. The Court found that the totality of the evidence amply proved specific intent to kill beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence that showed not only that defendant inflicted a specific blow to the child, but immediate prior abuse, a failure to so much as check on the child after she fell into a radiator after being hit by defendant and slowly suffocated, and defendant forbidding the victim's sister from going to her assistance. The Court also found that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding of the torture aggravator based on the beatings and neglect defendant inflicted upon the victim taking place over the course of months; her suffering sudden and serious weight loss; the months of torture then culminating on the night of the killing, as defendant beat her with an extension cord in a cold shower, then beat her again later that evening, just before throwing her into the radiator with sufficient force to leave indentations in her face and head; then throwing her behind a bed, where she slowly suffocated over the course of several hours.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted on charges involving possession of drugs and criminal conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate counsel had filed a petition to withdraw from representation and an accompanying Anders brief with the Superior Court setting forth the factual history of the entire case and concluding that the appeal was wholly frivolous as there were no meritorious issues to present. The court agreed with the Superior Court that the brief was inadequate, but on different grounds. Namely, the Court found that appellate counsel did not summarize his own review of the record with an eye toward possible appellate issues but, instead, identified two challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence that appellant himself had asked appellate counsel to raise. The Court adjusted its rules prospectively regarding the contents of an Anders brief in Pennsylvania. The court held that in appeals where the briefing notice was issued after the date of the decision in the case at bar, counsel who seek to withdraw on grounds that their clients' appeals are frivolous shall set forth the reasons for that conclusion in the Anders brief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court affirmed the order of the Superior Court, on different grounds, that appellate counsel's brief was inadequate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellant taxpayers challenged the orders of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which determined that their standing in the respective zoning appeals was removed by the enactment of the Home Rule Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13131.1. Appellees, a city, its zoning board, and various entities were parties to the suits that were consolidated since each concerned the interpretation and constitutionality of &sect; 13131.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each case involved a general taxpayer challenging the action of the city's zoning board of adjustment granting a use and/or zoning variance to the various entities, who had applied for the same. The various entities challenged the taxpayers' appeals on the basis that they were not aggrieved persons under &sect; 13131.1. The taxpayers asserted aggrieved party standing under a city ordinance granting them the same. The court found that it was clear that the city's ordinance granting general taxpayer standing must cede to the plain language of &sect; 13131.1. The court found that &sect; 13131.1 clearly defined the parties who have standing to appeal the city's zoning decisions and it specifically excluded taxpayers who are not aggrieved by the decision. The Court held that the provision was directly contrary to the city's zoning code, which granted broader taxpayer standing in zoning appeals, thus, &sect; 13131.1 took precedence and controlled. As a result, the orders of the Commonwealth Court properly determined that the taxpayers were not aggrieved parties in their respective challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, landowners of servient estates, sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania) which reversed the trial court's finding that a railroad right-of-way had been abandoned and that the servient estates were therefore no longer subject to an easement where the right-of-way had been transferred to appellee &quot;rails-to-trails&quot; organization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former holder of the contested right-of-way obtained permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon rail service on the right-of-way, after which it entered into an agreement with appellee Conservancy to convey the right-of-way to an organization nominated by the Conservancy. The Conservancy nominated the rails-to-trails organization to receive the right-of-way. The right-of-way was conveyed by quitclaim deed. The former holder of the railway turned over responsibility for maintenance of road crossings and bridges on the right-of-way to the rails to trails organization, the Conservancy, and the County. The essence of the dispute was whether an effort to railbank a railroad right-of-way via the private railbanking process could be effective if the railroad did not agree to be bound to resuscitate service if directed to do so at a later date. The appellate court held that the manner of railbanking at issue was effective and a railbanking did result. Accordingly, the landowners' claim that the right-of-way was abandoned, and the easement over their land extinguished, was without merit.</SPAN></P>

When officers arrived, they observed he smelled of alcohol, had glassy, bloodshot eyes, and slurred speech. He was arrested; a blood test revealed that his blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.233 percent. He argued that the BAC test constituted a &quot;critical stage&quot; at which the right to counsel attached, and that he was denied that right. The issue was whether U.S. Const. amend. VI and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 provided a right to counsel before refusing to submit to chemical testing when such refusal would subject the DUI suspect to imprisonment pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3804(c). The high court held that defendant's circumstances did not trigger the right to counsel because, although he was under arrest, no criminal complaint had been filed, and the adversarial judicial proceedings had yet to begin. As this was not a &quot;critical stage&quot; under Pennsylvania's jurisprudence, the right did not attach.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. II, &sect; 8 and art. VII, &sect; 14. The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court dismissed 13 counts and granted appellees' application for judgment on the pleadings on the remaining count. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Art. II, &sect; 8 provided that a legislator could not receive any increase of salary or mileage under any law passed during the term for which he or she was elected. The trial court held that none of appellant's challenges stated a claim for relief. The high court agreed. Cost of living adjustments received by legislators pursuant to 65 Pa. Stat. Ann &sect; 366.4 were &quot;salary&quot; for purposes of art. II, &sect; 8 and were fixed and predetermined in the Pennsylvania Compensation Law. The expenses received by legislators that appellant complained of were authorized by &sect; 366.4(a), and reimbursing them for such expenses, even if they were unvouchered, was constitutional. The legislators' insurance, pension, and other benefits did not fall within the prohibition expressed by art. I, &sect; 8. The high court rejected appellant's claim that accumulations in the leadership accounts violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14, which required surplus operating funds to be appropriated during the next fiscal year. As these &quot;continuing appropriations&quot; were committed and did not lapse at the close of the fiscal year, they were not a &quot;surplus&quot; that was available for appropriation during the next fiscal year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained a search warrant for defendant's personal computer and seized the computer from his residence. The computer contained images of suspected child pornography and images that were known to be child pornography. A jury convicted defendant of violating &sect; 6312(d). The supreme court held that accessing and viewing child pornography over the internet constituted &quot;control&quot; of such pornography under &sect; 6312(d). Under &sect; 6312(d), a defendant could be convicted of sexual abuse of children for the mere knowing control of child pornography. An individual manifested knowing control of child pornography when he purposefully searched it out on the internet and intentionally viewed it on his computer. Under the statute, the Commonwealth did not have to show that a defendant possessed child pornography to prove a violation of &sect; 6312(d) if it could prove that a defendant knowingly controlled child pornography. Section 6312(d)(1) employed the disjunctive &quot;knowingly possessed or controlled.&quot; Therefore, it was reasonable to conclude that the General Assembly employed the terms &quot;possession&quot; and &quot;control&quot; in the disjunctive purposefully and that they were meant to have different applications.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 1513 imposed upon a class of individuals affiliated with licensed gaming in Pennsylvania an absolute ban on political contributions. The court first noted that the Commonwealth did not dispute that the appropriate constitutional test was strict scrutiny. Furthermore, for purposes of &sect; 7, political contributions were a form of nonverbal, protected expression. While the ban on political contributions here did further the compelling state interest in avoiding the appearance of corruption in the oversight of the gaming industry, however, &sect; 1513 was not narrowly tailored. Banning all contributions was not a narrowly drawn means of furthering a policy of negating the corrupting effect and appearance of large contributions. It totally banned a protected form of political expression and association which was unrelated to the identified interest, and did so despite the availability of more narrowly tailored restrictions. The obvious disconnection between the articulated interest and the means chosen rendered the absolute ban on campaign contributions constitutionally infirm under &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), in a case where appellee property owners sued appellant county over use of a base-year property tax assessment system the owners believed caused property taxes to be assessed in the county in violation of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1's Uniformity Clause, entered a judgment that found the system was facially unconstitutional. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court ultimately ordered in a property tax case that a comprehensive countywide assessment be completed by a certain time for use in an upcoming tax year. The county performed an annual reassessment. An implementing ordinance was then amended to provide that the assessment for that year would be used as a base-year to calculate property taxes in the future. No reassessment occurred. The owners sued to challenge use of the base-year formula to calculate the property tax assessment and claimed it violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The trial court found that the base-year assessment system was facially unconstitutional and that the county had to reassess property on an annual basis. The state supreme court found that the base-year assessment system was not facially unconstitutional, but was unconstitutional as applied because it did not consider real estate valuation changes, which meant that the property valuations were less accurate as time passed. It also found that the trial court would need on remand to determine how often the reassessments should occur to make property valuations constitutionally uniform.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court agreed that the current base-year assessment system of property taxation was unconstitutional, but disagreed that it was facially unconstitutional; rather, it found more narrowly that it was unconstitutional as applied because use of a base-year caused inaccuracies and a lack of uniformity over time. It then found reassessment was required and remanded the case to the trial court to determine how it should be accomplished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, alleging that his transfer from one prison facility to another prison facility by appellees, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and its superintendent, in his official capacity, was done in retaliation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate escaped from a prison detail with the cooperation from a prison volunteer. After the inmate was recaptured, he was incarcerated at a prison. While there, the inmate and other prisoners filed a lawsuit, alleging that the prison's telephone service provider overcharged them. While the suit was pending, the inmate held private conversations with a different prison volunteer, who revealed personal information. Upon learning of these events, the Department recommended the inmate's transfer, noting that his previous escape was consummated with the assistance of a prison volunteer, and reasoning the developing close relationship with another volunteer created an escape risk. The inmate was transferred to another prison. On appeal, the court found that administrative prisoner transfers were presumed to further a legitimate penological objective unless a prisoner proved otherwise. Further, there was highly relevant temporal proximity between the events constituting the Department's grounds for the transfer and the decision to transfer the inmate. Thus, the inmate failed to demonstrate that his transfer was due to retaliation by prison officials for his institution of the lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth gave notice of its intent to seek the death penalty, based on a single aggravating circumstance: murder committed while in the perpetration of a felony. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the aggravating circumstance. However, the appellate court found that, as defendant was tried and convicted of first-degree murder and felony theft, the jury found that defendant killed the victim while in the perpetration of a felony. Any claims of inadequacy with respect to pre-trial matters were rendered moot by the verdict which confirmed the existence of the aggravating circumstance. Defendant made no challenge to the guilty verdict on the theft charge or its finding of the aggravating circumstance. Defendant failed to cite any cases in support of her constitutional claims. Defendant failed to raise in the trial court her claim relating to allegations concerning her criminal state of mind. Defendant pointed to no error at the penalty hearing. Essentially, she asked the appellate court to substitute its judgment for the jury's, which the appellate court was not authorized to do. The jury's verdict was not triggered by an improper factor.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, defendant was found guilty of six counts of criminal contempt and was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of two months and 28 days to five months and 29 days on each count.

While the superior court based its decision on 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4136(b), which specified the punishment for an indirect criminal contempt could not exceed 15 days in prison, that provision was unconstitutional as the court had the exclusive rule-making authority to establish rules of procedure under Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) vacated the Department of Banking's  approval of a credit union's proposal to charter itself as a community-based credit union, because the Department did not comply with 10 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 3.6, 3.4(b), hold evidentiary hearings, or provide protesting banks access to the hearing file.  The credit union and the Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that 10 Pa. Code ch. 3 did not apply because credit unions were not 10 Pa. Code &sect; 3.1 institutions and that they could not file a 10 Pa. Code &sect; 3.2(b) application. The court agreed. 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733-2(A) defined the term &quot;institution&quot; as a corporation, person, or mutual holding company, but not credit unions unless specifically stated otherwise. 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 102 excluded credit unions from the definition of &quot;institution.&quot; Under either of these definitions, a credit union was not an &quot;institution&quot; (within the meaning of the Department's regulations) and could not have filed an &quot;application,&quot; thereby removing the case  from the scope of 10 Pa. Code ch. 3. Although the banks complied with 17 Pa.C.S. &sect; 501(g) by filing a timely notice of protest, the protest was fatally flawed because it was filed pursuant to 10 Pa. Code ch. 3. The banks waived any due process right to a hearing pursuant to 2 Pa.C.S. &sect; 504 because the issue was not timely raised. The holding in Conestoga did not apply because the banks did not establish standing. The court held that it was error to declare 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733-302&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the commonwealth court and remanded the cases for further proceedings consistent with the opinion and to address the alternative constitutional argument that the non-disclosure provision impermissibly restricted the banks' right to engage in public debate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence and two traffic offenses. Defendant's suppression motion was granted by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which concluded that the Fourth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 required probable cause to stop a vehicle for an alleged traffic violation, and that 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6308 was unconstitutional. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that Terry stops based on reasonable suspicion were allowed to secure such other information as a police officer reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce the provisions of &sect; 6308(b). A modification of &sect; 6308 merely eliminated the statutory requirement of a greater level of information for a stop under the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code than was constitutionally required for all other stops. Section 6308(b) was not unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The text of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 did not require probable cause to make a vehicle stop. Since the Fourth Amendment and &sect; 8 were coterminous for Terry purposes, and the Fourth Amendment allowed for an investigative detention in the form of a vehicle stop, &sect; 8 allowed for a vehicle stop based on reasonable suspicion. Prior caselaw did not hold that &sect; 8 required a vehicle stop to be supported by probable cause. The Pennsylvania legislature determined the reasonable suspicion standard adequately balanced citizens' privacy in a vehicle and law enforcement's ability to briefly investigate an alleged violation of the Code. Section 6308(b) was constitutional under the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine if the police officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant was tried for capital murder prior to the effective date of the new rule that all waived claims were not available for review in the first instance on direct appeal, he filed his notice of appeal on well after the effective date of the new rule. The trial court correctly determined that no violation of the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5704, occurred. There was no basis to conclude that the privacy rights of defendant or his parents were infringed when their telephone conversation was recorded while defendant was an inmate of the county jail. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's request to present the testimony of the chief psychiatrist at the Allegheny County Behavior Clinic at the penalty phase.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner filed a class action against appellees, the state agency and its administrator, in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, to challenge the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's Disposition of Abandoned and Unclaimed Property Act of 1982 (DAUPA), 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1301.1 - 1301.29, and to recover damages and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court dismissed the complaint. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state agency took possession of shares of common stock in a company as abandoned and/or unclaimed property, pursuant to the DAUPA, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;1301.6 (amended 2002). The agency later sold this stock, under authority provided in 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1301.17, and appropriated the money, earned interest, and other appreciation for public purposes pursuant to 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1301.18. The owner filed a claim with the agency asserting ownership of the stock and seeking recovery of its proceeds. The claim was granted. The owner asserted that the state agency committed a taking without just compensation, under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, when it denied the owner's request for interest earned during the time the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania held the owner's property pursuant to the DAUPA. On appeal, the court found that the owner had no claim to the interest earned while the abandoned property was held in perpetual temporary custody of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The DAUPA procedures resulted not from a taking by overt act of the Commonwealth, but were triggered by the neglect of the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth challenged an order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the decision of a trial court to grant defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained during a stop at a sobriety checkpoint. Defendant argued that his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 were violated because the checkpoint was not conducted in accordance with the Tarbert-Blouse guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sergeant and police officers established a sobriety checkpoint. An officer stopped defendant's vehicle at the checkpoint and administered field sobriety tests upon him. Defendant failed the tests and was charged with two driving under the influence offenses. The supreme court held that the procedure used did not violate the Tarbert-Blouse proscription against placing unfettered discretion with the on-site officers as to which vehicles to stop at the checkpoint. On-site police officers could exercise their discretion to suspend temporarily the operation of a sobriety checkpoint because of traffic back-up that created unreasonable delay or safety concerns. When the checkpoint was in operation every vehicle was stopped to allow the officers to briefly observe the driver. Only when the traffic volume became heavy and the resulting back-up caused an unreasonable delay did the sergeant temporarily suspend operation of the checkpoint and allow every vehicle to pass through unimpeded. There was no allegation that the officers based the decision as to when to suspend or when to resume operation of the checkpoint on the characteristics or actions of any particular vehicle or driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the order and remanded the case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Superior Court, affirming the judgment of sentence of the court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, following a plea of nolo contender to a sexual offender charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to a sexual offender charge, he was informed that under the version of Megan's Law in effect at the time the crime was committed, he would be subject to registration as a sexual offender for ten years.  However, the Superior Court determined that the lifetime registration requirement of the current version of Megan's Law, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1(b)(2) applied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Megan's Law registration requirements, of whatever duration, were matters collateral to and not direct consequences of defendant's plea. The registration requirements were not a criminal penalty and were a civil requirement over which the sentencing judge had no control. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.3 plainly stated that the sentencing court, not the trial court accepting a plea, was the adjudicatory body that was to inform the sexual offender of the duty to register. Thus, the trial court was not obligated to advise defendant as to the length of the registration requirement, and any misunderstanding as to the duration of that requirement was not a basis for a post-sentence withdrawal of defendant's plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former county elected officials, challenged a decision of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which, pursuant to Pennsylvania's Shield Law, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5942, reversed the trial court's order compelling appellees, two newspapers and a reporter, to disclose a confidential source.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials testified before a grand jury. The newspapers published front-page stories accusing the officials of &quot;stonewalling&quot; the grand jury. The articles attributed information to an unnamed source close to the investigation. The officials sued appellees for defamation and sought disclosure of the unnamed source. The trial court granted the request, finding that the Shield Law had to give way to the need to enforce and protect the foundation of the purpose of the grand jury. The superior court reversed. On appeal, the officials argued that the Shield Law should not protect appellees from disclosure because the communication between the reporter and her alleged source violated the Grand Jury Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4549(b), and thus constituted a criminal act. In affirming the superior court's decision, the court rejected the invitation to fashion a non-textual, crime-fraud exception to the operation of the Shield Law because such an exception would not only contradict the well-established public policy underlying the Shield Law, but would contravene the Shield Law's unambiguous text.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a former state senator and representative, sought review of an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which granted summary relief under Pa.R.A.P. 1532(b) to appellees, the governor and certain member of his administration, in appellants' action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief regarding gubernatorial vetoes of &sect;&sect; 219, 223, 801, and 2010 of the General Appropriation Act of 2005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that the challenged vetoes were null and void as Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 allegedly did not permit the governor to disapprove of language -- as opposed to amounts appropriated -- in the appropriation bill. The lower court determined that prior case law indicated that &sect; 16 permitted the governor to disapprove of either the amount of an appropriation or the purpose for which the money was appropriated or both. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court focused on the meaning of the term &quot;item&quot; in &sect; 16. Utilizing Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 as the context, the phrase &quot;item(s) of any bill making appropriations of money&quot; was used to distinguish the type of bill to which the constitution was referring in comparison with &sect; 15, which involved general legislation. Thus, the court concluded that &quot;item&quot; in &sect; 16 was a sum of money directed by the General Assembly to be spent for a particular purpose. Based on that conclusion, because &sect; 2010 did not include a subject connected to an amount and &sect;&sect; 219 and 223 involved restrictions on the discretion of state agencies, those sections were improperly vetoed by the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order to the extent it upheld the vetoes of language in &sect;&sect; 219, 223, and 2010 of the Act. The court affirmed that part of the order that upheld the veto of the language in &sect; 801.</SPAN></P>

Laws 83, No. 20 (Act 20), which retroactively amended 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7106 to permit the collection of attorney's fees in tax claim cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers had failed to pay school taxes for a number of years, and the tax claim was secured by liens on their property. The law firm was retained to collect the delinquent taxes. Attorney's fees were added to the total tax claim. After a decision in another case disallowing the imposition of attorney's fees incident to tax claims prior to the amendment of the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act (MCTLA), 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7101 et seq., the taxpayers filed the instant action. The taxpayers claimed that Act 20, allowing collection of attorney's fees in such a case, violated the Remedies Clause, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. On appeal, the court reversed to the extent a Remedies Clause violation was found. In interpreting Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the court determined that it had been invoked when a statutory or common law cause of action for an injury had been altered or eliminated in full by the legislature. Although the taxpayers claimed that they would be deprived of a vested right in the nature of a defense, the constitutional protection was for a remedy for an injury done; instead, the taxpayers' claim was for a right not to do something, specifically to pay attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the commonwealth court's decision in part and reinstated the grant of partial summary judgment entered by the trial court in favor of the law firm; the court remanded the action to the trial court for further proceedings, including the determination of a reasonable attorney's fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant advanced an insanity defense. Two expert witnesses agreed on a diagnosis, but differed on whether defendant was legally insane. The Commonwealth's expert testified that defendant was, at the time of his offenses, &quot;mentally ill&quot; under the definition set forth in 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 314 because he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The appellate court found that the sole contest initiated by defendant at trial to the jury charge on this issue was limited to his assertion that the burden in connection with a guilty-but-mentally-ill verdict should have been assigned to the Commonwealth on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court disagreed. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 314(a) did not impose a burden of proof concerning an accused's mental illness on either party, but rather, was implicated where an insanity defense failed but evidence of mental illness nevertheless preponderated. This approach did not remove the burden from the Commonwealth of establishing each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden did not need to be assigned to the Commonwealth to prove defendant's mental illness beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which denied a request by the Commonwealth for an order to compel the administration of antipsychotic medication to appellee inmate to determine if the inmate chose to proceed with a request for postconviction relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had received three consecutive death sentences on murder convictions. Subsequently, an attorney, who had not been retained by the inmate, filed a petition under the Act; the attorney asserted that the inmate was not presently competent. The inmate was examined by a psychiatrist for the Commonwealth and a psychologist for the defense and determined to be mentally incompetent. However, the lower court denied the request of the Commonwealth for the administration of antipsychotic medication because allegedly no evidence was presented that the inmate was a danger to himself or others. On appeal, the court reversed. The court concluded that the four-part test in Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003), did not have to be applied as the instant case did not involve a question of whether the inmate was competent to stand trial; the Commonwealth was not required to meet the four strict Sell conditions because it was not seeking an end that was against the inmate's interest. However, because the parties assumed that the four-factor test applied, the court tracked that analysis, finding that the Commonwealth met all four factors, and weighed the distinction in the balance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's denial of the Commonwealth's request to compel antipsychotic medication and remanded for further proceedings. If the medication rendered the inmate competent, the lower court was to determine if the inmate wished to proceed with the petition and, if so, whether the inmate could assist counsel. If the inmate was not rendered competent, the lower court was to consider whether the petition should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth sought to overturn the award of a new penalty hearing based upon a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the victim, a truck driver. At the pre-trial stage, the public defender was permitted to withdraw. The trial court appointed new counsel subject to a $ 3,500 fee cap and, apparently, a $ 500 limitation on available reimbursement for investigative services. The trial court also rescheduled trial, which commenced 22 days later. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced defendant's confession and testimony from various witnesses. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the PCRA court's findings were supported by the evidence and free from legal error. Capital counsel had an obligation to pursue all reasonable avenues for developing mitigating evidence. Given the information available, counsel should have considered the development and presentation of mental-health mitigation at the penalty phase of trial. While the pretrial proceedings were unusual, irregularity, did not necessarily arise to a constitutional violation. The PCRA court did not find that the judge directed a specific and/or irrevocable trial date, and the appellate court did not believe that such finding was inescapable on the present record.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 5, and 6, and federal constitutional law. The credit unions, banking department, and revenue department filed preliminary objections. The appellate court, as an administrative review court, partly overruled and partly sustained the objections. The banking association and banks appealed those rulings only as to Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 5. The state supreme court found that (1) the appeal of the banking association and banks was interlocutory, (2) the rulings below did not declare all rights, and left the banking association and banks with avenues for relief, and (3) not allowing the appeal to go forward promoted the policy of avoiding piecemeal litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was convicted of, inter alia, possession of a controlled substance and sentenced in May 2001, appellant's counsel failed to file post-sentence motions. Appellant's appeal from the judgment of sentence was quashed as untimely in May 2003 as Pa. R. Crim. P. 720(A)(1) only permitted a written post-sentence motion to toll the time period for the filing of a notice of appeal. In February 2004, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546; relief on the merits was denied. The lower court quashed the appeal from that decision, citing a lack of jurisdiction based on the timing requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545(b). On further appeal, the court affirmed. The plain language of the PCRA in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545(b)(3) allowed a postconviction petition to be filed within one year of the expiration of the time for seeking review; thus, the petition should have been filed in June 2002. Despite the alleged ineffectiveness of appellant's counsel, a statement in existing case law that the one-year period could commence 30 days after an appeal was quashed as untimely was dictum; no generalized equitable exception to the time bar existed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted by a jury of first degree murder and related charges. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal.

The court noted that ineffective assistance of counsel claims were distinct from those claims raised on direct appeal and were to be treated as wholly independent of the underlying claim of error with regard to a PCRA petition. However, the court found that defendant's claims that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and present expert medical testimony establishing his borderline personality disorder and his crack-cocaine addiction and intoxication at the time of the offense were all claims addressed on direct appeal and, therefore, were meritless. Further, the voluntariness of his confession that was admitted at trial and any purported prosecutorial misconduct, and the relation of those claims to defendant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, were also issues addressed on direct appeal. Ultimately, the court addressed each argument and found that they were either previously litigated or meritless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), entered a judgment that denied defendant's petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9541 et seq. That denial came after a jury had found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, defendant had been sentenced to death, and that sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal.

Defendant was eventually sentenced to death. After the sentence was affirmed on direct appeal, defendant's petition for post conviction relief was denied. The state supreme court found defendant could obtain post conviction relief if he could show that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue claims of trial counsel's ineffectiveness, which was known as a &quot;layered claim.&quot; The state supreme court then found to preserve such a claim, the three-part Pierce test had to be met. It found that defendant adequately pled appellate counsel's ineffectiveness for not raising trial counsel's ineffectiveness, but did not show appellate counsel had no reasonable basis for pursuing the claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness and that but for appellate counsel's ineffectiveness, the direct appeal result would have been different. The state supreme court then found that since all of defendant's underlying claims of trial counsel's ineffectiveness failed, his claims of appellate counsel's ineffectiveness failed as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate, who had been sentenced to death, filed a petition against appellee Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541 - 9546. The Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division of Erie County (Pennsylvania) denied the petition as untimely under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate based his petition on the court's decision in Rizzuto, which held that where a mitigating circumstance was presented to a jury by stipulation, the jury was required to find that mitigating factor. The inmate argued that the time-bar exception in &sect; 9545(b)(1)(iii) applied because he had filed his petition within 60 days after Rizzuto was decided. The PCRA court dismissed the petition on the ground that because Rizzuto neither recognized a new constitutional right nor directed that its holding should be applied retroactively, &sect; 9545(b)(1)(iii) did not apply. The court agreed. Although Rizzuto created a new rule of law, the court had not held that new rule to be constitutional in nature, and clearly that ruling was based on interpretation of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711. Furthermore, the court had not held that Rizzuto applied retroactively. The inmate's direct appeal was exhausted 30 days after it was decided on March 18, 1991, the time within which he could have filed a certiorari petition, and thus was not pending when Rizzuto was decided in 2001. Thus, he was not entitled to retroactive application of Rizzuto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court (Pennsylvania) entered an order that found the question of whether separated crimes constituted separate criminal transactions for the purpose of sentencing under the three-strikes sentencing provision of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714(a)(2) was one of law and fell within the province of the court. Defendant petitioned to appeal his claim that 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714 was unconstitutional and the state supreme court granted limited review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a trial, defendant was convicted of, inter alia, kidnapping. At the sentencing hearing, the parties stipulated that official court records would reveal his two prior first-degree felony convictions of robbery. Also, the Commonwealth provided certified court records indicating defendant had been sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison for yet another first-degree felony robbery conviction. The trial court then sentenced defendant to life in prison upon conviction of kidnapping pursuant to the mandatory sentencing provision of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714. That provision allowed the trial court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, the previous convictions of the offender. Defendant unsuccessfully argued on appeal that 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714 was unconstitutional. The state supreme court found that a trial court could determine whether separate crimes involved separate criminal transactions for three strikes sentencing under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714 since that inquiry involved an examination of official court records and was similar to a trial court being allowed under Apprendi to determine the fact of prior convictions in order to enhance sentencing beyond the statutory maximum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the UTPCPL did not apply to an attorney's conduct in collecting and distributing settlement proceeds. Application of the UTPCPL to such conduct would violate the separation of powers doctrine and would encroach upon the state's highest court's exclusive power under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c) to regulate the practice of law in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania General Assembly had no authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution to regulate the conduct of lawyers in the practice of law. Any application of the UTPCPL to the collection and distribution of settlement proceeds would purport to regulate the conduct of attorneys. The Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct and Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement exclusively addressed the conduct complained of, specifically Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(c), 1.15(b), 8.4(b), and 8.4(c) and Pa.R.D.E. 514. These rules provided the exclusive remedy for the complained of attorney misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that &sect; 1506 expressly provided that only those orders or determinations or decisions that were &quot;final&quot; were appealable. The Gaming Act did not define &quot;final.&quot; The court held that a final decision was an order, decision, or determination on a zoning issue involving a licensed facility that was conclusive and appealable under a political subdivision's zoning provisions. This construction of &sect; 1506 was consistent with and advanced the General Assembly's intent in the Gaming Act to preserve a political subdivision's authority to zone and subject the development of licensed facilities to local zoning regulations. The Notice of Refusal of the permit application here was not conclusive and appealable under the City's zoning ordinances. This was because the Philadelphia Code provided for yet another step in the permit application process, a review by and decision from the Zoning Hearing Board on the Department's denial of the permit. Accordingly, the court did not have jurisdiction over the applicant's petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objections filed by an administrator of a decedent's estate to a second-class township's taking of a farm were overruled. The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court (intermediate court) affirmed. The owner was granted a limited review as to whether the ruling was in error, and whether the Pennsylvania Open Space Lands Act (Lands Act), 32 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5008, imposed any limitations on the exercise of eminent domain by second-class townships.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the township had the authority to condemn property under the Pennsylvania Second-Class Township Code, 23 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67201, for any legitimate recreational purpose, even though the Lands Act did not extend the authority to the township to take for open space purposes. However, the true purpose in taking the farm was not recreation. The township's open space plan discussed the farm in terms of its agricultural and open space value. The options considered by the township for the farm did not support the taking. Under the Fifth Amendment, the owner could not be allowed to continue to farm the land as a condemnation had to serve a public purpose. The taking of 175 acres to allow the township to create a second entrance to a neighboring park if the township decided that in the future it would like to reinstitute a town celebration there was excessive. The township had not created a plan for the use of the farm for passive recreation purposes. The township wanted to acquire the farm to preserve it as open space in order to prevent its development. The taking was outside the township's authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate court's order was reversed. The matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. Jurisdiction was relinquished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All of appellant's claims alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The supreme court found that appellant failed to develop the requisite prejudice at the guilt-phase of his capital murder trial by counsel's failure to investigate the licensing status of the victim's firearm, and thus failed to prove that trial counsel was ineffective pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9546(d) of the PCRA. Appellant's mere assertion that the victim's possession of an unlicensed firearm established criminal conduct on the victim's part would not only fall far short of the standards for a permissive inference, but would have almost no probative value to appellant's self-defense claim. Appellant's claim  that counsel's failure to provide his psychologist with various records in a timely fashion prevented the psychologist from testifying effectively to certain mitigating factors was unsupported. While the psychologist noted that the information would have provided outside confirmation of appellant's drug-use history and further details of it, the psychologist did not state that the evidence would have changed the diagnosis he expressed in a report or to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the taking of appellee condemnee's property due to its blighted condition was legitimate, and it refused to entertain any argument regarding whether the subsequent transfer of the property to a developer that was a religious entity violated the Establishment Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record did not support a bad faith claim against the redevelopment authority. Therefore, what remained was a review of whether the taking of the property violated the Establishment Clause. The secular purpose in the redevelopment authority's taking of the property was but another in a series of steps taken to eliminate blight, as established in the Urban Redevelopment Act. The elimination of blight was a valid public purpose that, in the absence of bad faith, was completely separate from any religious use of the property subsequent to the taking. The principal or primary effect of the taking was to eliminate blight in the neighborhood. While the religious nature of the school to be built on the property was reason for the court's careful review, the facts indicated no goal aside from the elimination of blight and did not provide any indication that the principal or primary effect would be to advance religion. The exercise of eminent domain to eliminate blight was a valid public purpose, and the subsequent sale of the property to a religious entity did not constitute &quot;entanglement&quot; that made the taking unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent that the commonwealth court found it necessary to overrule what it believed to be the trial court's finding of waiver for the condemnee's failure to challenge the certification of blight, the court affirmed. In all other respects, the court reversed and remanded to the commonwealth court for a determination of any outstanding issues consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) entered a judgment that determined petitioner taxpayer had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action regarding an audit of the General Assembly's financial accounts, but which concluded that no constitutional or statutory authority existed that the Auditor General had the power to audit those accounts. The taxpayer appealed and respondent senators cross-appealed the standing ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer petitioned for review in the Commonwealth Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Auditor General had the authority to audit the General Assembly's financial accounts. The senators responded by claiming, inter alia, that the taxpayer lacked standing to bring such an action. The Commonwealth Court initially determined that the taxpayer possessed the requirements for taxpayer standing. It ultimately concluded, however, that the taxpayer failed to provide either constitutional or statutory authority supporting the position that the Auditor General can, and must, audit the General Assembly. The taxpayer appealed the ruling against him. The senators cross-appealed the standing determination. The state supreme court found that it was not necessary to consider the Auditor General's authority because the taxpayer lacked standing to bring the action. The state supreme court applied the five-factor Biester taxpayer standing test and concluded that the taxpayer did not meet the fifth factor, that no other persons were better suited to assert the claim, because the Auditor General could in his discretion file such a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayer filed an action against appellant taxing authorities in which the taxpayer sought a refund under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5566b of ad valorem taxes it had paid on oil and gas reserves that remained in the ground. The trial court granted the taxing authorities' motion for summary judgment. The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) reversed. The taxing authorities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2002, the present court held that 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5020-201(a) precluded counties from collecting taxes on oil and gas reserves that remained in the ground. The taxpayer argued that the decision should apply retroactively. The court noted that it had previously held that a decision striking down a state tax on constitutional grounds applied prospectively only. Accordingly, the 2002 holding, based on statutory interpretation, should also apply prospectively. This holding was buttressed by application of the Chevron test. The 2002 decision established a new principle of law, and applying it retroactively would not forward the operation of the decision. The equities weighed heavily in favor of prospective-only application, as the taxing authorities had collected and used the taxes with the good faith belief that they were legally entitled to them. Requiring a refund would cause substantial financial hardship to the communities involved. Because the 2002 decision had prospective application only, the taxing authorities were entitled to the taxes prior to that decision, and no refund was warranted under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5566b.</SPAN></P>
