Stat. &sect; 12-730; [2]-Income from stock options in later years was properly taxed under Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 12-711(b)-18(a), as the regulation was properly interpreted to require taxation from a TP who performed services in Connecticut at any point during the taxable year in which the options were granted or exercised; [3]-There was no due process violation by the taxation based on satisfaction of the two-pronged test.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct during his cross-examination and the closing argument. The high court held that the prosecutor improperly insinuated that defendant had started the fight, as this was not based on reasonable inferences from the facts. Her statements that defendant acted as the victim's &quot;judge, jury and executioner,&quot; and that, if the jurors believed his testimony, she had a &quot;bog in Ireland&quot; she would like to sell them, were also improper. However, these improper statements did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, as defense counsel's failure to object to them indicated that counsel did not regard them as seriously prejudicial, and the state's case was strong. An instruction regarding defendant's interest in the outcome of the case was proper as it was not unduly repetitive and did not transcend the bounds of evenhandedness. But in the future, courts should refrain from instructing jurors, when a defendant testified, that they could consider his interest in the outcome of the trial and its importance to him.</SPAN></P>

The Appellate Court remanded the matter with directions to merge two possession of narcotics convictions, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21a-278(b) and 21a-277(a), and to vacate the sentence on the conviction of possession of narcotics with intent to sell (PNIS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with multiple drug possession offenses. After a jury trial, he was convicted of violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21a-278(b), 21a-277(a), and 21a-267. The trial court imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment on the PNIS convictions. The Appellate Court concluded that defendant was sentenced for both a greater and lesser included offense that arose from the same transaction, which ran afoul of the prohibition against double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V. Applying the merger of convictions approach, it directed that the PNIS convictions were to be merged, and that the sentence on the lesser offense under &sect; 21a-277 was to be vacated. On further review, the court exercised its inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice rather than relying on amend. V. It found that the proper remedy for defendant's convictions of greater and lesser included offenses was to vacate the conviction for the lesser included offense rather than merge it. The court accordingly overruled State v. Chicano, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), to the extent that it applied the merger of convictions approach for a defendant convicted of greater and lesser included offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The town's rescue personnel responded to an accident. In doing so, they parked the town's fire truck across two lanes of an interstate highway. Shortly thereafter, the injured motorist, who had been driving his automobile on the interstate highway, collided with the parked fire truck. The injured motorist and spouse sued, inter alia, the town and claimed the fire truck was a nuisance. The town moved to strike. The trial court granted the motion based on the appellate court's Himmelstein decision. The appellate court reversed. The state supreme court found that Himmelstein could be distinguished. It so concluded because it found that recovery by the injured motorist and spouse was not barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557n(a)(1) that limited claims involving damages arising out of a defective road or bridge filed against a municipality to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-149, the municipal highway defect statute. It then explained that the injured motorist and spouse had not alleged the roadway at issue was one which the town was obligated to keep in repair since it was an interstate highway and, thus, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-149 did not provide the exclusive means of recovery for them.</SPAN></P>

The Connecticut Appellate Court it reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for defendants. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A patron consumed several alcoholic drinks at the restaurant, but no one saw him exhibiting any obvious physical signs of intoxication. As he was driving the decedent home, he caused an auto accident in which the decedent was killed. The patron had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.187 shortly after the accident. Plaintiff's expert opined that the patron would have had to have consumed between 15-20 drinks to have reached that BAC. The intermediate appellate court held that 1) plaintiff had the burden to prove the patron was visibly or otherwise perceivably intoxicated at the time he was sold liquor, and 2) as plaintiff failed to meet that burden, defendants were entitled to judgment in their favor. The high court agreed with the first holding, but not the second. As plaintiff's failure to present evidence of the patron's visible or perceivable intoxication was due to the trial court's pretrial ruling that this evidence was not required, plaintiff had to be afforded an opportunity to produce such evidence at a new trial. He had to prove only that signs of intoxication could have been observed, not that they would have been obvious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was accused of assaulting his former girlfriends in two separate incidents; the cases were consolidated. After a jury trial in the Superior Court, Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), he was convicted of third-degree assault, first-degree assault, first-degree violation of the conditions of release, and two counts of violating a protective order; he pled guilt to being a persistent dangerous felony offender. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Both girlfriends testified that defendant punched them in the face; girlfriend two sustained multiple facial fractures. He argued that his conviction in the second case of first-degree assault with respect to girlfriend two had to be reversed because the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a fist could be a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; The high court agreed. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-3(7) and 53a-59(a)(1), a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; was limited to tools and implements that were external to, and separate and apart from, the perpetrator's body. As defendant's fists alone caused girlfriend two's facial fractures, there was insufficient evidence to prove he committed first-degree assault. The high court could not modify the conviction to the lesser included offense of second-degree assault, as there had been no jury charge regarding that offense. Joinder of the two cases did not deny defendant his right to a fair trial under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as 1) his alleged conduct was the same in both cases--punching young women in the face; 2) his alleged conduct in the second case was not &quot;shocking&quot;; and 3) some evidence was admissible in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment in the second case was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment of acquittal on all counts in that case. The judgment in the first case was affirmed, but the sentence was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court with direction to resentence defendant in accordance with the high court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Windham (Connecticut) which granted the State's petition for an order of continued commitment pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c). Defendant had been under the jurisdiction of the psychiatric security review board pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-582 following his acquittal by reason of mental disease or defect of kidnapping in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Approximately one year before the end of defendant's 25-year term, the State petitioned for continued commitment, arguing that he remained mentally ill and that his discharge from the jurisdiction of the board would constitute a danger to himself or others. The trial court ordered that defendant be committed to the jurisdiction of the board for an additional three years. Defendant's principal claim was that &sect; 17a-593, which set out the continued commitment procedure that was applicable to insanity acquittees, violated his federal constitutional right to equal protection. The appellate court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 17a-593 was unconstitutional as applied to him because subjecting defendant to a recommitment procedure that tilted more strongly in favor of commitment than did its civil counterpart substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental interest of protecting society. It also comported with common sense to conclude that someone whose mental illness was sufficient to lead him to commit a dangerous crime and had persisted despite years of intensive treatment, was someone whose prospective release raised a special concern for public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff Republican Party of Connecticut brought a declaratory judgment action to determine that, because its candidate for the office of governor in the last election received the highest number of votes under the designation of the Republican Party line on the ballot, defendant Secretary of the State was required to list the Republican Party candidate first on the ballots for the current election pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Secretary of the State contended that the Republican Party was required pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-176 to request from the Secretary of the State a declaratory ruling on the meaning and proper application of &sect; 9-249a before the Republican Party could bring an action in the trial court. The Supreme Court of Connecticut held that, prior to bringing an action in the trial court, the Republican Party was required to exhaust its administrative remedies by requesting a declaratory ruling from the Secretary of the State. The Republican party exhausted its administrative remedies under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-176 because its letter to the Secretary of the State constituted a request for a declaratory ruling on the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the General Statutes. Because the Republican Party's gubernatorial candidate received more votes on his party's line in the prior election than the Governor received on either the Democratic Party or the Working Families Party lines, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-249a directed the Secretary of the State to place the Republican Party at the top of the ballot in the current general election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Court held that &sect; 9-249a was an ambiguous statute, and that the legislative history, genealogy, and public policy all supported a construction requiring the party whose candidate for governor polled the highest number of votes on that party's line be given precedence on the ballot in the subsequent general election. The Republican Party candidate was to be placed at the top of the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a jury found defendant guilty of first-degree kidnapping (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A)) and first-degree sexual assault, the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Windham (Connecticut) granted defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping charge. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant grabbed a woman in her kitchen, held a tool to her neck, dragged her down a hallway, and moved her to a bedroom, where he raped her. The trial court granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping charge on the ground the State failed to prove he intended to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which was necessary to commit the sexual assault. The high court disagreed. The jury could have reasonably found that his confinement and movement of the victim exceeded that which was necessary to sexually assault her, increased the risk of harm to her, and were intended to impede her ability to escape or  summon help. The terms &quot;restrain&quot; and &quot;abduct&quot; in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-91(1) and (2) were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct, as he had fair warning in 1988, when he committed the crimes, that his movement of the victim while he was sexually assaulting her could constitute the basis for an independent kidnapping conviction. The trial court's kidnapping instructions were not misleading but properly informed the jury of the elements of the offense and the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The high court reversed the judgment of the trial court only as to the kidnapping charge and remanded the case to that court with direction to render judgment in accordance with the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant hospital appealed a judgment entered by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain, Connecticut, for plaintiff surgeon on his breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference with business expectancies claims, which awarded the surgeon punitive damages and offer of judgment interest on remand. The appeal was transferred by the state's highest court to itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state's highest court held that because the hospital was the appellee in a previous appeal, any deficiency with regard to raising claims on appeal did not result in forfeiture. The hospital's immunity claim under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11101 et seq., had never been considered by the state's highest court on the merits, and the court had not expended considerable judicial resources in ascertaining whether it could review the claim. The surgeon's claim that the hospital's immunity claim was beyond the scope of the remand was rejected. The hospital had remedied the procedural defect that the state's highest court had identified previously. A summary suspension followed by notice and a hearing under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11112(c)(2) was entitled to a presumption of immunity when necessary to prevent imminent danger to patients. Section &sect; 11112(c) was an exception to literal compliance with &sect; 11112(a)(3), rather than a freestanding ground for immunity, and therefore was covered by the presumption of immunity that applied to &sect; 11112(a). The surgeon did not advance any substantive argument in opposition to the hospital's immunity claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with direction to render judgment in favor of the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury found defendant guilty of capital felony in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54b(7), two counts of murder in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a, and assault in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59(a)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant contended that the trial court improperly precluded him from presenting expert testimony on the fallibility of eyewitness testimony and that case law concluding that the average juror knows about the factors affecting the reliability of eyewitness identification should be overruled. The supreme court agreed it was time to overrule State v. Kemp, 199 Conn. 473, 477, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986), and State v. McClendon, 248 Conn. 572, 586, 730 A.2d 1107 (1999). The supreme court held that reliability of eyewitness identification was frequently not a matter within the knowledge of an average juror and that admission of expert testimony on the issue did not invade the province of the jury to determine what weight to give the evidence. Many of the factors affecting reliability of eyewitness identification were either unknown to the average juror or contrary to common assumptions. While the trial court erred in excluding defendant's expert on the issue, the error was harmless, as the jury instructions provided assistance to the jury and, in combination with the evidence of defendant's guilt, ensured that the exclusion of the expert's testimony did not substantially affect the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The State asserted that the trial court's instructions, when considered in their entirety did not deny defendant his right to a fair trial. The supreme court agreed with the State, concluding that the improper instructions neither affected the fairness of the trial, nor prejudiced defendant. Among other things, the trial court explicitly instructed the jury panel that the jury's role was that of fact finder and prefaced and concluded each instruction to the venire panel by stating that sentencing was not the function of the jury. In addition, the jury was instructed on the presumption of innocence, the State's burden of proof, the elements of the crimes, and the fact that time was not an element of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff property owner appealed a decision by the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Britain (Connecticut) which found in favor of defendant department of environmental protection ordering him to remove a new seawall that he had constructed. The trial court concluded, inter alia, that the department had produced substantial evidence supporting its jurisdiction and that Conn. Gen. Sat. &sect; 22a-359 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The department had exercised its statutory jurisdiction to regulate activity in the tidal, coastal, or navigable waters of the state waterward of the high tide line because the property owner constructed the contested seawall without obtaining the permit required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-361(a)(1). The appellate court held that substantial evidence showed the seawall was constructed waterward of the high tide line. Numerous photographs showing direct evidence of water coming into contact with the seawall and the multitude of surveys of the property consistently showing at least part of the seawall waterward of even the 5.7 foot elevation claimed by the property owner to be the high tide line provided more than sufficient nontechnical evidence to determine that the seawall lay waterward of the high tide line. Thus, it fell within the department's jurisdiction. The property owner could not prevail on his claim that the definition of &quot;high tide line&quot; contained in &sect; 22a-359(c) was unconstitutionally vague. However, the department abused its discretion in issuing an order requiring the property owner to submit a plan for the removal of the entire seawall.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The part the judgment denying the appeal from the department's removal order was reversed, insofar as that order pertained to the portion of the seawall not waterward of the high tide line. The trial court was directed to remand the case to the department for further proceedings to determine which portions of the seawall were constructed &quot;waterward of the high tide line&quot; and thus were subject to the department's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner Commission of Children and Families was granted temporary custody of respondent father's children. The father appealed the ruling that the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-175, applied to the placement of the children, even though he was their noncustodial parent. He challenged an order of the Appellate Court (Connecticut), which dismissed his appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court found that the father's appeal was moot because he was awarded physical custody of the children. The supreme court held that the appellate court improperly dismissed the appeal. The father's fell within the &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception to the mootness doctrine. His claim that when the placement of a child with a parent was approved pursuant to the recommendation of a compact study application of &sect; 17a-175 to the parent violated substantive due process principles met the evading review requirement because it would become moot in the substantial majority of cases in which it could be raised, and resolution of the statutory interpretation claim was a necessary prerequisite to the resolution of the constitutional claim. The trial court improperly ruled that &sect; 17a-175 applied to out-of-state, noncustodial parents. The ordinary meaning of the phrase &quot;for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption&quot; as used in &sect; 17a-175, article III(a), did not encompass placement with a noncustodial parent. Children in the care of their own parents were not in &quot;foster care,&quot; and parents were not required to adopt their own children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded the case to that court with direction to sustain the father's appeal and to remand the case to the trial court with direction to reverse the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly compelled him to wear identifiable prison clothing during his jury trial in violation of his constitutional right to a fair trial pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court impermissibly compelled defendant, who had objected to wearing prison clothing during trial, to stand trial in such clothing, that the doctrine of harmless error did not apply, and that, even if it did apply, the State failed to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court held that although the Appellate Court properly reversed defendant's conviction, in the exercise of its supervisory authority over the administration of justice, the Supreme Court was announcing a per se rule of reversibility when, as in the present case, the trial court compelled a defendant to stand trial before a jury in identifiable prison clothing in violation of his constitutional rights as that undermined the integrity of the trial and diminished the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole by compromising the jury's ability to engage in neutral fact-finding and eroding the presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court improperly failed, under U.S. Const. amend. VIII, to disclose certain documents from social service's file that potentially would have given the jury a broader and more comprehensive picture of defendant's family history to consider as a mitigating factor at sentencing. The supreme court agreed. The trial court improperly failed to disclose numerous entries and records that, if made available to the defendant, his counsel and supporting experts, during their mitigation investigation, could well have shed additional light on the significant dysfunction and violence that systemically plagued defendant's entire family. There were multiple sexual molestations of one child. The supreme court could not find that, had those facts, and others in the nondisclosed department records, been properly presented to the jury as part of a comprehensive family history, they would not have swayed the case in mitigation by painting an even more harrowing picture of defendant's family life, especially in light of the failure of anyone from defendant's immediate family to testify on his behalf at the penalty hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed his weapon-related convictions by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut). He claimed the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search incident to his arrest as the police seized him prior to his arrest without reasonable and articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity as required by U.S. Const. amend.

They observed defendant on a bicycle make a gesture consistent with adjusting an unholstered handgun tucked into his pants' waistband. Defendant yelled an obscenity when he saw the officers and attempted to quickly ride away. The officers ordered defendant to stop. He ignored the command and continued to pedal away. The officers then apprehended defendant, and, in the course of the ensuing struggle, they discovered a loaded handgun. The appellate court held that defendant was not seized until the officers ordered him to stop. By simply stepping into the road, the police officers did not exercise physical force or make a show of authority such that a reasonable person would feel restrained from departing. Defendant's acts collectively could, at the very least, be reasonably construed as &quot;nervous, evasive behavior,&quot; which was a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion. That, coupled with his attempted flight and appearance, provided a basis for adequate reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, an attorney, had been sued in connection with her thefts from an elderly client. The State charged her with perjury based on allegedly false statements she made during a deposition taken in connection with that suit.

The intermediate appellate court held that defendant waived her right to challenge the instruction that the trial court gave by failing to object, and by agreeing that materiality was a question of law that should not be submitted to the jury. The high court held that as defendant submitted a request to charge pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super.

The attorney appointed for the conservatee did not object to the conservatorship or inform the probate court that it lacked jurisdiction over the application under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-648(a) (Rev. 2005). The conservatee alleged that he was placed in a locked ward for no reason and that he was threatened and assaulted by his roommate. Following the conservatee's death, his executrix was substituted as plaintiff. Absolute quasi-judicial immunity extended to the conservator only when the conservator was executing an order of the probate court. When the conservator acted as a fiduciary of the conservatee, the conservator was subject to personal liability. Furthermore, absolute quasi-judicial immunity did not extend to an attorney appointed pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-649(b) (Rev. 2005).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, a Missouri bookseller, appealed assessments of sales and use tax deficiencies against it by defendant, the Connecticut Commissioner of Revenue Services, under Connecticut's Sales and Use Taxes Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-406 et seq. The Superior Court, Judicial District of New Britain, Tax Session (Connecticut), sustained plaintiff's appeals. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff distributed its books by mail to Connecticut classrooms. It had no employees, offices, or property in Connecticut; teachers ordered its products on behalf of their students through catalogs. The trial court held that the taxes could not be imposed as the teachers were not plaintiff's &quot;representatives&quot; as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-407(a)(15)(A)(iv). The high court disagreed. &quot;Representative&quot; was a person who was not an employee or an agent and who did not necessarily act through delegated authority for remuneration. As plaintiff was able to sell its products in Connecticut only through the teachers who participated in its program, they were its &quot;representatives&quot; even though they were unpaid and had no agency relationship with plaintiff. Thus, pursuant to &sect; 12-407(a)(15)(A), it was subject to Connecticut sales and use taxes. As teachers participating in the program were the only means through which plaintiff communicated with Connecticut schoolchildren, they provided the substantial nexus required to permit imposition of sales and use taxes under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court's bright-line physical presence rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgments were reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with direction to deny plaintiff's appeals and to render judgments for defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an action involving defendant state board of education's decision to authorize defendant commissioner of education to reconstitute defendant local board of education, the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury, Complex Litigation Docket (Connecticut), certified five questions of law. The dispositive question was whether the state board violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233e(h) when it authorized the local board's reconstitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">For at least seven consecutive years, the state board had designated the local school district a low achieving district under &sect; 10-233e(c)(1). The local district had failed to make acceptable progress toward state benchmarks, under &sect; 10-233e(a) and (c), and had failed to make adequate yearly progress under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6301 et seq. for at least two consecutive years. In three cases, plaintiffs, city residents and former members of the local board, sought declaratory and injunctive relief after the state board authorized the reconstitution of the local board. Because the state board failed to require the local board to undergo and complete training, as required by the mandatory provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233e(h), it violated the statute when it authorized the commissioner to reconstitute the local board. The training provision was not protective of any particular individual or group, and neither the statute nor its legislative history provided that local boards of education were entitled to make their own determination as to whether training or reconstitution was appropriate. The training provision cannot be waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, a town and a zoning enforcement officer, sought a temporary injunction to prevent defendant owners from refusing to permit a property inspection for zoning violations. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut) granted an injunction. The trial court granted the owners' motion for a stay of execution. Two of the owners appealed, three of the owners brought writs of error, and the cases were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The zoning officer had attempted to inspect the owners' property pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-12, but the owners refused to consent to the inspection. The trial court held that the town's interest in stabilizing property values and promoting the general welfare justified the inspection. However, a zoning inspection pursuant to &sect; 8-12 of areas in which the owners had a reasonable expectation of privacy was a search within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Probable cause was necessary to justify any &sect; 8-12 search for zoning violations that targeted a single residence. Accordingly, the zoning official was only entitled to inspect a single property, not part of a routine or area wide search, under &sect; 8-12 if the official first obtained an injunction issued upon probable cause by a judicial officer. Because the trial court failed to make a preliminary determination of probable cause to believe that a zoning violation existed on the property, the trial court's order violated the owners' right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Named plaintiff citizen sought and received a waiver of the entry fee and the process server's service fees pursuant to Conn.

In connection with serving process, the marshal received a box from the citizen with a sufficient quantity of copies to serve all 185 defendants and, subsequently, properly effectuated service by leaving process for each defendant with an associate attorney general. The marshal did not personally make the copies of the complaint, but confirmed that each was exactly the same as the original. Thereafter, the marshal submitted an invoice for $ 900 for copies of the complaint. The appellate court held that the trial court improperly denied her request for fees for copies; although &sect; 52-261(a)(2) was ambiguous as to whether the process server must personally make the copies of the complaint, the legislative history revealed an intent that the fee for copies be paid regardless of who actually made the copies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the retroactive application of the Connecticut Supreme Court's prior decision violated ex post facto principles. The court's excision in Bell of the language from &sect; 53a-40(h) that had required the court, rather than a jury, to make the requisite public interest finding resulted in an ameliorative change to &sect; 53a-40(h) that was merely procedural and did not make the punishment under &sect; 53a-40(h) more onerous than it was before Bell was decided. Therefore, defendant was not disadvantaged retroactively by the statutory modification. Furthermore, defendant was on fair notice that the substantive provisions of &sect; 53a-40(h) would apply to him even if certain procedural provisions were later found to be unconstitutional. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to introduce evidence of the costs of his incarceration to demonstrate that his extended incarceration would not best serve the public interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court revoked defendant's probation pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-32 on the basis of its finding that he had committed the crime of risk of injury to a child (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1)). Defendant appealed; the Connecticut Appellate Court affirmed. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Motorists saw a small child in the street and called police. Defendant, the sole caretaker present in the home, told an officer that he had left his two-year-old child unsupervised in a room with an eight-year-old child, and the younger child apparently exited the home through a back door. Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 53-21(a)(1), which in turn led to the revocation of his probation. The intermediate appellate court, in affirming that revocation, held that the evidence was sufficient to show that he failed to supervise his child adequately, despite his knowledge that the back door of his home was unsecured. The high court disagreed. Without any evidence of the back door's accessibility, and in light of testimony establishing that the child had never escaped the house in this manner before, it was not reasonably foreseeable that the child would exit the home. Therefore, the predicate facts proved by the State were insufficient to establish that defendant's failure to supervise the child while at home evinced a reckless disregard for the consequences of that conduct in violation of &sect; 53-21(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed and the case was remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Church and Diocese had sought a judgment declaring that the real and personal property of the church was held in trust them following a decision by the majority of voting members of the church to affiliate with an ecclesiastical society that was not part of the Episcopal Church or the Diocese. The Connecticut Supreme Court held that the trial court properly determined that church property was held in trust for the Church and the Diocese and in ordering a former rector of the church and 12 present or former officers or vestry members of the church, to relinquish possession of control of the property to the Church and Diocese. The trial court rejected the original request for an order of accounting pursuant to the accounting statutes. When the trial court granted the second request, it explained that it was granting the order on the basis of its equitable authority and discretion to protect the integrity of its prior declaration. The Supreme Court was unable to afford the individual members any practical relief by reversing the trial court's order requiring full compliance with the order of accounting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial on one charge of kidnapping, because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it could not find him guilty of the crime unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the restraint or force involved was not merely incidental to the underlying assault. The supreme court agreed that such an instruction should have been given and concluded that it was not harmless. Defendant was entitled to have the jury decide whether his restraint of the victim during the assault had independent criminal significance as a kidnapping, as there was testimony that another person took the victim out to the car while defendant remained in the house. Defendant's challenge to the instruction on risk of injury to a child failed, as there was no possibility the jury was led to believe it could find defendant guilty upon proof his conduct in causing the child to be left alone for 25 minutes was merely inadvertent. Finally, the supreme court concluded that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague, but apprised a personal on ordinary intelligence that it was dangerous and unsafe to leave an infant alone for a period of time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court's judgment was reversed as to one count of kidnapping and remanded for a new trial on the charge. The judgment of the trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (commission) sued defendants landlords in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield, Housing Session at Bridgeport (Connecticut), on behalf of relators tenants for housing discrimination in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-64c(a). The trial court entered judgment for the commission, assessed a fine, and awarded damages to the tenants. The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The landlords said the trial court lacked jurisdiction when it did not issue a decision within the 120 days required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-183b. The supreme court disagreed because, after the landlords filed a damages brief, the trial court properly reopened the case within 120 days and then rendered judgment within 120 days of that reopening. It was no error to conclude that a security deposit guarantee was a &quot;lawful source of income,&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46a-64c and 46a-63(3), for purposes of unlawful discrimination based on a &quot;lawful source of income,&quot; because it was &quot;housing assistance&quot; included in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-63(3)'s definition of a lawful source of income. It was no error to conclude that the guarantee's validity was irrelevant because the landlords did not reject it due to any invalidity but for the illegal reason that it was not cash. Compensatory damages were not excessive because, (1) while no findings on damages were made, the landlords did not move for articulation, and (2) a tenant's testimony provided an adequate basis for emotional distress damages for the tenant and the tenant's children, so the award did not shock the judicial conscience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was placed on probation after he pled guilty to possession of child pornography.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's computer had nude photos of his ex-girlfriend which had been accessed while he was on probation. The trial court found he violated a special condition of probation that he not possess sexually stimulating material deemed inappropriate by a probation officer. The high court rejected his claims that the condition was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face and thus impinged on his constitutional right to privacy; the overbreadth doctrine applied only to claims of a violation of U.S. Const. amend. I. The condition was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-193(14)--which he was presumed to know--banned the possession of images of the &quot;lascivious exhibition of the genitals&quot; that appeared in the photos of his ex-girlfriend, which would reasonably have been deemed sexually explicit under any definition of pornography. His conduct fell so clearly within the core meaning of the special condition that there could be no substantial concern as to its arbitrary enforcement. Evidence that, inter alia, he did not try to delete the photos and that they had been accessed during his probation was sufficient to support revocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant claimed that the appellate court improperly concluded that the warrantless search of his house did not violate his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment. He contended that the police intrusion into his house was not warranted under the emergency doctrine because a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would not have believed that a warrantless entry was necessary to assist a person in need of immediate aid, and that the exception was not satisfied when the officer stepped over the gate to the house into defendant's curtilage area. The supreme court agreed with defendant, first concluding that the warrantless search began when the officer stepped over the gate onto defendant's curtilage, an area in which defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy and which was protected by the Fourth Amendment. The supreme court further concluded that a reasonable officer in the officer's position would not have believed an emergency existed justifying the warrantless entry. The possibility a 16-year-old son was disobeying his father did not imply a danger to human life, destruction of evidence, or the flight of a suspect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with six counts of risk of injury to a child in three separate informations, which were consolidated for trial.

However, defendant learned that the prosecutor was in possession of and had read certain written materials seized from the computer that discussed defendant's trial strategy with respect to two of the cases. Defendant's motion to dismiss the informations based on the claim that the State intentionally invaded the attorney-client privilege, thereby violating his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI, was denied upon the trial court's determination that the intrusion was unintentional and that defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant was convicted of one charge after a jury trial. On appeal, the court found that dismissal was warranted. Defendant was presumptively prejudiced by the prosecutor's intrusion into his privileged communications, whether the intrusion was intentional or not, and the taint was irreversible.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 52-190a(a). The administrators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an attempt to comply with &sect; 52-190a(a), which required a medical malpractice plaintiff to attach to the complaint a written opinion of a similar health care provider attesting to a good faith basis for the action, the administrators attached to their original complaint an opinion letter from a physician who was board certified in internal medicine with a subspecialty in cardiovascular disease. Over a year later, the administrators filed an amended complaint and also attached a written opinion letter from a vascular surgeon. The surgeons failed to move to dismiss the original complaint until more than 19 months after the administrators had commenced the action. The good faith certificate and written opinion letter required by &sect; 52-190a were requirements of process, which the surgeons waived pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-32, by failing to file a motion to dismiss within the thirty day time period provided in Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-30. By failing to timely file a motion to dismiss, the surgeons thus waived their right to challenge the sufficiency of the original complaint and the original written opinion letter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants argued that plaintiff's lawsuit was barred under the ministerial exception to the court's subject matter jurisdiction over employment disputes between religious institutions and their leaders. The high court held that the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss on the ground of a colorable claim to immunity under the ministerial exception was an appealable final judgment. Plaintiff's duties as a principal of a religious school rendered her a ministerial employee. Her claims of promissory estoppel, breach of implied contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing were barred by the ministerial exception as they essentially asked the trial court to police the archdiocese's compliance with its own internal procedures. Her claims of wrongful termination, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and tortious interference with business expectancies were also barred by the ministerial exception because they arose from defendants' decision to fire plaintiff, and requiring the trial court to determine whether any proffered religious reasons were a pretext for unlawful action would amount to judging the archdiocese's employment decisions.</SPAN></P>

After hearing argument on the motion to withdraw the pleas, the trial court denied the motion on its merits and, thereafter, resentenced defendant for a second time. However, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because the motion was beyond the scope of the appellate court's remand for resentencing. Because the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court solely for resentencing, the trial court's authority was limited to that task and, accordingly, the trial court should have dismissed defendant's motion to withdraw the pleas rather than denied it on its merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain, Tax Session (Connecticut), granted defendant Commissioner of Revenue Services motion to dismiss plaintiff rail carrier's appeal of the Commission's decision denying the carrier's request for a refund of money paid to a distributor to cover the cost of a petroleum fuel products gross earning tax imposed on the distributor under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The carrier bought fuel from the distributor, who separately billed the carrier for the tax it paid pursuant to &sect; 12-587(b)(1). Although the carrier paid that amount directly to the distributor, it submitted a refund request, claiming that the tax was discriminatory because interstate water carriers were exempt from the tax, while rail carriers were not. The commission denied the refund request on the ground that the carrier was not the taxpayer. The lower court correctly held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the carrier's action because it failed to establish statutory authority to bring the appeal. Although the lower court incorrectly concluded that the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (the 4-R Act), 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11501 et seq., applied only to ad valorem taxes of property, the carrier's request for relief exceeded that permitted under the 4-R Act because the 4-R Act did not provide for refunds of taxes already paid. Further, the carrier was not entitled to seek a refund from the State under Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-33 or -597 because only Conn. Gen. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant had been found not guilty of second-degree assault by reason of mental disease or defect and his mental health was assessed, the trial court had ordered his commitment for five years. On four occasions, the State had successfully petitioned to continue his commitment. The trial court had granted defendant's motion to dismiss the State's fifth petition, concluding that &sect; 17a-593(c) was unconstitutional. The high court had reversed, finding, inter alia, that defendant's equal protection rights had not been violated. On remand, the trial court granted the State's petition. This appeal followed. The high court held that the doctrine of res judicata precluded defendant's facial challenge in the present case because the claim in the instant appeal was the same claim he had raised in the first: that an acquittee's commitment under the board's jurisdiction, rather than under the system for civil commitment, violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. And because he did not distinguish his as applied challenge from his facial challenge, the decision in the prior appeal also disposed of his as applied challenge to &sect; 17a-593(c).</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the impropriety of the omission of the Salamon instruction was not harmless because a properly instructed jury reasonably could have concluded that the restraint of the victim was incidental to the commission of the robbery. The jury reasonably could have found that the victim was neither bound nor physically moved during the commission of the robbery, that she was restrained on her bed for no more than five minutes while defendant and his accomplices searched the room for valuables, and that the victim was released immediately after the robbery was complete. Finally, the court could not preclude the reasonable possibility that a jury could have found that the degree of force or intimidation imposed on the victim was not greater than that necessary to commit the underlying robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff ratepayer brought suit seeking to enjoin defendant department from enforcing a financing order issued by it directing certain public utility companies to retain the competitive transition assessment that it charged customers and to transfer the proceeds from such increase to the state's general fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At issue was whether the ratepayer's claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The ratepayer alleged that the department exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the financing order, because the charges were, in effect, an unauthorized tax. However, the appellate court found that the ratepayer failed to establish an equal protection claim under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, and, accordingly, that the constitutional sovereign immunity exception did not apply. The ratepayer argued simply that: (1) the charges arbitrarily applied to the distributor's customers but not to municipal payers, and (2) the order inequitably distributed the burden between the power company and the customers. Those allegations were insufficient. Further, the legislature had a rational basis for structuring the bond program as it did, namely, to distribute broadly the burden of deficit reduction while ensuring that no payers would be forced to pay more each month than the fee they had already been paying. The antecedent question of whether to tie deficit reduction to the taxpayer's electricity purchases was a policy issue that rested with the legislature and lay beyond the purview of the court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 29-38(a). Appellant was arraigned on the youthful offender docket. The Superior Court (Connecticut) found probable cause for his arrest, and then granted the State's motion to transfer the case from the youthful offender docket to the regular criminal docket, pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in granting the motion to transfer because he had a liberty interest in his status as a defendant on the youthful offender docket, and due process thus entitled him to a hearing before transfer. The appellate court agreed that appellant had a liberty interest in his status as a defendant on the youthful offender docket, but the failure to hold a hearing before the transfer did not deprive him of his right to due process. Appellant's due process right was satisfied by the requirement in &sect; 54-76c(b) of a hearing before the court on the regular criminal docket before the finalization of the transfer. Section 54-76c(b)(1) did not require notice and a hearing before a case may be transferred from the youthful offender docket to the regular criminal docket, but implicitly required a hearing on the regular criminal docket before finalization of a transfer from the youthful offender docket. Although appellant was not provided with a hearing on the youthful offender docket, the transfer had not yet been finalized.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After enacting state-funded programs giving class members medical benefits, the legislature effectively eliminated them. The supreme court held Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17b-192 did not violate equal protection, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, when applying strict scrutiny, because the members were not, due to alienage, denied benefits given to citizens, as (1) the eliminated programs only benefited aliens, so eliminating them did not discriminate between aliens and citizens, (2) citizens' eligibility for benefits under the state-federal Medicaid program did not make elimination of the state programs violate equal protection since the state did not control Medicaid eligibility, and (3) discriminating among different alien groups due to some aliens' continued eligibility was not due to suspect factors. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17b-257b, altering eligibility guidelines for a state medical assistance program such that the members were ineligible, did not violate equal protection because it created no classification based on alienage, as the guidelines applied equally to aliens and citizens by making those categorically eligible for Medicaid ineligible for the program.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court, assuming without deciding that firefighters were similarly situated to other municipal employees, held the statute discriminated against firefighters in favor of other municipal employees by barring firefighters eligible for workers' compensation from suing other firefighters for negligence arising from motor vehicle accidents in the scope of employment because other municipal employees could bring such suits against coworkers, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-465(a). The classification survived equal protection rational basis scrutiny because reducing municipal liability and fostering the provision of effective firefighting services were legitimate governmental objectives, and the legislature reasonably could conclude that litigation between firefighters arising from motor vehicle accidents was a greater risk to municipal liability than such litigation between other municipal employees, as (1) firefighters were more likely to operate large vehicles under emergency conditions, and (2) a threat of such litigation might deter volunteers from acting as firefighters.</SPAN></P>

Defendant went to someone else's room to hang out and, after making a joke at the room occupant's expense, was asked to leave by the occupant. Thereafter a fight ensued and defendant stabbed the victim four times. The issue before the supreme court was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-206(b)(3)(D) and (E) provided an implicit exception for the carrying of a weapon in an individual's residence or place of abode for any weapon other than a knife, the edged portion of the blade of which was four inches or more in length. Defendant contended that the exception was not limited to long knives. The State contended that, to the contrary, because &sect; 53-206(b)(3) expressly referred to &quot;the carrying of a knife, the edged portion of the blade of which is four inches or over in length,&quot; the exception plainly and unambiguously applied only to that weapon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, the Department of Health, appealed from the judgment from the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut) that declared plaintiff, a nongenetic, intended parent, as a legal parent of children born through a gestational carrier and ordered the Department to issue a replacement birth certificate, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-48a, naming the intended parent as the legal parent of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The intended parent and his partner, who was the children's biological father, entered into a gestational agreement with the carrier. Prior to the delivery date, the intended parent filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination he was a legal parent of the children and an order directing the Department to issue a replacement birth certificate. The Department argued &sect; 7-48a did not confer parental status on a nongenetic, intended parent. The state supreme court assumed, without deciding, the gestational agreement was valid. After analyzing the text and legislative history of &sect; 7-48a, the court concluded the legislature intended &sect; 7-48a to confer parental status on an intended parent who was a party to a valid gestational agreement irrespective of that intended parent's genetic relationship to the children. Such intended parents did not have to adopt the children in order to become legal parents. They acquired that status by operation of law, upon an order by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to &sect; 7-48a. Thus, the trial court properly ordered the Department to issue a replacement birth certificate listing the intended parent as a legal parent of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After petitioner inmate's kidnapping conviction under a prior interpretation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A) was affirmed, he sought habeas corpus relief, due to a later interpretation of the statute. The trial court reserved two questions of law for the advice of the Appellate Court (Connecticut) concerning the application of two Connecticut Supreme Court decisions, and the reservation was transferred to the Connecticut Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the inmate's conviction, the statute was reinterpreted to require proof of an intent to restrain a victim beyond that required to commit an underlying crime. The supreme court held the reinterpretation applied retroactively as a matter of state retroactivity common law because (1) the reinterpretation substantively determined the elements of kidnapping, and (2) the inmate was convicted of a crime he arguably did not commit. A per se retroactivity rule was not proper because cases existed in which denying retroactive relief might not be arbitrary or unjust. The State's reliance on the prior interpretation did not make retroactive relief improper because nothing showed the State would have charged the inmate differently under the reinterpretation. A claim that retroactivity would flood the court system with habeas petitions did not make it improper because nothing showed it would impose an unmanageable burden. It was not proper to deny relief when the passage of time barred retrying some cases because inmates would still serve sentences for underlying crimes. The reinterpretation applied retroactively to the inmate because the rationales favoring full retroactivity applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff workers' compensation carrier filed a declaratory judgment suit seeking a ruling that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-294c(d) was unconstitutional. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) denied the motion to dismiss filed by intervening defendant law firm for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and granted the carrier's motion for summary judgment, concluding that &sect; 31-294c(d) violated Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The firm appealed. The state's highest court held that &sect; 31-294c(a) was subject matter jurisdictional. The claimant's failure to file a notice of claim within the time limit, and the failure of the notice of claim to fall under a &sect; 31-294c exception deprived the commissioner of subject matter jurisdiction. Section 31-294c(d) merely created an additional exception to the limitations period. The carrier's legal interest in the declaratory judgment action was in being protected from defending against a stale claim. That interest was injured by &sect; 31-294c(d). The carrier had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action. The carrier was not required to proceed to the merits before filing the declaratory judgment suit. The only way to determine whether the carrier could obtain the relief it sought was to resolve the constitutional challenge, which the commissioner could not do. That &sect; 31-294c(a) simultaneously protected the carrier from defending against the stale claim and was a prerequisite for the commissioner's jurisdiction rendered further proceedings before the commissioner futile. The holding that &sect; 31-294c(d) was unconstitutional was not challenged.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, which had concerns about the mother's mental health, found that plaintiff met his burden of proof under Roth v. Weston to obtain visitation, but that visitation would not be in the child's best interest because the mother would react by inflicting greater psychological harm on the child than that which would result from the denial of visitation. The high court held that the best interest of the child standard could not overcome the Roth standard for ordering visitation. The trial court, in effect, sanctioned the mother's inflicting harm akin to abuse or neglect and allowed her to prevail in a case in which she had lost on the merits.

The high court disagreed. Under Conn. Gen.

However, the Board incorrectly concluded that under &sect; 7-433c a claimant had to file a notice of claim within one year from the date that he knew or should have known that he had symptoms of hypertension. Evidence that plaintiff knew of past elevated blood pressure readings was not sufficient to trigger &sect; 31-294c(a)'s one-year limitations period limitation period in absence of evidence he had been diagnosed with hypertension by a medical professional and had been informed of that diagnosis.</SPAN></P>

Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 23-29(2), as he simply repeated the ineffective assistance allegations of his first petition, but those claims were unrelated to the relief he sought since (1) neither his trial or appellate counsel represented him regarding his withdrawn appeal, (2) he did not allege ineffective assistance of counsel who represented him when his appeal was withdrawn, and (3) he did not allege that withdrawal resulted from any constitutional impairment, so his failure to exhaust his state court remedies did not result from any unconstitutional impairment of his right to appeal but from his own decision to withdraw the appeal from the denial of his first petition.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found no error. Among other things, the trial court found that defendant was not in custody because he came to the police department on his own accord and made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights. The supreme court further noted that even if defendant were in custody, his statement was admissible because he had voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. The trial court rejected defendant's testimony that he never saw or signed the Miranda rights car, the voluntary statement form, or his statement that he had been assaulted by an officer.

The secretary of the convention delivered the certificate to a post office clerk and paid the proper postage to send it by first class mail to defendant's office. Though the envelope bore the correct address and return address, it was not received by defendant's office nor was it returned to the sender. Learning that defendant had not received the certificate, plaintiff delivered a substitute original certificate to her office after the deadline expired. The high court held that compliance with &sect; 9-388's deadline for delivering the certificate was mandatory and was established by actual receipt of the certificate. Defendant had no discretion to give legal effect to the substitute certificate since it was not timely delivered. Because the legislature required strict compliance with the deadline of &sect; 9-388, the trial court could not invoke its equitable authority to compel defendant to act in direct contravention to this clear legislative mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the United States Constitution and the Connecticut Constitution required law enforcement agents to record electronically, whenever feasible, custodial interrogations, Miranda warnings  and any resulting statements made by a defendant; and that the State violated his right to remain silent by introducing testimony regarding his refusal to sign a Miranda rights acknowledgment card, refusal to provide a written statement, termination of an interview, and assertion of his right to remain silent. The supreme court found no errors. The supreme court held that because the text of the provisions on which defendant relied made no reference to a corroboration requirement for the admissibility of confessions and because, according to Connecticut case law, those provisions did not provide broader protections than their federal counterparts, those factors did not support defendant's claim that a recording requirement was mandated by Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 9. Defendant's right to remain silent was not violated, as his refusal to sign the Miranda rights card was not an invocation of his right to remain silent, and most significantly, defendant did not remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The State also argued that the appellate court improperly concluded that, under the federal constitution, the scope or length of the traffic stop must be limited to its initial purpose. The supreme court agreed, concluding that the officer's questions, including his request for consent to search, were permissible, as they did not measurably extend the duration of the traffic stop. In addition, despite the officer's failure to inform defendant that he had the right to refuse to consent to the search, the supreme court found defendant's consent to be voluntary. The scope of defendant's consent was not limited to an invitation to check for beer on the floor by the passenger seat, but extended to the passenger compartment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant responded that the State lacked the reasonable and articulable suspicion required by Terry for stopping him and that the appellate court properly determined, in essence, that the mere fact that defendant had a cross hanging from the rearview mirror of the car that he was driving did not give rise to a reasonable and articulable suspicion by the officer stopping the car that he was violating &sect; 14-99f (c). The supreme court concluded that the record reflected that the State failed to establish the requisite evidentiary record in support of that standard. There was no testimony by the officer that he had in fact relief upon objectively certifiable qualities of the items hanging from rear view mirror that made them distracting or that interfered with the driver's view.

Defendant also claimed that the resentencing order was improper because he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to a jury trial on the issue of whether an extended period of incarceration would best serve the public interest. The supreme court concluded the defendant's original nolo contendere plea on the persistent felony offender charge necessarily and validly waived his right to a jury trial as to his guilt and the public interest determination. The trial court provided defendant with ample disclosure of the risks and identified the right to a jury trial as a right he was surrendering.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield (Connecticut) judgment convicting him of unlawfully transporting cocaine and heroin with intent to sell by a person not drug dependent, unlawfully transporting cocaine and heroin with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of a public housing project (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278a(b)), cocaine possession, and failure to appear in the first degree (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-172(a)(1)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was arrested while in possession of a vehicle that did not belong to him. He claimed that he did not know anything about drugs that were found secreted in the vehicle and proffered evidence that a convicted drug dealer, who previously had left drugs and money in the vehicle, had driven the vehicle shortly before him. The supreme court found that this evidence was highly relevant to defendant's theory of defense and that the trial court's exclusion of the third party culpability evidence violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to present a defense with respect to the drug charges. The policies underlying Conn. Code Evid. R. 4-4(a) and 4-5(a) had extremely limited applicability when a defendant offered evidence of a character trait or other crimes, wrongs, or acts to prove that someone else committed the crime charged. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of failure to appear in the first degree, as the jury reasonably could have inferred that his appearance in court on January 6, 2003, was a term or condition of his bond in view of the fact that his bond was forfeited and that he was ordered rearrested after his failure to appear on that day.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The convictions on the drug charges were reversed and defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the charge of unlawfully transporting cocaine and heroin with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of a public housing project and a new trial on the remaining drug charges. The trial court's judgment with respect to defendant's conviction of failure to appear in the first degree was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff insureds filed suit seeking a judgment declaring that defendant insurers were obligated to provide them underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The policy, consistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336(g)(1), permitted a claim for UIM benefits to be brought as long as written notice of intent to bring such a claim was filed within three years of the accident. Over three years after the accident, plaintiffs provided defendants written notice of their intent to seek UIM benefits; their claim was denied as untimely. They argued that their failure to meet the time limit had to be excused unless defendants showed they were prejudiced by the late notice. To the extent Hotkowski v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., 617 A.2d 451 (1992), left open the question whether prejudice had to be considered in determining if an insured could be excused from complying with a time limit for bringing UIM claims, the high court rejected the proposition. An unambiguous contract provision limiting the time in which an insurance claim had to be filed was enforceable. As plaintiffs failed to present any evidence as to what defendants did to mislead them, no issue of fact precluded the trial court from granting summary judgment to defendants. Section 38a-336(g)(1) did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to private insurers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, a candidate and his campaign, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut), which denied their request for a temporary injunction (TI) to prevent defendants, the State Elections Enforcement Commission (SEEC) and state officials, from taking certain actions as to defendants, a joint committee (JC) and other campaigns, under the Citizens' Election Program, Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed his convictions of first degree manslaughter and two counts each of sale and possession of narcotics. The Connecticut Appellate Court reversed his conviction of first degree manslaughter and remanded the case to the trial court, which modified the conviction to second degree manslaughter and resentenced defendant on all counts, increasing the prison terms it had previously imposed on the drug counts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The victim died from an overdose of drugs supplied by defendant. The intermediate appellate court held there was insufficient evidence to convict him of first degree manslaughter, but sufficient evidence to convict him of second degree manslaughter. Defendant's new aggregate sentence was two years shorter than the original one. Under the aggregate package theory, after one or more convictions were vacated, a trial court could increase sentences on the surviving counts if the total sentence was not exceeded. The high court held that as this theory applied regardless of the basis for remand, that the conviction was vacated due to insufficient evidence was immaterial. Nothing in the remand order implied the trial court was limited to reimposing a sentence only on the second degree manslaughter count. As the second sentence was less severe than the first, judicial vindictiveness was not presumed under North Carolina v. Pearce. And as defendant failed to establish the trial court acted with actual vindictiveness, his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated. Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 did not provide greater protection than the U.S. Constitution in this regard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After their arrests, the commissioner notified the drivers that their licenses would be suspended for 90 days because they had failed chemical alcohol tests. The drivers argued that the commissioner improperly used a weight of alcohol to volume of breath ratio to establish that they had an elevated blood alcohol content when &sect; 14-227b(o) required proof of a weight of alcohol to weight of blood ratio. According to the drivers, there was no evidence of any mathematical calculation or other conversion to transform the weight to volume Intoxilyzer results in their cases into weight to weight ratios. The trial court disagreed that the measurement produced by an Intoxilyzer did not comport with the requirement of &sect; 14-227b(o)(1). The state supreme court examined the record on appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, and was persuaded that the judgments of the trial court upholding the commissioner's suspension of the drivers' licenses should be affirmed. Because the trial court's memorandum of decision fully addressed the arguments raised on appeal, the trial court's well reasoned decision was adopted as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on the issues.</SPAN></P>

An unchartered association in fact enterprise did not require proof of an ascertainable structure separate from that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity with which defendant was charged. The racketeering convictions were supported. Defendant repeatedly conceded that she was involved in a criminal conspiracy with her accomplice to issue fraudulent licenses. The omission of an instruction on an enterprise was harmless error. CORA did not require proof that the enterprise existed beyond that inherent in the commission of the underlying crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state's highest court held that assuming a seizure occurred, the officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was involved in criminal activity based on a tip from a known confidential informant. The informant was reliable and his veracity had been demonstrated through previous contacts with the police, including one of the officers. The tip carried a greater indicia of reliability than one from an anonymous informant and required less verification. The police officers corroborated that defendant was driving a particular make and color of a car with Pennsylvania license plates in a certain area of town. It was reasonable for the officers to infer that the confidential informant's tip was reliable and that such a tip provided them with a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. When the police were familiar with the informant and his credibility has been established, and the police were able to corroborate several aspects of the tip by personal observation, the fact that the tip did not state the informant's basis of knowledge did not preclude the officers from having a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, a three judge panel convicted defendant of two counts of murder under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a(a), and one count each of capital felony under Conn. Gen. stat. &sect; 53a-54b(8) and (9). In accordance with the jury's findings during the penalty phase, the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Connecticut) sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the seizure by police exceeded the bounds of a Terry stop and he did not voluntarily consent to go to the police department for questioning. The supreme court found no error, concluding that the blocking of defendant's vehicle was the most efficacious way to maintain the status quo and get defendant's attention. In addition, defendant was not handcuffed or told he was could not leave. The evidence further showed that defendant voluntarily went the police department after the officers merely asked defendant if he would be willing to go. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the counts related to the death of the infant, who was in utero at the time of the crime but was delivered by cesarean section and died 6 weeks later. While the supreme court agreed with the trial court that the infant who was born alive and later died was a &quot;person&quot; under Connecticut homicide statues, the supreme court also agreed with defendant's contention that the trial court failed to apply the Guess principles to determine whether or not the infant was born alive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed with respect to both counts of capital felony and the count of murder relating to the child, and the case was remanded for a new trial as to those counts. The judgment was affirmed with respect to defendant's conviction for the murder of the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff State appealed a decision by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) that dissolved prejudgment attachments in the State's favor that had been filed against defendant owners' property; the State claimed that the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the applications for the attachments because they did not comply with Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the State filed an action against the owners for violation of Conn. Gen.

Thereafter, the trial court concluded that the State's affidavits in support of the application were invalid because the affiant was not a competent affiant. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the trial court's conclusion was premised on an incorrect interpretation of the term &quot;competent affiant.&quot; Although the affiant lacked personal knowledge to aver to the truth of the allegations underlying the complaints, he nonetheless was competent to represent the nature and extent of those complaints. The affiant derived personal knowledge of the existence, nature, and content of the State's prejudgment application by personally reviewing the complaints and the State's investigative file. Therefore, because he was a competent affiant, the trial court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Instead of taking her to school, defendant drove his 12-year-old niece to his home and raped her. He argued that as attendance records showed she was in school at the time of the crimes, and her testimony was inconsistent, the evidence was insufficient. The high court disagreed; the jury reasonably could have found that those records were the product of a data entry error and that the victim's testimony was credible. Thus, the new trial motion was properly denied. His right to compulsory process under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was not violated when the State failed to notify him that it had released from subpoena the lead investigator, who then became temporarily unavailable to testify, as 1) there was no evidence the State did so in bad faith or with knowledge that he would then be unable to testify, 2) his testimony would have been cumulative, and 3) defendant neither issued his own subpoenas nor sought a continuance. The prosecutor did not state her personal belief about the victim's veracity, and her two improper comments about the victim's courage did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, as the verdict would not have differed absent the impropriety.</SPAN></P>

The phrase &quot;attorney at law of at least 10 years' active practice&quot; meant an attorney with at least some experience litigating cases in court. As she had no experience representing persons in court, she was not eligible to hold the office of attorney general. Performance of her official duties did not constitute the active practice of law under &sect; 3-124. As the office of attorney general impliedly was exempt from Conn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee alleged that the State had received approximately 1.6 million shares of stock that should have been distributed to state employees pursuant to the insurers' plan of conversion. Because it concluded that the employee could prevail on his claim of an unconstitutional taking if he could establish at trial that the State had acted as his agent when it received the stock, the trial court denied the State's motion to dismiss the employee's taking claim. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that because the employee only alleged that the stock was not delivered to the State as the employees' agent in accordance with the plan of conversion, he failed to show that the State acted in excess of its statutory authority when it accepted the stock. The insurers lacked standing to bring their cross-appeal. Because nothing in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-259 set forth the manner in which the demutualization proceeds were to be distributed, the State was implicitly authorized to receive the benefits therefrom. Accordingly, the employee's claim of an unconstitutional taking and interpleader action should have been dismissed along with his constructive and resulting trust claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff alleged injured person appealed the grant of summary judgment by the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Connecticut) in favor of defendant car leasing company based on the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106 preempting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a. The injured person also claimed the Amendment was an unconstitutional under the commerce clause of the United States constitution, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The injured person's car was struck by defendant driver, whose company had leased the car. The car was not insured by the leasing company at the time of the accident. The injured person alleged, in part, that the leasing company, as owner and lessor of the car, was liable for the driver's negligent operation of the car under the theory of vicarious liability set forth in &sect; 14-154a. The appellate court held the savings provision of 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106(b)(1) excluded from preemption state laws that might require insurance or its equivalent as a condition of licensing or registration, or might impose such a requirement after an accident or unpaid judgment. Whereas the savings provision of &sect; 30106(b)(2) preserved state laws that suspended the license and registration of, or otherwise penalize, a car owner who fails to meet the requirement, or who failed to pay a judgment resulting from a collision. Because &sect; 14-154a(b)(1) did none of those things, it could not be deemed to be preserved. As the Graves Amendment preempted state law and was a valid exercise of Congressional authority under the commerce clause, the trial court properly granted the leasing company's summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed from the trial court's judgment of conviction, following a jury trial, of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress narcotics seized from the automobile he was driving incident to a routine traffic stop because the seizure of the narcotics violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's car was stopped in a neighborhood known for frequent drug trafficking activity after officers saw defendant, who was driving, was not wearing a seat belt. Two officers observed defendant make a movement toward his right side, which led them to believe that he might be concealing a weapon. An officer observed defendant close the center console in the front seat. While being frisked for weapons, $ 1369 in cash and several cell phones were discovered on his person. An officer observed some plastic protruding from the center console which was removed and determined to be cocaine. Under the collective knowledge doctrine, the appellate court held it could consider the knowledge of both officers in determining whether there was reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the protective search. The collective knowledge of the officers amply supported an inference that defendant was involved in narcotics trafficking, and, accordingly, that he was potentially armed and dangerous. Thus, there was a proper basis for effectuating the protective search of the console. The jury reasonably could have concluded he had possession of the narcotics sufficient to support the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

The State's motion in limine to admit certain prior misconduct evidence was granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court concluded, inter alia, that although defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his cell phone, the automobile exception applied under New York law. Because the police had probable cause to believe that defendant was selling drugs, because defendant's cell phone was visible in his car when police arrested him, and because the police had probable cause to believe that the cell phone contained evidence of drug activity, the police had probable cause to seize and search the contents of the phone under New York law, which applied to the search conducted in New York. While such a search would have been improper in Connecticut, there was no evidence Connecticut police were implicated in the seizure or the search of the phone. The supreme court next concluded the any error in the admission of testimony from defendant's girlfriend about his misconduct toward her was harmless, as the jury had before it other strong evidence of defendant's guilt. In addition, because defendant had not invoked his right to remain silent by stating he was not ready to discuss everything he knew about the murder, an officer's testimony about those statements did not violate Doyle.</SPAN></P>

Finding no constitutional right to &quot;suitable&quot; educational opportunities, the trial court struck three counts of the complaint. The high court agreed with the trial court that the case was justiciable and did not present a political question, as the judicial role was limited to deciding whether existing public educational systems satisfied an articulated constitutional standard. Conn. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, entitled students to an education suitable to give them the opportunity to be responsible citizens. To satisfy this standard, the State, through the local school districts, had to provide students an objectively meaningful opportunity to receive the benefits of this constitutional right. Further proceedings were required to determine whether the State in fact provided plaintiff students with constitutionally suitable educational opportunities.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed with the State that the record was inadequate to review that claim, as the only evidence in the record consisted of two passing references by the judge that there had been such a meeting. Defendant also argued that prior accepting counsel's invocation of Rule 3.3(a)(3), the judge improperly failed to conduct an inquiry on the record to determine whether counsel's &quot;knowledge&quot; met the requirements of the rule. The supreme court agreed with the State that the rules require &quot;actual knowledge&quot; and not a &quot;reasonable belief&quot; by counsel that his client intended to commit perjury, and further noted that defendant's failure to contest the factual representation giving rise to the dilemma demonstrated his acquiescence to counsel's statement.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-94(a)), and risk of injury to a child. He appealed. The Connecticut Appellate Court reversed in part, finding that &sect; 53a-94(a) was unconstitutional as applied to the facts and that the evidence was insufficient to support the risk of injury conviction. The State appealed the reversal of defendant's kidnapping conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant stopped his car and ordered a 12-year-old girl to get inside.

She bit him, he released her, and she ran away again. Police found a rope noose and duct tape in the trunk of defendant's car. The high court held that &sect; 53a-94(a), which proscribed second degree kidnapping, was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct. Although his restraint of the victim was brief, when it was viewed along with the strong evidence of his specific intent to prevent her liberation, his claim that he was unaware of the criminality of his behavior, or that he was a victim of arbitrary enforcement, failed. The exclusion of the sworn statement of the victim's mother as substantive evidence under State v. Whelan did not deny defendant his right to present a defense under U.S. Const. amend. VI. Although the mother's prior inconsistent statement met the criteria of Whelan and was not itself hearsay, it nevertheless contained within it another level of hearsay for which no hearsay exception applied.</SPAN></P>

In a cross-appeal, the owners claim that the trial court improperly denied them attorney's fees and costs in connection with the valuation appeal. The &sect; 1983 action arose from the town's taking of certain real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owners were the title holders of the property at the time of the taking, and the developer had entered into an option contract with the owners to purchase the property. The property had been used for over 10 years as a landfill, and the developer had sought to obtain approval for the residential development of the property. The taking of the property was a result of the developer's various unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval of its development plans. The court held that because the developer's unexercised option to purchase the land was not considered a property interest under Connecticut state law, the developer's contractual right was not a property right protected by the federal takings clause, U.S. Const. amend. V. Since the developer lacked a property interest protected under the takings clause, the court addressed on the claims on appeal with respect to the owners. The court held that the issues litigated in the &sect; 1983 action were not identical to the issues decided in the valuation appeal and that the owners were not awarded double damages. The court held that the owners were not precluded from recovering money damages in the &sect; 1983 suit and the valuation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the owners and affirmed the award of attorney's fees to the owners for work performed in the discrimination action. The court reversed the denial of attorney's fees to the owners for work performed in connection with the valuation appeal, and remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination of reasonable attorney's fees in connection with that case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant town appealed from the order of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which granted plaintiff applicants' motion for class certification. Plaintiffs brought suit alleging violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-130i  and 7-148, Conn. Const. art. 10, and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq., arising from the town's collection of building permit fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs also initially asserted a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. Plaintiffs were all building companies who had applied for a building permit. Plaintiffs asserted that the revenues derived by the town from the payment of building permit fees were significantly in excess of the cost to the town of regulating building activity, and that the town unlawfully used the fees to fund other initiatives that bore no relationship to the regulation of building activity. The trial court had dismissed all of the non-CUTPA counts of the complaint. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify and certified a class consisting of entities that directly paid to the town the allegedly excessive building permit fees during a certain time period. The court held that neither party addressed whether a CUTPA claim may be brought against a municipality, and, as a result, the trial court did not rule on that issue when it certified the class. Accordingly, in the absence of any statutory or other authority to the contrary, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider that claim in the context of the town's interlocutory appeal. The court directed the town to file a motion to decertify the class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the trial court's order granting class certification and concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion for class certification of plaintiffs' CUTPA claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant paternal grandparents filed an application for visitation with their grandchildren pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59. The Superior Court, Judicial District of New Haven, Connecticut, denied their application and, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-62, ordered them to pay 85 percent of appellee mother's counsel fees and 90 percent of the fees of the children's court-appointed attorney. The grandparents appealed the fee awards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court dismissed the grandparents' application on grounds they failed to prove that they had a relationship with the children similar to a parent-child relationship or that dismissal would cause the children significant harm. While the grandparents' ultimately unsuccessful appeal of this order was pending, the mother filed a motion for attorney's fees; the trial court sua sponte appointed counsel to represent the children regarding the fee issue. The trial court, after noting the parties' respective financial abilities, entered the fee awards at issue. The high court held that &sect; 46b-62 did not authorize an award of attorney's fees against third parties petitioning for visitation under &sect; 46b-59. As the fee award did not relate to the merits of the visitation petition, and as the pending appeal continued the trial court's jurisdiction over preliminary jurisdictional matters, the trial court retained jurisdiction to appoint an attorney for the children under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-54. However, it abused its discretion by appointing an attorney for the children for a proceeding intended solely to address attorney's fees, an issue in which they lacked a direct interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with direction to deny the mother's motion for attorney's fees, to vacate the sua sponte appointment of an attorney for the minor children, and for further proceedings in which it was to consider the propriety of a refund of appointed counsel's fees, or to entertain other sources from which counsel could be compensated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellee Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission found that appellant board of selectmen violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-225(d) of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-200 et seq., by holding a special meeting without giving 24 hours notice to the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a town employee threatened to kill a selectman, the board convened an &quot;emergency&quot; meeting without notifying the public. The employee met with the board and was told that if he did not resign, he would be placed on leave pending an investigation. He chose to retire instead; the board voted to accept his &quot;resignation.&quot; He filed a complaint alleging the board violated &sect; 1-225(d), which required it to give the public 24 hours notice before convening a special meeting. The Commission agreed and declared the resignation null and void. The high court held that, in view of evidence that the selectman did not perceive the employee's threat as real, the Commission properly found that there had been no emergency under &sect; 1-225(d) to justify the lack of notice. Any error by the trial court in finding facts outside of the record was harmless, as it did not likely affect the result. That &sect; 1-225(d) did not define &quot;emergency&quot; and that the Commission failed to adopt regulations defining that term did not render &sect; 1-225(d) void for vagueness, as the dictionary definition provided clear notice that an emergency involved a serious, unexpected situation that required immediate attention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Learning that his 11-year-old son had pushed a teacher at school, defendant demanded that he explain his actions. The son testified that after he did so, defendant grabbed him by his shirt, and that he ducked and scraped his face against defendant's ring, resulting in a facial bruise. The trial court instructed the jury on the parental justification defense as it applied to the disorderly conduct and assault charges, but instructed the jury that the defense did not apply to the risk of injury charge. Defendant was acquitted on the former charges, but convicted of risk of injury. The high court held that the parental justification defense could apply to a risk-of-injury charge. Defendant was entitled to an instruction on that defense because the State's witnesses, including the son, injected the issue of parental justification into the trial sufficiently to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury as to whether defendant's actions were justified as parental discipline. As the trial court instructed the jury that this defense did not apply, there was a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict; thus,  defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate claimed that he had a liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, in receiving a sentence that was proportional to the sentences of similarly situated offenders. The high court held that as the review division's decision to uphold the sentence was a final judgment not otherwise appealable pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;  51-196(d), a writ of error was authorized by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 721(a)(4). And as the inmate was not challenging the result but the adequacy of the procedures the review division employed, the high court had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the writ of error. As defendants had no substantive right to a particular sentence within the range authorized by statute, there was no Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in receiving a sentence within the authorized range that was &quot;proportionate&quot; to that of similarly situated offenders. Neither Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-91a(c) nor Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 43-28 required the trial court or the review division to consider sentences imposed on other offenders; therefore, &sect; 43-28 did not create a liberty interest in a proportionate sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff company appealed the judgment by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut) which granted defendant Department of Transportation's (DOT) motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The company asserted that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss based on the company's claims being barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The company requested the opportunity to lease and develop land immediately abutting its existing leasehold at the airport. The DOT commissioner issued a public invitation for proposals regarding the development of the parcel. The DOT and the company engaged in negotiations. The DOT subsequently notified the company that it was terminating the proposal process. Thereafter, the company sought damages and declaratory relief. The company failed to present its claims to the claims commissioner prior to filing the action. Because exhaustion of this alternative means of relief was a prerequisite to the trial court's jurisdiction, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider any of the company's claims. Thus, the appellate court held the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss as the breach of contract, fraud, and other claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The company's limited property interest in a contract with the DOT was not an entitlement to which due process protections apply. Although the company alleged that the DOT treated the competitor differently, it did not allege that the differential treatment was based on any impermissible consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, in response to requests to buy heroin, used a key to open a car trunk and handled drugs in the trunk. The high court held that this evidence was sufficient to prove he had control over the drugs and knew their character. Evidence of his delivery of the heroin to a companion who, at his request, tried to learn if a buyer was a police officer was sufficient to prove defendant and his companion conspired to sell drugs. The trial court ruled that the State had improperly charged defendant with being a persistent felony offender under &sect; 53a-40 rather than charging him with being a subsequent drug offender under &sect; 21a-278(b). As this ruling was based on purely legal grounds, not on a finding that the State had failed to prove its case, retrial of defendant on persistent drug offender charges was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. As the information referred to &sect; 21a-278(b), and as defendant understood he was charged as a subsequent offender under &sect; 21a-278(b), not as a persistent felony offender under &sect; 53a-40, the State was entitled to proceed to trial under &sect; 21a-278(b) despite the information's use of &quot;persistent&quot; instead of &quot;subsequent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment with respect to the persistent drug offender charge was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. The convictions on the other charges were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">As a result of an incident in which defendant abducted his former wife in her vehicle, he was charged with multiple offenses. Following a jury trial at which he was permitted to represent himself and during which there were questions about his competency, he was found guilty of kidnapping in the first degree, robbery in the third degree, robbery involving an occupied motor vehicle, and larceny in the third degree. Defendant then represented himself at a probation violation hearing, and the trial court found that he had violated conditions of probation previously imposed on him. The state supreme court found that he was entitled to a new probation violation hearing because the trial court failed to ensure that he had waived his right to counsel knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Regarding the criminal case, it found that the trial court did not violate his constitutional right to represent himself at trial, but that the case had to be remanded for the trial court to determine whether, even if he was competent to stand trial, he was separately competent pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

The trial court then sentenced him to 20 years in prison, with execution suspended after 10 years followed by 10 years of probation. Defendant appealed that sentence. He claimed that the substitution of the probation term for the special parole term originally imposed unconstitutionally enlarged the sentence. The state supreme court found that the substitution violated his Fifth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 due process rights because the calculation for a probation violation as opposed to a special parole violation impermissibly enlarged the confines of his original sentence, thus requiring he be resentenced. It further found defendant's double jeopardy rights under the Fifth Amendment and Conn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The former husband had substantial business interests and, thus, the parties while divorcing executed a confidentiality agreement barring her from disseminating information about the divorce or from making any related disparaging remarks.

The trial court following a hearing found that the confidentiality agreement was enforceable. The former wife primarily asserted on appeal that the agreement violated her federal and state constitutional rights. The state supreme court found that (1) the parties' separation agreement did not supersede and nullify the confidentiality agreement because the two agreements covered different matters; (2) the confidentiality agreement did not violate the former wife's free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">During the course of the litigation, the towns filed a motion for relief for improper communications, alleging that the agency had misleading information suggesting that the towns had the power to bring the suit to a halt. The trial court ordered that agency desist from any further communications with the towns regarding the lawsuit except upon prior approval of the court. A court trial was held. Prior to the court rendering judgment, the agency posted statements on its website. The motion for contempt alleged that the website posting was an improper attempt to contact the towns. The agency claimed that it was denied due process of law as it was not afforded adequate notice of the motion and a meaningful opportunity to prepare a defense. The appellate court held that as the agency was given less than one day to consider a motion for contempt, which consisted of four pages of allegations, exhibits totaling in excess of a dozen pages and a request for sanctions, there was a denial of due process. While it was unclear whether a different result would have been reached had the agency been given more time, a denial of due process of law could not be justified by that uncertainty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Connecticut Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction entered after a jury found defendant guilty of, inter alia, first-degree kidnapping. After the state supreme court reversed the appellate court's judgment and found defendant was entitled to reversal of that conviction in light of a recent state supreme court decision in another case, the state supreme court granted the State's motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">As a result of two separate alleged sexual assaults of female employees,  defendant, the owner of a bakery where they worked, was charged with, inter alia, one count of first-degree kidnapping. After a jury trial, he was convicted of first-degree kidnapping in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A). While his case was on appeal, the state supreme court found in another case that a defendant could not be convicted of first-degree kidnapping unless a jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the restraint involved in committing that crime was not merely incidental to and necessary to commit another crime against the victim. The state supreme court then found that defendant consequently was entitled to reversal of his first-degree kidnapping conviction. The state supreme court then granted the State's motion for reconsideration. It agreed with the State upon reconsideration that the State should be allowed at its election to retry defendant on that charge or, alternatively, should be allowed to obtain a judgment of conviction against defendant on the lesser included offense of unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-96.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant employee challenged the Appellate Court (Connecticut)'s affirmance of a trial court's judgment of dismissal, claiming error in interpreting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46a-60 and 46a-70 to bar her employment discrimination case under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Appellees, the employer and its employees, agreed that &sect; 46a-60 was misconstrued, claimed that &sect; 46a-70 was properly construed, and that collateral estoppel barred the claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that the claims under &sect; 46a-70 were erroneously reviewed because the appellate court lacked jurisdiction; the claims had not been appealed and were moot. The &sect; 46a-60 claim was not moot because it was raised on appeal. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-100 expressly waived sovereign immunity and created a cause of action in the superior court for claims alleging a violation of &sect; 46a-60 over which the claims commission had released jurisdiction. Although the &sect; 46a-60 claim was not procedurally barred, the substantive claim was collaterally estopped. With respect to claims previously brought in the district court under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12111 et seq.; 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 2000e-2; &sect; 46a-58(a); &sect; 46a-60(a)(1) and &sect; 46a-70(a), there was no material fact issue that the challenged acts were motivated by discriminatory intent. The employee had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the elements underlying her &sect; 46a-60 claim at the district court and failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination. There was no reason to depart from the doctrine of collateral estoppel to allow relitigation in the superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed that part of the decision pertaining to &sect; 46-70 and remanded the case to the appellate court with directions to dismiss that part of the appeal concerning those claims; the court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court properly dismissed the embalmer's and the funeral home's appeal from the summary suspension of the license and certificate on the ground of mootness; (2) the embalmer's and the funeral home's challenge to the Board's decisions allowing the Department to amend the charges were properly rejected; (3) the embalmer and the funeral home failed to undertake the steps necessary to have the appellate court review their bias claim; (4) the Board acted properly in its factual determinations; and (5) the Board did not abuse its discretion under Conn.

He elected to be tried by the trial court. At the close of the State's case, he filed a motion for judgment of acquittal.

The trial court then found defendant guilty on all of the drug charges against him, including those under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b). The state supreme court found that the trial court correctly ruled that defendant had to prove by a preponderance of evidence that he was drug dependent.

The trial court determined that one factor cited in defendant's decision was not supported by the record and ordered the case remanded. On appeal, plaintiff raised several issues, including constitutional challenges to the registry statute. The court held that the trial court improperly determined that one of the factors relied on by defendant, namely that the case of abuse was not an isolated incident, was not supported by the evidence as the record in fact supported the hearing officer's finding that the episode with the juvenile was not an isolated incident. The court found no merit to plaintiff's constitutional challenges to the registry statute, finding that the parameters of &sect; 17a-101k were sufficiently clear to guide defendant in light of the aim of the legislation and did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court further found that the registry scheme did not violate due process nor did it constitute a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 21a-277(a) without first obtaining a plea from defendant or conducting a trial on the issue as Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 42-2 required.

The court agreed. Although the trial court's failure to comply with the &sect; 42-2 procedures was error, the appellate court abused its discretion in vacating the sentence; the error did not result in manifest injustice. Defendant did not contest the validity of his prior conviction. His brief was bereft of a single reason why the absence of a trial or plea canvass on part B of the information was an obvious error. To the extent that some appellate court cases suggested a per se rule that all violations of the rules of practice were plain error, those cases were mistaken. Regardless of &sect; 42-2's dictates, due process did not require a separate trial or  proceeding when the fact of a prior conviction was essentially uncontested. Defendant had no constitutional right to a trial on the issue of his prior conviction. A waiver of trial on that issue was not of constitutional dimension. The self-incrimination right was not implicated. Defendant had an opportunity to confront his accusers as to the alleged fact of his prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-127(a), the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven, Juvenile Matters (Connecticut) transferred defendant's Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a murder and weapons cases to the regular criminal docket, where his motion to dismiss or to transfer the case back to the juvenile docket was denied. He appealed his conviction on both charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant renewed his Roper claim that the application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a(2)'s mandatory minimum sentence for murder violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII. He also claimed that his right to a fair trial was violated by the prosecutor's suggestion of a motive for murdering the victim when no motive evidence was presented at trial. The court rejected both claims. Because it was not cruel and unusual punishment to mandate a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release in the case of a juvenile offender, it was not cruel and unusual punishment to mandate a sentence of not less than 25 years' imprisonment in defendant's case. Even if the court assumed that the prosecutor's argument was improper, any impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The suggestion that defendant and another person shared a common motive bordered on the speculative because any link between the conduct of the two men was weak at best. No direct evidence supported the argument, and it was debatable whether circumstantial evidence sufficiently warranted the inference of a common motive. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The health center was an entity operated by the State. The patient claimed that laser fibers were left in his body during a surgery performed at the health center by its employees. The trial court found that the claim was untimely presented under the one year limitation period of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148. The patient argued that, although he learned of the presence of the fibers a year earlier, actionable harm did not occur until he discovered the causal connection between the health center's negligence and the presence of the fibers. The appellate court disagreed. The one year limitation period began to run when the patient discovered the presence of the fibers. Contrary to the patient's argument, his knowledge of injury constituted actionable harm despite the absence of an expert medical opinion. The knowledge of the presence of fibers indicated professional negligence so gross as to be clear even to a lay person. 2005 Conn. Acts 05-4, &sect; 1(a) (Spec. Sess.), which allowed the patient to resubmit his notice of claim despite his untimely filing, was an unconstitutional public emolument because it served no public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Superior Court in the judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut) acquitted defendant on a charge of interfering with an officer, but found him guilty of multiple drug offenses, including five counts of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b). The superior court denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal with as to the &sect; 21a-278(b) charges. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that drug dependency was an affirmative defense, and not an element of the offense or an aggravating factor; therefore, it was not unconstitutional to require defendant to prove drug dependency by a preponderance of the evidence under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21a-278(b) and 21a-269. In fact, defendant presented overwhelming evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the offenses. The trial court applied an improper evidentiary standard in determining whether defendant was drug-dependent, as defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-240(18). Although a remand was ordinarily required to apply the correct standard, no reasonable fact finder could have concluded that defendant was not drug-dependent at the time of his discharge from treatment in April, 2001, or that, after years of dependence on drugs, he finally had managed to conquer his addiction at some point during the five months between that date and the date of the first offense. As a matter of law, defendant met his burden of proving that he was a drug-dependent person under &sect; 21a-278(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment as to the conviction of five counts of sale of narcotics by a person who was not drug-dependent and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal on those charges only and to resentence defendant on the remaining charges; the judgments were affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The uncle told the task force members that the package belonged to defendant and that he had accepted a package for defendant every two or three weeks. In exchange for that service, defendant gave marijuana to his uncle. Defendant arrived at the apartment and took possession of the package. The task force members then arrested him. When they searched him, they found a cellular telephone and nearly $ 1,000 in cash. Defendant testified that he never had sold any of the marijuana but used it all himself. Defendant claimed that the prosecutor's statements were improper as they were intended to mislead the jury by means of an artfully deceptive argument. The appellate court held prosecutor's reference to &quot;ingenuity of counsel&quot; was improper. However, that impropriety did not deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial as the statement was isolated and was not directed at a critical issue.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that as the father's claim raised the question of whether &sect; 46b-69b infringed on his fundamental right as a parent to raise his children free from unnecessary governmental interference, the claim raised an issue of public importance and fell under the exception to the mootness doctrine for claims that evaded review. The appellate court held that &sect; 46b-69b did not infringe on his fundamental right to exercise care, custody and control over his child. Nothing in the statute required parents to change the way that they cared for their children. Nothing in the statute authorized the State to deprive parents of control or custody of their children. Moreover, the education program did not involve the children themselves. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-69b was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, that is, the State's legitimate interest in promoting the welfare of children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, eight same-sex couples, commenced an action claiming that the state statutory prohibition against same sex marriage, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-38nn, violated their rights to substantive due process and equal protection under the state constitution. The Connecticut trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of defendants, state and local officials, and the couples appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court concluded that, in light of the history of pernicious discrimination faced by gay men and lesbians, and because the institution of marriage carried with it a status and significance that the classification of civil unions did not embody, the segregation of heterosexual and homosexual couples into separate institutions constituted a cognizable harm. Also, (1) the state scheme discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, (2) for the same reasons that classifications predicated on gender were considered quasi-suspect for purposes of the equal protection provisions of the U.S. constitution, sexual orientation constituted a quasi-suspect classification for purposes of the equal protection provisions of the state constitution, and, therefore, state statutes discriminating against gay persons were subject to heightened or intermediate judicial scrutiny, and (3) the state failed to provide sufficient justification for excluding same sex couples from the institution of marriage. As the state's disparate treatment of same sex couples was deficient under an intermediate level of scrutiny, the couples' claims implicating a stricter standard of review were not reached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with direction to grant the couples' motion for summary judgment and application for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Following the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to the charges of possession of narcotics with intent to sell and possession of marijuana. Defendant was sentenced to six years imprisonment and six years of special parole. The Appellate Court (Connecticut) reversed the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress. The State, on the granting of certification, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The sole issue before the appellate court was whether the appellate court properly concluded that defendant was seized within the meaning of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 9, when two uniformed, armed police officers exited their patrol car and approached his vehicle. The State argued that the officer's conduct would not have caused a reasonable person in defendant's position to believe he was not free to leave. The supreme court concluded that there was an insufficient show of police authority before the officers detected the smell of marijuana to establish a seizure under the Connecticut Constitution. The officers were dispatched to investigate an anonymous report of a suspicious vehicle and, upon seeing a vehicle matching the description in the report, the officers parked behind defendant's vehicle. At no time prior to detecting the smell of marijuana did the officers activate their overhead flashing lights, shine spotlights or activate sirens, or direct any verbal commands to defendant. The officer's mere presence did not constitute the requisite show of authority sufficient to cause a reasonable person in defendant's position to believe he was not free to leave.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After being found not competent to stand trial, defendant was confined in a mental health facility pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56d(i) for three nonconsecutive periods totaling 21 months. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Ansonia-Milford (Connecticut) rejected his claim that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was arrested and initially charged with violating Conn. Gen.

Because none of defendant's individual treatment periods restoring him to competency had exceeded 18 months, the trial court denied his request for a release from custody or a hearing pursuant to &sect; 54-56d(m). On appeal, he claimed that the placements had to be treated cumulatively for purposes of applying the 18-month time limitation of &sect; 54-56d(i). The court found that defendant was entitled to appeal from the interlocutory order under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-263 because his claim that the 18-month period of &sect; 54-56d(i) had been exceeded and that he was entitled either to immediate release or to civil commitment proceedings implicated a constitutional due process right, embodied in &sect; 54-56d, already secured to him. The court construed &sect; 54-56d(i) to mean that after a defendant was found incompetent to stand trial but restorable to competency, the cumulative total of the placements for treatment could not exceed the period of the maximum sentence that defendant could receive or 18 months, whichever was less.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In separate certified appeals, the State challenged the judgment of the Appellate Court (Connecticut), which reversed defendant's conviction for kidnapping, claiming that the court improperly concluded that the kidnapping statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Defendant appealed from that part of the judgment affirming his conviction for sexual assault and kidnapping, violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-70(a)(1) and 53a-92(a)(2)(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that the appellate court should have determined whether the facts concerning a first assault could have supported a kidnapping conviction. The court overruled its conclusion in State v. Sanseverino that there should have been a judgment of acquittal; the proper remedy was a new trial with instructions that, to find defendant guilty of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree, it had to find that he had intended to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which was necessary to commit the underlying crime. Because defendant could have been convicted on the basis of conduct which, under Salamon, did not violate the kidnapping statute, the kidnapping conviction was properly reversed, but remanded for a new trial. The court declined to consider whether the kidnapping statute was void for vagueness. The admission of prior sexual assault act evidence was not error; the court adopted the liberal admission of prior sexual assault acts to prove that defendant had a propensity or a tendency to sexually assault young women of limited mental ability with whom he worked and over whom he had supervisory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment that directed a judgment of not guilty of kidnapping in the first degree under count four of the information and remanded the case to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial on that count; the court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the city could adopt the ordinance, that the association lacked standing to challenge the city's power to obtain an administrative warrant to compel certain inspections, that the ordinance did not violate the property owners' right to procedural or substantive due process, and that it did not take property without just compensation. The state supreme court found that (1) the statute's broad grant of police power authorized adoption of the ordinance, (2) the association lacked standing to challenge the administrative warrant provision because it lacked a privacy interest in the units, (3) the ordinance did not deprive the property owners of the benefit of a certificate of occupancy and, thus, did not violate procedural or substantive due process rights, and (4) the regulatory requirements imposed did not take any alleged property interest.</SPAN></P>

The inmate claimed that retroactive application of the court's interpretation of Conn. Gen.

The trilogy did not change the law, but construed the statute based on a legislative intent to change from a system that awarded multiple credit for presentence confinement. The correct application of &sect; 18-98d had been unsettled until the trilogy, and resolution of inconsistent holdings in the trilogy was foreseeable. The Commissioner's recalculation was akin to the correction of a clerical error.

The appellate court held that the trial court had improperly denied his motion to sever. It rejected his vagueness claim regarding the kidnapping statute. The state supreme court found that the cases could be joined because evidence of other acts would have been cross admissible at separate trials to show a common scheme or plan by defendant, making joinder was permissible pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-57 and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 41-19. However, it reversed the kidnapping conviction after finding the confinement used was merely incidental to the sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut) of one count each of kidnapping in the second degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-94, unlawful restraint in the first degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-95, and risk of injury to a child, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1) (Rev. to 2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The kidnapping was based on the restraint that occurred during an assault. Defendant's argued for a reconsideration of the principle stated in the 1977 Luurtsema decision that a conviction for kidnapping could be based on restraint that was merely incidental to the commission of a separate, underlying offense against a victim. The supreme court complied, ruling first that neither stare decisis nor concepts of legislative acquiescence precluded it from doing so. On the merits, the supreme court ruled that its prior construction of &sect; 53a-94 was incorrect and pronounced that to commit a kidnapping in conjunction with another crime, a defendant must have intended to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of timer or to a greater degree than that which was necessary to commit the other crime. As there was evidence that still might support defendant's conviction, a new trial by a properly instructed jury was required. While prosecutorial improprieties had occurred during defendant's trial, they did not implicate due process. Finally, while the trial court's instruction on the definition of intent was incomplete, the jury charge in its entirety was not misleading.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court reversed only as to the conviction of kidnapping in the second degree and remanded the case for a new trial on that count. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the water company contended that the trial court improperly concluded that the board's determination that the water company failed to show the unusual hardship necessary to grant a variance was supported by substantial evidence. The water company presented no expert testimony or evidence to show that the well had to be discontinued due to high radon levels. The water company had no answers to questions regarding whether the water company could take measures to treat the level of radon or whether residents could treat the water themselves. The supreme court also found no merit in the water company's claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the board's denial of its application was not tantamount to a taking without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, noting that the water company failed to show it had been deprived of all beneficial use of the property.</SPAN></P>

Cat feces, vomit, and urine were spread throughout the house and there was not sufficient food for all the cats. The trial court rejected the cat owner's claim that the condition of the house was due to the fact that she had not been able to pick up as usual that morning, as the feces and urine had been there for some time and the clutter was junk or trash. The supreme court rejected the cat owner's claim that the trial court improperly determined that she neglected the cats under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22-329a, as the failure to give proper care or provide proper food to the cats constituted neglectful conduct under Conn. Gen.

The error was not harmless, as a properly instructed jury could have found that a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have foreseen that his statements and actions would be interpreted as a serious expression of an intent to harm but, rather, as mere banter, jest or exaggeration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Appellate Court (Connecticut) affirmed a trial court's denial of petitioner inmate's amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus in part and dismissed the appeal in part. The inmate appealed, claiming ineffective assistance in failing to object to, or to challenge on direct appeal, jury instructions that omitted the Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Certification was limited to whether the appellate court properly determined that the inmate was not denied effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. The court overruled its decision in Bunkley v. Commissioner of Correction, 222 Conn. 444, 447 n.4, 610 A.2d 598 (1992) to the extent that its analysis of Strickland's prejudice prong was inconsistent with Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S. Ct. 746, 145 L. Ed. 2d 756 (2000). The court applied its new rule and found that there was not a reasonable probability that, if the issue had been brought before the court on direct appeal, the inmate would have prevailed. The return of a guilty verdict on the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree indicated a finding that the inmate had the requisite intent. The inmate's presence at a victim's house was a substantial step corroborative of criminal intent. Because the State could have met its burden of showing that the omitted instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no reasonable probability that, absent the omitted instruction, the verdict would have been different.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a. He appealed the denial of his motions to suppress evidence seized as the result of a search warrant, for a Franks hearing, and to suppress statements. He also claimed prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that defendant's Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights had not been violated. The affidavit's facts were sufficient for a reasonable mind to believe that the Type O blood at the scene that did not belong to the victim belonged to the perpetrator. The facts also were sufficient for a reasonable mind to weigh the probability of an innocent explanation for the presence of defendant's fingerprint on a tissue box in a car, and to support a belief that an innocent explanation was no more likely than defendant's presence in the car at the time of the murder. A Franks hearing was not required, as the potentially exculpatory facts omitted from the affidavit were not material. Defendant's statements were not the result of an unlawful custodial interrogation. An officer's response to defendant's implicit questions as to the basis for his arrest did not constitute interrogation under Innis. The jury would not necessarily have found that a prosecutor's comment that there was no evidence of an innocent explanation for the fingerprint or DNA evidence was a comment on defendant's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged a judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial in the Connecticut trial court, of one count each of attempted sale of narcotics in violation of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant claimed that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him without a warrant moments after he drove into a parking lot, and that the search of his person and vehicle and the discovery of narcotics and other items of evidentiary interest incident to this arrest violated his rights under U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV. The supreme court found police had probable cause to believe that narcotics would be found either on defendant's person or in his vehicle upon his arrival at the parking lot. Accordingly, the search and seizure of defendant did not violate his constitutional rights, and defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. An informant's telephone calls to defendant in an officer's presence, in addition to the informant's choice of a location that the two had used previously, constituted &quot;firsthand information&quot; supporting an inference of the informant's basis of knowledge. The trial court's instructions to the jury prior to closing arguments did not unconstitutionally restrict his right to an effective closing argument. None of the cases cited by defendant supported the proposition that his claim was one of constitutional magnitude.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that the trial court's failure to conduct an adequate canvass to ensure that defendant's waiver of the right to counsel was made knowingly and intelligently constituted an abuse of discretion and, accordingly, required defendant be granted a new trial. The supreme court went on to address two of defendant's other arguments, as they were likely to arise upon retrial. As for defendant's contention that he was deprived of due process when he was arrested before the State took reasonable steps to contact him after he failed to return the verifications forms, the supreme court agreed with the State that defendant received full due process of law, having been formally apprised of his registration responsibilities, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-256. The supreme court also found no error in the jury instructions given as, inter alia, no instruction on mens rea was necessary since failure to register as a sex offender was a strict liability offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother, who was defendant's fiancee, caught defendant lying on top of the victim. She attempted to call the police, but defendant began choking and beating her. The victim gave the mother a letter that defendant wrote, expressing his sexual desire for the victim. Defendant took the letter and hid it in the bedroom he and the mother shared. When the police arrived the mother gave the letter to an officer. The supreme court held that the mother's search of the bedroom did not implicate federal or state constitutional protections because the mother was not an agent of the police when she retrieved the letter. Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the mother was not an agent of the police. Therefore, her actions did not constitute a police search. The police did not place the mother in a position to find the incriminating letter. She received it from the victim before defendant took it. The officer learned about the letter from her conversation with the victim and then asked the mother whether she could find it. There was no evidence that the police offered the mother any kind of reward, and the mother's initial contact with the police was self-motivated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff administratrix challenged an order of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), which granted defendant State summary judgment in her action alleging that the State's negligence contributed to a decedent's death. The trial court found that 1994 Conn. Acts 94-13, &sect; 1 (Spec. Sess.) could not extend the time in which her claim against the State could be presented under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(a)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decedent had been a superior court judge. Eight years after his death, the administratrix filed a claim with the State claims commissioner, seeking permission to sue the State for negligence. She had been authorized to file the otherwise untimely claim pursuant to 1994 Conn. Acts 94-13, &sect; 1 (Spec. Sess.). The commissioner denied the administratrix permission to file an action against the State, but the legislature authorized her to sue the State. The State filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the special act violated Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. The supreme court held that the trial court properly granted the State summary judgment. 1994 Conn. Acts 94-13, &sect; 1 (Spec. Sess.) conferred an exclusive public emolument on the administratrix and violated Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. The special act granted to the administratrix alone a personal right that was not generally available to others similarly situated. It benefited no member of the public other than the administratrix and remedied a procedural default arising from her failure to file a claim with the commissioner within three years from the date of the decedent's death pursuant to Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The jury reasonably found that defendant and the victim had a stepfather-stepdaughter relationship. The State introduced into evidence defendant's admission that at the time of the sexual assault, he was legally married to the victim's mother. The appellate court improperly relied on the Roswell decision to conclude that the State's failure to produce documentary evidence concerning the victim's parentage rendered the State's evidence legally insufficient. Roswell had been overruled sub silentio by subsequent supreme court cases. Therefore, defendant's admissions were admissible and sufficient, although not conclusive, evidence of a legal and valid familial relationship. Section 53a-72a(a)(2) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it applied equally to sexual intercourse between persons of both the opposite sex and the same sex who were related within certain degrees of kindred. Section 53a-72a(a)(2) incorporated only the proximity of relation specified therein and did not incorporate the precise male-female unions enumerated in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-21.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The president lacked standing to challenge the commission's decision. The society argued that the commission's decision to deny the society's application for a special exception was not supported by the record and violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-571b and the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq. The supreme court concluded, inter alia, that the trial court correctly found that the record did not contain substantial evidence to support the commission's conclusion that the society's application should be denied because the design of the temple was not in harmony with the design of other buildings in the vicinity and the temple would create unacceptable traffic congestion and hazards. However, the record contained substantial evidence to support the commission's denial of the society's application on the grounds that the level of activity at the proposed temple would not be in harmony with the general character of the neighborhood, that the temple would substantially impair neighboring property values, and that the proposed septic wastewater and water supply systems would create a health or safety hazard.</SPAN></P>

Although the supreme court agreed that a person may assert a reasonable expectation of privacy in packages addressed to them under an alias, defendant failed to present evidence to show that the addressee of the boxes was his alias rather than a real person.

Rather, they contended they only prove that they suffered an injury in fact that fell within the zone of interest of the laws claimed to have been violated. The supreme court concluded the trial court properly dismissed the residents' action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, inter alia, the allegations that the development of the condominium and pharmacy violated the neighborhood ordinance raised claims that fell within the scope of authority of the town's plan and zoning commission. In addition, the claimed injuries arising from the conveyance of the public park land were not sufficient to constitute a cognizable basis for standing, as the complaint failed to allege any direct injury to aesthetic or recreational interests. The supreme court further declined to extend the automatic standing rule to allow any citizen to bring an action to challenge any decision implicating urban sprawl.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a post-dissolution matter, defendant father challenged a judgment of the Appellate Court (Connecticut), affirming a trial court order modifying an original custody order by awarding joint custody to plaintiff mother and intervenor, the parties' child's aunt, and directing that the primary residence be with the aunt. The Appellate Court also found the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the allocation of tax dependency exemptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue was whether a third party could satisfy the jurisdictional pleading requirements and burden of persuasion articulated in Roth v. Weston when seeking the custody of a minor child over the objection of a fit parent. The supreme court agreed with the father that third party custody decisions (which presented different issues from those in visitation proceedings) required the application of a standard more demanding than the best interests of the child. However, the burden in Roth could not be applied to the relevant third party custody statutes (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46b-56(a), 46b-57, 46b-56b). The proper standard of proof was a fair preponderance of the evidence, because it comported with due process and the requirement of &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; described in Santosky v. Kramer. The trial court failed to apply the correct standard when it granted the aunt's motion to intervene and awarded her custody. Thereafter, the Appellate Court properly rejected the father's claim that the trial court should have awarded custody on the basis of the standard articulated in Roth but improperly affirmed the award of custody to the aunt on the ground that it was in the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the Appellate Court was affirmed insofar as it reversed the trial court's judgment as to the allocation of tax dependency exemptions; the judgment was reversed in all other respects and the case was remanded to that court with direction to reverse the trial court's judgment and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

The car manufacturer thereafter applied to the commissioner for a refund of the state sales tax it had paid pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-179(d). The commissioner denied the application. The trial court dismissed the car manufacturer's subsequent appeal. The state supreme court found that pursuant to Conn. Gen.

It also found that the state had not waived its sovereign immunity under Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff contractor filed an action for a writ of mandamus against defendants, the state comptroller and other officials. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) ordered defendants to pay $1.2 million to plaintiff under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-7(c).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">During the course of performance of a construction contract, disputes arose over extra costs. The parties reached a settlement, but plaintiff never received payment of the settlement amount. Plaintiff argued that defendants were not entitled to sovereign immunity because &sect; 3-7(c) required the officials to effect payment in the amount agreed upon in settlement of the claim once the governor had authorized that payment. In failing to do so, plaintiffs argued, they had acted in contravention of their authority under the statute. Reading the statute as a whole and considering its legislative history, the court held that &sect; 3-7(c) did not create a mandatory duty to pay a claimant. It created a chain of command to obtain proper authority to resolve a dispute. When a legislative provision was designed to secure order, system, and dispatch in the proceedings, it was generally held to be discretionary. The governor's certification of the amount to be paid conferred the power to settle on an official, and then set the limits of that authorization. The legislature did not intend for this authorization to create a mandatory duty in an official to pay a settlement of a disputed claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellants, the candidate and the petition circulators, sued appellees, the registrar of voters and the town clerk, in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut), claiming that the registrar improperly rejected, under Conn. Gen. Stat &sect; 9-410(c), petitions to secure the candidate's name on a primary ballot. The court rendered judgment for the registrar and the clerk. The candidate and the petition circulators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The registrar of voters rejected some of the petitions submitted on the candidate's behalf for the placement of the candidate's name on a primary ballot. The registrar then determined that the candidate had not obtained enough signatures on valid petitions to qualify for the ballot. The candidate claimed that (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410(c) was void for vagueness; and that (2) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410(c) was an unconstitutional restriction of free speech and associational rights. On appeal, the court found that, because the meaning of the challenged portion of &sect; 9-410(c) was clear from the statute's purpose, practical application, and legislative history, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. Moreover, because &sect; 9-410(c) made no distinction between bona fide candidates and placeholder candidates, it necessarily referred to any candidate. Finally, the provision of &sect; 9-410(c) that no person was to circulate petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position did not violate the right to free speech or association under U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff candidate, and others, sued defendant registrar, and others, claiming, inter alia, that, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410(c), the registrar improperly rejected certain petitions required to secure the candidate's name on the mayoral primary ballot. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford (Connecticut) entered judgment for the registrar, and certified questions to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Upon discovering that several persons who circulated petitions for the candidate also had circulated and submitted petitions for a challenge slate, which included a mayoral office seeker, the registrar rejected the petitions submitted by these circulators pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410(c). The candidate claimed that this was improper, and argued that because it was only when the circulators began circulating petitions for the challenge slate that the statute was violated, the registrar should have rejected only the petitions for the challenge slate. The appellate court disagreed. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410(c) was ambiguous, but it was reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended that the registrar would reject all of the petitions circulated by any one person as a disincentive to actions intended to siphon votes. The appellate court also rejected the candidate's claim that, because the challenge slate's mayoral office seeker was merely a placeholder, &sect; 9-410(c) was not violated. The trial court properly held that the registrar must presume that all office seekers were bona fide and must treat all petitions filed on their behalf the same for the purposes of &sect; 9-410(c).</SPAN></P>
