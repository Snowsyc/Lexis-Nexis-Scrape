A remand was solely for entry of corrected forms to reflect a single release eligibility of 100 percent for the his especially aggravated kidnapping convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand, the Circuit Court for Overton County, Tennessee, found petitioner's request for post-conviction relief was untimely under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102. However, it concluded that due process required the tolling of the limitations period as his trial counsel failed to withdraw under Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 14. It reviewed the merits of the petition and concluded that petitioner was not entitled to post-conviction relief. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On petitioner's appeal from the denial of his original petition, the court questioned the timeliness of the petition and remanded for a determination of whether it was in accordance with &sect; 40-30-102 or whether due process required tolling of the limitations period. The circuit court found that trial counsel's failure to file a motion to withdraw was a misrepresentation to petitioner of his intention to pursue an application for permission to appeal to the supreme court, which denied petitioner the right to seek post-conviction relief. Thus, the statute of limitations was tolled. While the court agreed that trial counsel made serious missteps in his representation of petitioner, it concluded that due process did not require the tolling of the limitations period. By his own admission, petitioner called trial counsel and knew he was on his own a couple of months after his convictions had been affirmed on direct appeal. At that point, he had nearly 10 months to timely file his petition. Thus, the circuit court improperly determined that the statute of limitations should be tolled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and dismissed the post-conviction relief petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that trial counsel failed to select appropriate experts, failed to supervise properly the experts they retained, and failed to provide the experts with the information necessary to evaluate defendant. The court upheld the decision. The court agreed with the post-conviction court's conclusion that trial counsel made a reasonably informed strategic decision to employ the services of a psychiatric evaluation expert. The expert never voiced concern to the trial attorneys about any conflict of interest regarding his involvement in first degree murder trial. Trial counsel weighed the negative impact that the expert's prior prison evaluations may have had on the jury. However, because the expert was intimately more familiar with defendant and because his opinion about the defendant's mental state at the time of the murder was extremely favorable to the defense theory of the case, trial counsel decided the positive aspects of the expert's testimony outweighed any negative implications regarding defendant's previous incarceration. Just because trial counsel's judgment might have been wrong was not sufficient to prove incompetent representation had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of second degree murder. After affirmance on direct appeal, petitioner's claim for post-conviction relief was denied and the decision was affirmed on appeal. The Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) denied petitioner's subsequent claim for post-conviction relief. Petitioner appealed and the State filed a motion requesting the court to affirm the post-conviction court's order pursuant to Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued, inter alia, that the Post-Conviction Procedure Act clearly provided that second or successive petitions must be summarily dismissed. The State claimed that because the petitioner's first post-conviction petition was heard and decided on its merits and the petitioner was able to appeal that decision, the new post-conviction petition failed to present any meritorious grounds for relitigating this case. The court of criminal appeals agreed. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(c), in no event may more than one (1) petition for post-conviction relief be filed attacking a single judgment. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(c), if a prior petition had been filed, which was resolved on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, any second or subsequent petition &quot;shall&quot; be summarily dismissed. Petitioner's first post-conviction petition was resolved on its merits and the lower court acted properly in summarily dismissing her second post-conviction petition on that basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a summary dismissal by the Lauderdale County Circuit Court (Tennesssee) of his pro se petition for habeas corpus relief from his conviction for especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of the Tennessee Protection of Children Against Sexual Explotation Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1005(a) (Supp. 2000) (amended 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by finding that the judgment was not void and by dismissing his petition without an evidentiary hearing and without appointment of counsel. Specifically, defendant argued that the State violated constitutional ex post facto prohibitions when it charged him under the Tennessee Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act (PCSEA), Tenn. Code Ann, &sect; 39-17-1005(a) (Supp. 2000) (amended 2005). The court upheld the decision. Defendant argued that he did not waive constitutional issues by pleading guilty because his plea was not voluntary. He claimed that the trial court failed to explain the consequences of violating probation at the guilty plea proceedings. The court held that voluntariness of the guilty plea was not relevant to a habeas corpus proceeding as a matter of law. Accordingly, defendant's claim regarding the constitutionality of the statute was previously decided on post-conviction appeal and was not appropriate for habeas corpus relief. The court also found that the indictment was sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the trial court even though the statute mentioned in the indictment had changed.</SPAN></P>

The evidence established that defendant thought the victim had burglarized his apartment and had taken eight hundred dollars and some tools. By defendant's own admission, he was &quot;mad.&quot; Defendant allegedly believed the victim was dangerous. However, instead of contacting the police, defendant got a gun and went to the motel to confront the victim. He forced his way into the victim's motel room, and beat the victim with the weapon. Defendant did not find any of his property in the victim's room. Although he claimed he only wanted the victim to return his property, he then kidnapped the unarmed victim and continued beating the victim in the car. The medical examiner's testimony established that defendant beat the victim severely, causing skull fractures, hemorrhaging under the scalp, and brain contusions. When the victim escaped from the car, defendant followed and shot him at least six times. Defendant then drove to a store where he bought cleaning supplies and cleaned the victim's blood off the backseat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain her convictions. The court of appeals disagreed. It was undisputed that the victim was under eight years old and suffered serious bodily injury. During the time of his abuse and up to his death, the victim was in the exclusive care of defendant and the co-defendant. The victim was visibly injured and in need of medical attention. The co-defendant and defendant knew that the victim needed medical attention, yet neither of them sought medical treatment for the victim. When asked why he did not take the child to the doctor, the co-defendant stated, &quot;since he was not the victim's father he did not have any reason to want to make the victim get better.&quot; Whenever someone expressed concern about the victim's condition, defendant provided excuses, which the medical testimony refuted, and fled with the co-defendant. There was no evidence that the co-defendant coerced the defendant or that defendant attempted to report the abuse or otherwise prevent the victim from being further abused. Moreover, after the victim's death, defendant fled to Mexico.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought review of the dismissal of his second petition for writ of habeas corpus by the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee). Petitioner argued that his sentence, requiring a 100 percent release eligibility, was unconstitutional and was contrary to the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989. The habeas corpus court summarily dismissed the petition based upon the fact that petitioner had previously raised the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court sentenced petitioner to thirty-six years to be served at 100 percent for his conviction of possession with intent to sell. On review, the court noted that the formal requirements for a petition for a writ of habeas corpus were set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-107. The court stated that the issues raised by petitioner had been previously adjudicated on the appeal from his first petition for writ of habeas corpus. On appeal of the denial of that petition, the court had determined that petitioner was mistaken that he was not required to serve 100 percent of the minimum sentence for the applicable range. Nothing on the face of the judgment in the record indicated that the trial court was without authority to impose an enhanced sentence pursuant to the Drug-Free School Zone statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432(c). The court concluded that its previous adjudication of the issues in question barred petitioner from raising the same issues again in his second habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed that red flags listed by petitioner necessarily triggered the need for a neuropsychological evaluation, and did not find that trial counsel was deficient for not requesting one. Trial counsel testified that neither petitioner, his family, nor anyone else ever indicated that petitioner had any type of emotional or psychological problems or mental illness, disease, or defect. Even if trial counsel was deficient in failing to order a neuropsychological evaluation, petitioner failed to show that he was prejudiced. Petitioner also contended that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve for appellate review the trial court's exclusion of evidence regarding petitioner's lack of remorse. However, the post-conviction court found that because the testimony would have come from petitioner's mother rather than petitioner, the jury would have given it little weight. The appeals court concluded that petitioner failed to demonstrate entitlement to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) of assault and disorderly conduct. Defendant was sentenced to eleven-months, twenty-nine days on probation for the assault conviction and to thirty days on probation for the disorderly conduct conviction, with the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in not granting a mistrial after substituting a previously excused alternate for a disqualified juror under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 24. The court of criminal appeals agreed. Defendant did not waive the issue and the procedure violated defendant's constitutional and statutory rights. The trial court substituted a previously discharged juror and instructed the jury to restart its deliberations. That procedure was not only unauthorized by statute or rule, but it was specifically condemned. The trial court expressly and properly discharged the alternate juror after releasing the jury to deliberate. At that point, the discharged alternate was no longer a member of the jury. In short, the procedure the trial court used to later recall the alternate was incorrect. However, especially given the court's instruction to bring the alternate &quot;up to speed,&quot; the instruction more naturally read as though the alternate was to be briefed on what had transpired in the deliberations rather than as though the deliberations were to start again from scratch. Therefore, the trial court erred in substituting the alternate juror for the disqualified juror.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his various drug convictions and the appellate court concluded that two of the convictions violated his double jeopardy protections. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed. The evidence proved that defendant and another male conspired to sell more than 300 grams of cocaine. The confidential informant contacted the male on several occasions to ask to purchase drugs and both the male and defendant testified that the male then relayed to defendant the details of his conversations with the confidential informant, including the quantity of drugs the informant wished to purchase and the location of the agreed meeting place. Defendant's conviction in Count 7 for the possession of cocaine was improper because he was simultaneously in possession of the cocaine in his home, that was left there when he divided the cocaine to sell the correct amount to the State's confidential informant, and the cocaine that he possessed at the time of that sale. He was convicted for the sale of cocaine, and one must necessarily &quot;possess&quot; cocaine in order to sell that same cocaine. Thus, there was a double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree premeditated murder and his sentence of life in prison, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that defendant acted with premeditation. Defendant was calm shortly after the killing and he returned to a friend's house, got in bed, and told her that he had killed the victim, with whom he had a child. Defendant then went to sleep, woke up, and engaged in normal daily activities. The victim was also unarmed and shot repeatedly in the back of her head. Defendant had a motive for killing the victim in that the two were involved in a highly contested custody dispute and defendant admittedly &quot;hated&quot; the victim. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the evidence that a female communicated with the victim via a hoax MySpace page and was in Tennessee on the weekend of the victim's murder was not relevant. The female explained the reason she created the MySpace page, and her communications with the victim were benign.</SPAN></P>

The record did not support a conclusion that the jurors impaneled were incompetent. Witness testimony delineating defendant's prior bad acts was relevant to establishing a motive for the murders. Considering, however, the numerous admonitions of the trial court to abstain from graphic testimony regarding the nature of the alleged act, the trial court clearly intended to specifically limit that witness's testimony regarding the details of the alleged incident. However, while the information was prejudicial, the danger of unfair prejudice did not outweigh the probative value of the testimony. The proof at trial showed that defendant had a motive for the killing because he blamed one of the victims for the accusation of child sexual abuse. Defendant had threatened to kill that victim prior to the murder, procured a gun substantially similar to the murder weapon just before the murder, and defendant confessed to killing the victims to several witnesses. That was sufficient to show premeditation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When she was 16 years old, petitioner plead guilty to two counts of felony murder and one count of attempted first degree murder. She filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was summarily dismissed by the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, because her petition was barred by the statute of limitations. Petitioner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that the statute of limitations was tolled due to her minority status. The post-conviction court found that her minority status alone was not sufficient to toll the statute of limitations under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a). The court found that the precise issue was whether petitioner was misled by prison officials to believe that her minority status prevented her from filing a petition or tolled the limitations period, which, if true, would entitle her to equitable tolling of the filing period. The court found that petitioner delivered her petition to prison officials within one year from the date she reached majority age and that she appeared to be grossly uneducated. The court concluded that the post-conviction relief court erred in dismissing her petition without conducting a hearing to determine whether due process considerations tolled the statute of limitations based on the alleged actions of the prison officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether due process tolled the statute of limitations so as to give petitioner a reasonable opportunity after the expiration of the limitations period to present her claim in a meaningful time and manner, and if so, whether petitioner's filing of her post-conviction petition was within the reasonable opportunity afforded by the due process tolling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate appealed from the denial in part of his petition for postconviction relief and simultaneous order of a delayed appeal. The postconviction court determined that appellate counsel was ineffective and granted a delayed appeal. It was further determined that trial counsel were effective. The inmate argued on appeal that the postconviction court erred by not setting aside his conviction for felony murder and granting a new trial. The appellate court reversed the postconviction court's determination that trial counsel provided effective assistance of counsel, vacated the inmate's conviction, and remanded for a new trial. The inmate was deprived the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Trial counsel was deficient in failing to request an instruction on second-degree murder and in failing to preserve the issue for appeal. Even though the evidence was clearly sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder, the inmate's conduct also showed that he was criminally responsible for second-degree murder. The error was not harmless because the jury was deprived of the option of considering whether the offense applied, which impaired their truth-ascertainment function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant pled guilty to one count of possession of more than 300 grams of cocaine with the intent to sell and one count of possession of more than 300 grams of cocaine with the intent to deliver, but reserved a certified question as to the denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) imposed a total effective sentence of 18 years in prison. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant's convictions stemmed from the discovery of approximately 85 pounds of cocaine in his vehicle during a traffic stop for failing to slow down or move over while an officer's car was on the side of the road. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the basis that he was placed in the patrol car for a minor traffic violation and that, the subsequent search of his car was unconstitutional. The arresting officer acknowledged that the defendant appeared to have appropriate papers and that he had no reason to believe another crime was being committed until he became suspicious of possible criminal activity because of the defendant's defensive stance, nervousness, and fidgeting. The drugs were discovered initially by a dog sniff during a time reasonably required for the officer to complete the traffic stop. The dog's alerts gave the officer probable cause to search the defendant's car. Dog sniffs are not searches. There was no basis on which to suppress the drugs discovered during the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed from the post-conviction judgment of the Criminal Court for Shelby County granting him partial post-conviction relief in the form of a delayed appeal from multiple aggravated rape, aggravated robbery, and facilitation of aggravated rape convictions that followed a spree of incidents participated in by the inmate and an accomplice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the post-conviction trial court's findings of ineffective assistance of the inmate's trial and appellate counsel, the court held that the offenses were signature offenses and properly consolidated by the original trial court. The inmate and his accomplice used the same methods to commit the offenses, including posing as customers of adult entertainment and preaching to victims after raping them. Counsel also was not shown to be ineffective regarding consecutive sentencing because references of the sentencing judge to the horrible nature of the crimes and the fairness of the aggregate 128-year term for the inmate contained sufficient, if less than precise, findings. However, appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by not raising the State's failure to elect offenses. The inmate was entitled to unanimous verdicts and when the State presented evidence showing more than one offense occurred, it was the responsibility of the trial court to require the State to elect which offense was being submitted to the jury. Also, to avoid convicting the inmate for acts of the accomplice, the State had to elect which acts were being relied on for the conviction of the inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the post-conviction court in part, vacated the inmate's convictions relating to four of the indictments against him, and remanded for new trials on those indictments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court for Sumner County (Tennessee), which, on the ground of the one-year statute of limitations, dismissed defendant's petition for a writ of error coram nobis, which alleged the existence of newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, in which he alleged the existence of newly discovered evidence. The trial court dismissed the petition based upon the statute of limitations of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-103. On appeal, defendant contended the dismissal was an unconstitutional denial of his right to due process. The trial court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing because the petition failed to meet the necessary prerequisites to file for such relief. The limitations period had expired almost eleven years before defendant filed his petition. In determining whether the grounds for relief arose after the limitations period normally would have commenced, the appellate court examined the narrative defendant relied upon in his petition. The narrative contained a dialogue between a police officer and defendant, which was necessarily known to defendant at the time it occurred as he was a participant in the dialogue. Therefore, defendant's ground for relief was not &quot;later-arising&quot; and did not require the tolling of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of the decision of the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted him of first-degree felony murder in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a)(2) and criminal attempt to commit especially aggravated robbery in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-403(a) and 39-12-101(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed after he was convicted and sentenced for first-degree felony murder and criminal attempt to commit especially aggravated robbery. The appellate court affirmed, stating that it disagreed with defendant's claim that he was too intoxicated or sleep-deprived to waive his Miranda rights. The appellate court was also unpersuaded by defendant's claim that he could not waive his Miranda rights due to his age and education level. The record did not support the claim that defendant was coerced by the police into giving the statement. Further, his argument that the police did not comply with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-115 was without merit since he failed to show that the period of time between when he was taken into custody and his delivery to the juvenile center was unreasonable. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, in part because the evidence indicated that defendant attempted to perpetrate a robbery that resulted in the victim's death. In part, defendant admitted that he brought a concealed weapon into the store and he said that he shot the victim after he tried to take possession of another juvenile's gun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was charged with parole violations as a result of violating certain drug court conditions. The Circuit Court for Dyer County (Tennessee) denied the defendant's motion for recusal, revoked the defendant's probation and reinstated the original six-year sentence with credit for time served during earlier probation revocations but not for time served as a sanction for violating the drug court program rules. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was previously sentenced to six years in prison for burglary and theft, but was released on probation with participation in a drug rehabilitation program. The defendant served six months in jail during the program for various violations of the drug program's requirements. The defendant was before the court for a revocation of his probation based on violating certain rules of the drug program. The trial judge refused to recuse himself because of his prior participation on the drug court team. The defendant claimed that his due process rights were violated because the judge presiding over his probation revocation had previously served as a member of his drug court team and had received ex parte information regarding the conduct at issue by virtue of his prior involvement. The appellate court agreed that the Due Process Clause required adjudication by a judge who had not previously reviewed the same or related subject matter as part of the defendant's drug court team. Although the issue of credit for time served was not raised on appeal, the appellate court questioned the constitutionality of not crediting the defendant with time served for drug court violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, an inmate convicted of robbery, rape, kidnapping, and two counts of crime against nature, appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, which dismissed his petition for a writ of error coram nobis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted by a jury in November of 1978. The instant court affirmed the convictions on February 27, 1980. Petitioner filed the petition for writ of error coram nobis that was the subject of this appeal on March 10, 2005. The parties did not dispute that the statute of limitations, if not tolled, expired many years before the filing of the instant petition. The instant court found that petitioner's delay in seeking coram nobis appeared, on its face, to be unreasonable under the circumstances of this case. The instant court also found that, in the interest of justice and in the event of further review, it would examine petitioner's claim on its merits. Next, the instant court found that petitioner had not met his burden of proving a Brady violation because he had not shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State suppressed the two medical reports at issue. The instant court reasoned in part that the prosecutor who prosecuted petitioner testified that he personally wrote a letter to the hospital requesting all the victim's medical records, and he identified a copy of that letter at the evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Coffee County (Tennessee) found defendant guilty of attempt to initiate of a process intended to result in the manufacture of methamphetamine in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-435, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant appealed asserting that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment as the language in &sect; 39-17-435 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that an ordinary person would not know what conduct was prohibited because &sect; 39-17-435 did not define the terms, &quot;any substance,&quot; &quot;active modification,&quot; or &quot;extraction.&quot; The court held, however, that those terms were commonly used words capable of being understood by a person of ordinary intelligence, and, although broad in a general sense, &sect; 39-17-435 required that they had to be done knowingly to result in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Further, &sect; 39-17-435 clearly stated that a person should not engage in one of the three delineated acts with knowledge that the acts would lead to the production of methamphetamine. Therefore, because the steps which comprised the initiation offense had to be undertaken &quot;knowingly,&quot; a person who inadvertently heated or mixed substances which were commonly used in the manufacture of methamphetamine would not be guilty of a crime under the terms of &sect; 39-17-435 unless the State proved that the conduct was undertaken with the intent to initiate a process that would lead to the production of methamphetamine. Accordingly, &sect; 39-17-435 clearly defined the prohibited conduct and was not susceptible to differing interpretations.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-215(a), 39-11-402(2), 39-13-401, and 39-13-403. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence showed that defendant recklessly killed the victim and facilitated the especially aggravated robbery committed by another individual. The forensics proved that the weapon provided by defendant, and later hidden by defendant, fired the bullet that struck the victim in the back of his head, resulting in his death. Additionally, the trial court's comments did not reflect on the weight or credibility of the evidence and the denial of full probation was appropriate. Defendant's credibility was not the only consideration in its denial of full probation. The court found that defendant's lack of potential for rehabilitation, the circumstances of the offense, and the risk of depreciating the seriousness of the offense outweighed his good social history and lack of criminal history.</SPAN></P>

She had been convicted in an earlier trial of especially aggravated robbery related to the same facts and victim. The appellate court affirmed, stating that there was no speedy trial violation under U.S. Const. amend. VI, Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, or Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-14-101 (2006). The appellate court was troubled by the prosecutor's inability to articulate a satisfactory explanation for the delay. However, defendant had the benefit of the previous sworn testimony of the key witnesses at her earlier trial and at a codefendant's trial. The appellate court balanced her claim of prejudice from witnesses' loss of memory against her failure to demand a speedy trial. The denial of her petition for writ of error coram nobis was proper because she failed to present her claim within one year of her conviction of especially aggravated robbery becoming final and she was not denied a reasonable opportunity to present her claim; due process did not require tolling of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was able to claim the privilege or elect to testify; he made a knowing decision to assert the privilege. He also failed to prove that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. The inmate failed to establish that had the jury had testimony relating to his &quot;chronic alcoholism,&quot; that the jury would not have found him guilty of premeditated murder. Additionally, two jurors were questioned as to their ability to disregard their personal experiences and to follow the law and the inmate offered no evidence to establish that the jury ultimately empaneled was biased or unfair. Thus, he failed to establish any prejudice by counsel's failure to more thoroughly question potential jurors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1981 a jury convicted the inmate and a codefendant of two counts of felony murder and imposed upon both men a sentence of death. After the denial of postconviction relief, the inmate appealed. However, the appellate court affirmed. The inmate's claims stemmed from allegations that the State wrongfully suppressed evidence. The inmate contended that the State improperly failed to disclose a supplementary offense report, but while that information was favorable to the inmate to some extent, it did not create a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed; thus, there was no Brady violation. Additionally, an anonymous tip was not material and an eyewitness's statement was not exculpatory. The eyewitness's statement did not contradict the multiple witnesses who identified the inmate as one of the robbers; rather it inculpated three other men in the robbery. In regard to his death sentence, the appellate court stated that Tennessee's capital sentencing scheme did not require aggravating factors to be pled in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petition because it was bound by the supreme court's decision on his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which found he was not entitled to relief because neither the face of the judgment nor the convicting court's record showed that it lacked jurisdiction. To establish the invalidity of his conviction, he would have had to produce proof outside the record, and a writ of habeas corpus could not issue under such circumstances.  Petitioner argued that the supreme court's decision violated the court's duty to interpret statutes according to their intent and purpose and amended the habeas corpus statutes. The court found it was without authority to reconsider the issues that were previously decided by the supreme court. While the convicting court's record established that petitioner committed his crimes on TVA property, it did not establish that the United States owned the land or that the convicting court lacked concurrent jurisdiction to punish petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in 1998 and did not reserve any question of law. In 2008, the State filed a Motion to Amend Judgment Order because the original judgment order failed to mandate lifetime community supervision as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-524, which applied to defendant because he was convicted of aggravated sexual battery under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-504. The corrected judgment order was entered on July 16, 2008. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on August 13, 2008. The court held that defendant could not appeal from the corrected judgment order under Tenn. R. App. P. 3. The original judgment order constituted an illegal sentence, which could be corrected at any time. Following entry of the corrected judgment order, defendant could have filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(f)(2), and he could have appealed the denial of the motion under Tenn. R. App. P. 3(b), or he could have challenged the guilty plea through a post-conviction proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate was convicted of two counts of first degree murder, one count of especially aggravated robbery and one count of aggravated rape. He was sentenced to death for each murder conviction. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. He subsequently petitioned for postconviction relief, which was denied by the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee. He challenged the denial of postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the inmate argued numerous violations of his constitutional rights, including denial of the effective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI. Initially, the inmate contended that trial counsel failed to seek suppression of statements the inmate made to the police over the telephone prior to his arrest. Affirming, the court noted that the physical evidence against the inmate was overwhelming. Given that evidence, in addition to the fact the inmate's trial testimony was similar in nature to the statements at issue, the court concluded the inmate failed to demonstrate prejudice. Defense counsel encouraged the jury during closing argument to find the inmate guilty of second degree murder instead of first degree murder. The court disagreed with the inmate's argument that this concession was a constructive denial of the assistance of counsel which required no proof of prejudice; there was no doubt about the physical evidence in the case. After reviewing each of the inmate's arguments, the court concluded that the inmate failed to establish that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel during either the guilt or penalty phase of his trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court merged the solicitation counts into the conspiracy count and entered a judgment for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the indictment sufficiently informed defendant of the charges against him so that he could prepare his defense and not be misled or surprised at trial. Further, the variance did not present a danger that defendant might be prosecuted a second time for the same offense. No constitutionally protected right existed to solicit murder, and as such, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-12-102 could punish actions that included speech made for the sole purpose of procuring activities that were illegal. Accordingly, U.S. Const. amend. I did not protect solicitation to commit first degree murder and the jury's guilty verdict was constitutional. The trial court also properly admitted evidence of defendant's discussions about express kidnappings because those discussions were integral parts of his solicitation of an inmate's assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee), which convicted her of theft of property valued at $ 10,000 or more but less than $ 60,000, a Class C felony, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-14-103 and 39-14-105(4) (2006). The trial court imposed a Range I, six-year sentence to be served on probation consecutive to a one-year sentence in another case and set the amount of restitution at $ 28,600.95.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed her theft conviction, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence showed that defendant made numerous purchases for her personal use with the business's funds. Defendant and the business owner were the only people who knew the administrator's password, and the owner testified that she did not make the entries that she attributed to defendant. The owner presented proof of losses to her business of $ 11,603.22. The owner and her accountant testified that defendant admitted making many of the purchases in question, including purchases with the gift cards. The jury assessed the credibility of the owner and accountant and accredited the State's proof. Her sentence was appropriate because defendant's actions were complex and the accountant's testimony and written summaries of the transactions were essential to the prosecution of the case. Therefore, accounting fees were a reasonable, necessary expense in the case. Further, the attorney fees incurred were a reasonable expense for a victim who had suffered a substantial loss as a result of criminal activity; thus, the trial court did not err in awarding restitution for the attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(f) to withdraw his guilty plea to attempted aggravated sexual battery following a correction of judgment to reflect that he was subject to community supervision for life pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-524 (2006). The Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) denied the motion. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was given erroneous advice by counsel or, in the alternative, because the trial court had not advised him of a direct consequence of his plea.

The court concluded that defendant was given neither erroneous advice, nor was he given no advice. Defendant was advised by counsel about the possibility of being subject to &sect; 39-13-524 and made an intelligent choice to plead guilty, hoping that it would not be imposed against him. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to tell him he might be subject &sect; 39-13-524 because his counsel did so. Defendant argued that the community supervision for life statute was unconstitutional. However, the issue was not raised in the trial court. Plain error review was not warranted as defendant failed to show that a clear and unequivocal rule of law had been breached or that a substantial right of his was adversely affected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which dismissed his petition for writ of habeas corpus in which he alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that he was subject to an illegal search, seizure and arrest, and that he received an unconstitutional enhancement of his sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had entered guilty pleas to numerous offenses and received an effective sentence of twenty-three years. He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, but the trial court denied relief, granting the motion to dismiss filed by the State on the basis that the inmate failed to raise a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the petition because none of the grounds for relief presented were cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding. The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should have been brought in a post-conviction proceeding, and even if treated as a post-conviction petition, it would have been untimely under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a). The inmate's claim that he was seized and searched illegally and that police officers violated his Miranda rights was waived by his guilty plea. The challenge to his sentence appeared to challenge the enhancement of his sentence, but because he entered a guilty plea, no enhancement factors were used to determine his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Despite defendant's claims that a witness's statements would subject her to criminal liability for facilitation of murder and accessory after the fact, her statements did not support criminal liability for either crime; the statements did not indicate that she knowingly furnished substantial assistance in commission of the felony under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-403(a), nor did they show that she intentionally misled the police to help the offenders under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-411. Thus, the statements were not admissible. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to sequester the jury in light of the trial court's admonitions to the jury to avoid media coverage of the trial and in light of the jurors' reporting that there were no major violations of the trial court's instructions. The imposition of consecutive sentences was appropriate under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b)(2) given defendant's criminal history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions for first-degree premeditated murder and abuse of a corpse, but the appellate court affirmed. Because the State established that the victim's body would have inevitably been discovered by one of the adjacent landowners, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress the bodily fluids obtained from the victim's body or the results of the subsequent DNA testing on those fluids. Defendant had no reasonable, legitimate expectation of privacy in the telephone calls he placed while incarcerated, and, therefore, the trial court did not err by denying his motion to suppress the recorded telephone conversations. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence a videotape of the crime scene, and any error in the trial court's ruling that defendant's prior convictions could be used for impeachment purposes was harmless. In addition, the prosecutor's statements during closing argument regarding the State's theory of the case, even if improper, did not rise to the level of plain error.</SPAN></P>

There was abundant evidence to show that defendant killed the victim with premeditation, including proof of his tumultuous relationship with the victim, his declared intent to kill her if she ever left him, the efforts he made to locate her after she left the state, his failure to seek any assistance for her at the time of her death, and the elaborate steps that defendant took to conceal the crime. The evidence was also sufficient to sustain defendant's especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder in the perpetration of a kidnapping convictions because sufficient circumstantial evidence established that defendant confined the victim in her vehicle against her will and that she died at some point during her confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee), which summarily dismissed his application for post-conviction relief as untimely. He argued that due process considerations tolled the one-year statute of limitations for post-conviction relief, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a) (2006), and entitled him to a delayed appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner pleaded guilty to attempted especially aggravated robbery. A jury found him guilty of felony murder. His convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. Petitioner contended that his counsel violated his due process rights by failing to appeal his case to the supreme court after his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, by failing to withdraw as counsel pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 14, and by failing to argue that petitioner was incompetent because of involuntary intoxication and failure to assert the defense of involuntary intoxication at trial. The court of criminal appeals held that the post-conviction court erred in dismissing the petition without conducting a hearing. Petitioner attached a letter from counsel as proof of counsel's intent to file for a Tenn. R. App. P. 11 appeal as well as a letter from the court clerk as proof of counsel's failure to properly withdraw from his case. Before dismissing the petition as untimely, the post-conviction court was required to conduct a hearing to determine if in fact, petitioner was misled to believe that counsel was continuing the appeals process, thereby requiring the tolling of the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On June 2, 2008, petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge of aggravated sexual battery, and the trial court entered judgment that day. The court held that the statute of limitations for post-conviction relief did not begin to run until July 2, 2008, thirty days later. Thus, petitioner had until July 2, 2009, to file his petition for post-conviction relief. Therefore, contrary to the post-conviction court's holding, the petition was timely filed under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a). Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-106(d), the petition alleged claims that, if taken as true, would entitle petitioner to relief, including allegations that petitioner took medications that affected his level of awareness of his surroundings, rendering his confession of guilt unreliable. He asserted that he signed a paper he did understand the contents of, believing that the paper was to drop the charges. He also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel did not call several witnesses, failed to preserve questions of law for appeal, and failed to timely file an appeal. Therefore, petitioner was entitled to appointment of counsel and a hearing pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 28, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-101 (2006). Petitioner contended that his sentence was illegal due to the trial court ordering him to serve his sentence at 100 percent and 35 percent for only one offense. The court held that the trial court's error in checking two boxes on the judgment form was a clerical error to be remedied by entry of corrected judgments pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 36. The record clearly indicated that the trial court intended for the sentence to be served at 100 percent; petitioner was convicted by a jury, and his status as a violent offender was an operation of statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501(i)(2)(E). An illegal sentence was a basis for habeas relief only if the illegality of the sentence was egregious to the point of voidness, and the indication of two sentencing ranges on the judgment form did not rise to this level of egregiousness.</SPAN></P>

Her trial counsel testified that he did not consider raising any constitutionality of the statute issue because be felt it was a weak argument and that the mother's extreme conduct alleged went beyond normal corporal punishment. He also testified that the mother appeared to understand her options and chose to plead guilty of her own volition. The court held that the constitutionality of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed from the Criminal Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, which denied his petition for postconviction relief. The inmate was previously found guilty of first degree murder and attempted second degree murder. For the capital conviction, the jury sentenced the inmate to death. The inmate presented eight claims, six of which addressed the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence presented at the postconviction evidentiary hearing revealed that counsel knew of or should have known of numerous contradicting identifications by witnesses to the shooting. By failing to cross-examine a police officer effectively as to his conflicting statements regarding his identification of the shooter, trial counsel left the jury with essentially unrebutted and untested testimony. Granting a new trial, the court stated that trial counsel's failure to use the prior statements of the officer, as well as the failure to use conflicting identifications of other witnesses, failed to subject the prosecution's case adequately to the adversarial process. Consistent with the court's conclusion that the inmate was prejudiced by counsel's failure to use and present information which would have attacked the credibility of the prosecution's eyewitness testimony and implicated another person at the guilt phase, the court determined that a reasonable probability existed that if counsel had introduced that same evidence as &quot;residual doubt&quot; evidence in the penalty phase, the outcome would have been different.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court denying postconviction relief and granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court excused a prospective juror because of her beliefs about the death penalty because her affirmation that she favored the death penalty in some circumstances, specifically where the victims were children, and her responses that she could follow the law and sign the verdict form if selected as a juror because she &quot;would have to&quot; made it clear that excusing her for cause was error. The court of criminal appeals disagreed. Despite some inconsistencies as to her ability to follow the law regarding the death penalty, the juror's overall responses indicated her unwillingness to judge others and to return a verdict of death. In excusing her for cause, the trial court observed and noted the juror's physical responses to questioning as well as the fact that she did not equivocate regarding her answers that she was unable to sign a death verdict. The trial court had sufficient reason to believe that the juror's views about the death penalty would &quot;prevent or substantially&quot; impair her performance as a juror. The trial court did not err in excusing the prospective juror.</SPAN></P>

The court of criminal appeals disagreed. Defendant used a deadly weapon, a gun, to kill the unarmed victim.

There was also evidence from more than one witness that immediately after the murder, defendant went to his car, retrieved a second gun, and threw the second gun into the woods behind his house. Defendant stated that he hid the second gun because he was under the impression that it was illegal to own such a gun. Defendant had the presence of mind to try to hide something he thought to be illegal presumably because he knew the police would come to his house to investigate his wife's death. That showed calmness immediately after shooting the victim. In addition, there was testimony that the nature of the gunshot wound to the victim's forehead lead to the conclusion that the gun was pressed tightly against the victim's head when it was fired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court for Smith County (Tennessee), which convicted him of reckless homicide in violation of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement, and in allowing the introduction of certain autopsy photographs. Upon review, the court found that defendant's previous Miranda wavier was still in effect when he made his statement as very little time had passed, he was questioned about exactly the same subject matter, and he was told several times throughout the day that he was not obligated to speak to law enforcement. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs under Tenn. R. Evid. 401, 402, and 403 because despite medical testimony describing the injuries, the photographs remained quite probative in their ability to give contest to the medical testimony. The court did find that defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated requiring merger of defendant's convictions. The evidence supporting defendant's convictions was identical, however, as it related to defendant's criminal conduct: both of his convictions rested on the same act, namely the impact he caused between the victim's head and the stairway wall in his residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated child abuse, merged defendant's reckless homicide conviction into his aggravated child abuse conviction, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to file a motion to suppress audio tapes. However, the appellate court would not second-guess a reasonably-based trial strategy made after adequate preparation for the case. Further, the inmate failed to show that a motion to suppress would have been granted or that there was a reasonable probability that the proceedings would have concluded differently had counsel performed the suggested task. The inmate claimed that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel because appellate counsel failed to object when the trial court did not declare a mistrial or strike a portion of the prosecutor's closing argument.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to four counts of theft of property over $ 60,000, a Class B felony, and three counts of theft of property over $ 10,000, a Class C felony. After a sentencing hearing, he received the following sentences: 9 years for theft of property over $ 60,000, 10 years for theft of property over $ 60,000, 3 years for each theft of property over $ 10,000, and 8 years for the two remaining theft of property over $ 60,000. The trial court ordered the 9, 10, and 3-year sentences to be served consecutively. It ordered the 8-year sentence to be served concurrently to the 10-year sentence, for an effective sentence of 22 years. The appellate court affirmed the sentences, stating that in regard to his theft of $ 148,000 from an estate, although the trial court erred by considering the amount taken because it amounted to double enhancement, nonetheless, the trial court properly found that two other enhancement factors supported the enhancement of the sentence. The record showed that defendant's theft from the estate involved more than one victim and that he abused a position of private trust as executor of the estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate sought judicial review of an order by the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) dismissing his petition for a writ of coram nobis. The trial court ruled the petition should be dismissed because it did not set out any newly discovered evidence and contained no exception to the one-year statute of limitations. The inmate argued that the dismissal was an unconstitutional denial of his right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had been convicted in 1984 and was serving a life sentence as a Range II offender following a conviction for aggravated rape. The inmate filed his petition for writ of error coram nobis outside the applicable statute of limitations. The State raised the time defense in its response to the petition. The inmate did not present any due process basis for tolling the statute of limitations, and he had not provided any explanation for the 20-year delay. The record was void of any reason beyond his control that prevented the timely filing of his coram nobis action. Further, the inmate acknowledged in his brief that no new evidence was alleged to exist on the face of his petition for relief. The inmate asserted that he received information pertinent to his case from the Innocence Project in 2005; therefore, he could have and should have included any claims based on that information in his petition filed in 2006. The trial court had not abused its discretion by refusing to allow an oral amendment to the petition on the day of the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1980, the inmate had been convicted of first-degree felony murder and he had received a sentence of death for his role in the victim's killing. The inmate currently appealed the denial of his motion to reopen his postconviction petition for the limited purpose of determining whether he was mentally retarded and, thus, ineligible for the death penalty. The appellate court affirmed the denial of relief, stating that it was unable to conclude that the issue of the inmate's IQ was litigated at his original trial. The State never sought further prosecution or punishment of the inmate and thus, he was not placed twice in jeopardy. The appellate court was unable to conclude that the inmate manifested subaverage general intellectual functioning prior to reaching the age of 18. The inmate also failed to establish that he had adaptive deficits by a preponderance of the evidence. He failed to meet the bright-line mark of 70 for establishing mental retardation at the time of the offense and thus failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was mentally retarded at the time of the offense under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-203(b) (2006).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Bledsoe County (Tennessee) to two counts of attempted aggravated sexual battery. He was sentenced to one year in prison and 11 years on probation. The trial court found that defendant had violated his probation by dating a woman who had children under the age of 18, ordered defendant returned to probation for 10 years, and required that he not have any contact with his fiance. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was alleged to have applied for a marriage license with a woman who had several children under age 18. Defendant argued that the probation condition that prohibited him from dating, befriending, residing or uniting with anyone with children under the age of 18 was not valid because it was not articulated to him by the trial court. However, he failed to provide a transcript of the guilty plea proceeding, so the court could not review this contention. He argued that this probation condition prohibiting him from having any contact, including telephone contact, with his fiancee was unconstitutional. The court noted that defendant failed to file a transcript of evidence or statement of the evidence as required by Tenn. R. App. P. 24(b). Without reviewing factual findings made by the trial court, it could not determine that the terms and conditions of probation (including no telephone contact with his fiance) were not reasonably related to the purpose of defendant's sentence and not unduly restrictive of the offender's liberty, as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-303(d)(9).</SPAN></P>

Defendant was 17 years old at the time of the crimes. A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, felony murder, and especially aggravated robbery; his murder convictions were merged. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentences, stating that the record did not preponderate against the trial court's findings that defendant was given his Miranda rights at all three interrogations before he made a statement and that he had the capacity to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive those rights. Further, the record did not preponderate against the court's finding that the police did not use coercive tactics and that defendant's statements were voluntarily given. According to the testimony of a sergeant, his unit members would not have talked to an unaccompanied juvenile other than to get a name and find out how to contact a parent. He confirmed that he did not talk to defendant about the case until his mother arrived.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which convicted him of first degree felony murder during the perpetration of aggravated child abuse and aggravated child abuse by infliction of injury, and which sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder and to a consecutive term of 22 years' incarceration for the aggravated child abuse conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the record was insufficient to support both his conviction for first degree felony murder based on aggravated child abuse and his conviction for aggravated child abuse, and that the trial court erred in admitting certain photographs of the victim's body. The court found that the record was devoid of any proof showing defendant inflicted physical injury upon the victim. The indictment on the aggravated child abuse count expressly provided that defendant did knowingly, other than by accidental means, treat the victim, a child six years of age or less in such a manner as to inflict injury. However, the State never argued that defendant inflicted the victim's fatal injuries and did not offer any proof in support of such theory. The evidence was sufficient to support the felony murder conviction as it showed that defendant knowingly failed to provide the victim with any medical assistance resulting in serious bodily injuries. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting autopsy photos as they were necessary to explain the medical testimony and their probative value outweighed any unfair prejudicial effect pursuant to Tenn. R. Evid. 401 and 403.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed however, stating that it agreed that the petition was untimely. The petition was required to have been filed within a year of the final action of the highest state appellate court to which an appeal was taken pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a). Regardless of any administrative alteration of the judgment within the Tennessee Offender Management Information System system, the inmate's application for permission to appeal was denied by the supreme court on April 23, 2007. Thus, the statute clearly mandated that any filing past April 23, 2008, was untimely. Further, the petition presented no argument that would have excused the late-filing of the petition. The inmate's grounds for relief addressed issues disposed of on direct appeal of his criminal case. The postconviction court did not err by failing to hold a hearing or appoint counsel; it had no jurisdiction to hear the petition, and it correctly ordered a summary dismissal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that the failure to extensively cross-examine the wife was a reasonably-based trial strategy in a case where the wife and the inmate had widely varying stories as to the facts and the two were the only eyewitnesses to the crime. The inmate was unable to show that counsel was either ineffective in his cross-examination or that he was prejudiced by the cross-examination. In addition, trial counsel's decision not to object to the Bin Laden comparison was a tactical decision made during the course of the proceedings and thus, trial counsel was not ineffective. Finally, the court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the sentencing law issue because there was no basis to raise it and the inmate did not prove that there was a reasonable probability that he would have been successful on the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which convicted him of five counts of statutory rape in violation of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that trial counsel erred in allowing the victim to testify regarding four instances of digital penetration and one instance of cunnilingus. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting such testimony because the victim did not contradict herself and that the victim understood the questions asked of her. In addition, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to his convictions. The court held that consent was a complete defense to assault under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-101 and that thus, because defendant digitally penetrated the victim with her consent, the assault convictions had to be vacated. The evidence, however, was sufficient to sustain the statutory rape convictions as the victim was 13 during the time period at issue, and the victim testified that defendant committed each of the charged acts. Finally, defendant challenged his sentence. The court determined that because the trial court's order of one year of day-for-day of confinement was far less that the possible 2.4 years, the sentence was authorized by Tennessee sentencing law, although that the sentence was to be served day-for-day was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for statutory rape, vacated his convictions for assault, affirmed his sentence length and split confinement, remanded and ordered the sentencing that judgment forms correctly reflected service of his period of confinement, and ordered that the day-for-day service requirement be deleted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate sought judicial review of the Criminal Court for Shelby County's (Tennessee) dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief as untimely and later attempt to vacate the order of dismissal. He argued that dismissal was in error because his petition was timely filed and that the post-conviction court did not have jurisdiction to vacate its order because the order had become final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate first argued that the post-conviction court erred in summarily dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief as untimely. The State agreed that the post-conviction court erred because the petition was filed within one year of the denial of his application for permission to appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The record established that the Tennessee Supreme Court denied the inmate's application for permission to appeal on June 18, 2007. He filed his petition for post-conviction relief on April 3, 2008. Thus, the inmate was clearly within the time frame for filing, and the post-conviction court erred in summarily dismissing his petition as outside the one-year statute of limitations. The State also agreed with the inmate that the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction to vacate its dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief. The post-conviction court's May 1, 2008, summary dismissal of the petition became final on May 31, 2008. Therefore, the post-conviction court was without jurisdiction to vacate its order of dismissal on November 13, 2008.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the post-conviction court was reversed, and the case was remanded to that court for proceedings in accordance with the Post-Conviction Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the habeas corpus statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-109, was an unconstitutional suspension of the writ and that the State was illegally depriving him of his inalienable right to his liberty by permitting slavery as punishment for crime. Upon review, the court held that notwithstanding any potential procedural waiver, as asserted by the State, dismissal for failing to state a cognizable ground for habeas relief was also correct. Although the consecutive or concurrent nature of his sentences was not entirely clear from the attachments submitted by the inmate, the inmate did not provide the court with sufficient documentation to substantiate his claim that his sentence was illegal or had expired. Most of the documentation provided by the inmate was in agreement that some consecutive service of his sentences was ordered. The court lacked sufficient information to determine the effective length of the inmate's sentences; regardless, it did not appear that any effective sentence would have expired. The inmate's confinement resulted from his commission of criminal acts and was not equivalent to slavery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to sentence him because: (1) in refusing to allow the jury to be informed of the punishment for first degree murder, the trial judge applied a procedure which was appropriate under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-35-101 to -505, but not under the first degree sentencing procedures, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-202 to -208, and thus, the trial judge created a third procedure or act which was not legislatively authorized; and (2) Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-208(c)&nbsp;unconstitutionally transferred the sentencing power to the executive branch. The court agreed with the habeas corpus court that the inmate merely submitted conclusory legal abstractions. The court found no need to become bogged down analyzing such abstractions. The inmate did not provide the court with any authority, and the court knew of none, that the two statutes could not work in conjunction with one another. Finally, the inmate's lawful sentence had not expired, and the sentencing court had jurisdiction and authority to enter the judgment against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted him of theft of property valued at over $ 1,000 in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-103, -105(3) (2003), felon in possession of a handgun, leaving the scene of an accident resulting in injury, and driving on a suspended license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient for the theft conviction, and that the trial court erred by providing the jury with an improper instruction on reasonable doubt and by finding that defendant's 2007 conviction for aggravated robbery was admissible for impeachment under Tenn. R. Evid. 609. The court found that although the victim's girlfriend had legal title to the vehicle that was stolen, she testified that the victim would borrow the vehicle from time to time because they bought the vehicle together, and that the victim borrowed her the vehicle on the night of the offense. Thereby the definition of owner under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-106(a)(26) was satisfied and the evidence was sufficient to support the theft of property conviction. Defendant was not entitled to relief regarding the jury instruction under plain error review because a clear and unequivocal rule of law was not breached. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the 2007 conviction because defendant in fact had nine convictions for aggravated robbery which were extremely relevant to his credibility, and the prejudicial effect was limited by admitting only one conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to charges of violating the sex offender registry statute due to failure to register a change of residence. Before the sentencing hearing, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the trial court denied. The trial court sentenced him to three years in the TDOC and he appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The transcript from the guilty plea hearing confirmed that the trial court thoroughly explained the nature of the charge defendant faced, the consequences of an open plea, and the rights defendant waived by pleading guilty. The trial court repeatedly asked defendant if he understood the guilty plea, to which he always answered affirmatively. Thus, there was no error in the refusal to all him to withdraw his guilty plea. In regard to his sentence, under T.C.A. &sect; 40-35-106(b)(4), the trial court properly considered the two felony convictions separately for sentencing purposes and properly found defendant a Range II multiple offender. Defendant's argument involving the further enhancement of his sentence was waived for failing to argue or cite authority in support of that argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the admission of his statement on the grounds that police violated the constitutional rights of his co-defendant, when they obtained the co-defendant's statement implicating defendant, and on the grounds that it was not voluntary. The court held that defendant lacked standing to assert the violation of his co-defendant's constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and U.S. Const. amend. V. Defendant's attempt to circumvent his lack of standing by framing his argument in terms of his own due process rights failed as there was no evidence to indicate that police used the co-defendant's statement in any way to violate defendant's due process rights. Defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 were not violated because defendant's confession was voluntary as he was aware of his rights and remained aware thereof throughout the continuous interrogation. Finally, under Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Tennessee Constitutions, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-12-103(c), the two conspiracy convictions should have be merged into a single conviction of conspiracy to commit especially aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court for Hamblen County (Tennessee), which convicted him of aggravated kidnapping in violation of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement, the aggravated kidnapping statute was unconstitutional, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and his sentence was excessive. The court found that the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's findings that defendant was fluent in both English and Spanish and that defendant voluntarily executed both a consent to search and a Miranda waiver. Thus, the motion to suppress was properly denied. The court also found no constitutional requirement that defendant be separately charged and convicted of an underlying felony in order to hold sufficient evidence supporting the primary felony and thus, the indictment was not based upon an unconstitutional statute. The victim testified that defendant grabbed her, forced her into his car, prevented her from escaping, pushed her down onto a bed, and forced her to have sex. Such evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Finally, the record reflected that the trial court followed the applicable sentencing principles and appropriately found the existence of applicable enhancement factors and mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants sought review of the decision of the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted them of aggravated robbery in violation of T.C.A. &sect; 39-13-402(a)(1). They were both sentenced as a Range II, multiple offender, to 18 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendants were convicted of aggravated robbery; the appellate court affirmed. The first defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment against him on the basis of prosecutorial vindictiveness. He contended that his re-indictment on the greater charge of aggravated robbery after he decided not to accept the State's offer of settlement based on a charge of facilitation of aggravated robbery created a presumption of vindictiveness. However, he failed to point to any vindictiveness. The newly assigned prosecutor decided that the circumstances supported an indictment of aggravated robbery under a theory of criminal responsibility. The trial court did not err in allowing a weapon found in the apartment of defendant's roommate to have been introduced into evidence. The victim testified that an AK-47 rifle was used during the offense and an AK-47 rifle was found in the first defendant's apartment after the robbery. The evidence was relevant and any discrepancy between the victim's description at trial of the weapon used during the robbery and the actual weapon recovered went to the weight the jury might have chosen to assign the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the inmate failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not present potential witnesses that counsel did not locate at the post-conviction hearing. Further, the inmate failed to show that had counsel located the witnesses he would have insisted on going to trial. In addition, the inmate failed to show that his plea was not voluntary or intelligent as the inmate was made aware of the consequences of pleading guilty, the inmate understood the plea agreement, and the inmate understood his rights and the sentence he would receive. Further, the inmate waived the issue pertaining to the constitutionality of the statute as it was not addressed with the post-conviction court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Van Buren County, Tennessee, that convicted him of the promotion of methamphetamine manufacture, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because his detention exceeded the constitutionally lawful period for a detention under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and that his consent to search was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped for not wearing a seat belt in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-9-603(a)(2) (2006). Although defendant refused to consent to a search of his vehicle, he subsequently gave consent to a second deputy who arrived on the scene, and a search uncovered illegal drugs. On review, the court held that the deputy detained defendant and his passengers based solely on their nervous behavior and his knowledge of their past criminal involvement with methamphetamine. This was constitutionally insufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion to extend the detention. Further, where the deputy admitted that he generally issued a traffic citation within 10 minutes of stopping a vehicle but had not begun to write a citation related to this stop and asked for consent to search 15 minutes after making the traffic stop, the length of the detention exceeded that allowed under the cite and release statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-7-118 and 55-10-207. Because the detention was excessive and illegal and because the consent to search was not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal detention, defendant's consent was not voluntary, and his motion to suppress should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Smith County, Tennessee, that convicted him of three counts of vehicular homicide by recklessness and three counts of reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-213(b)(1) and 39-13-103(b), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant because it showed that defendant, while under the influence of cocaine, chased after the victims' vehicle and, at four separate times, hit it hard enough to cause debris to fall into the road, with the final impact occurring immediately before the crash site. At that time, the victims' car had been moving fast enough that the left edges of both driver's side tires left markings on the road as the car skidded to the right and into to a ditch. Those facts permitted a rational jury to disbelieve defendant's account of a low-speed chase featuring slight accidental contact and to believe that defendant hit the victims' car having consciously disregarded any danger of death or serious injury. However, the trial court erred in finding the consecutive sentencing statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115, unconstitutional and imposing consecutive sentences under its inherent powers; Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b) required certain findings to be made before imposing consecutive sentences. Finally, the failure to merge each pair of convictions violated double jeopardy because they arose from the same criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, but the case was remanded for reconsideration of the consecutive sentences and for entry of judgment forms properly reflecting merger of the reckless endangerment convictions into the vehicular homicide convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the record supported the imposition of consecutive sentences for defendant's convictions of vehicular homicide by intoxication and vehicular assault by intoxication on the basis that defendant was a dangerous offender because the record showed that defendant developed a drinking problem as early as two years before the accident and, throughout this time, friends and family members tried to convince defendant to enter a treatment facility to address his drinking issues; that defendant refused to treat his alcohol dependence; that, six months prior to the accident at issue, defendant was convicted of driving drunk in Texas but that this did not curb defendant's drinking; and that, on the day at issue, defendant consumed a significant amount of alcohol before beginning his drive home to pick up his children, swerved into the opposite lane, and struck the victims' vehicle, killing one victim and severely injuring the other. By rejecting intervention efforts, continuing to drink after his Texas D.U.I. conviction, and, ultimately, drunkenly making his way home to pick up his children, defendant created a situation where the risk to human life was high.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of the Madison County Circuit Court, Tennessee, which dismissed his petition for writ of habeas corpus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State asserted that petitioner did not comply with the procedural requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-107 because the affidavit attached to the petition was not notarized, petitioner failed to state that the legality of his confinement had not already been adjudged, and the petition was not filed in the appropriate county. Moreover, the State argued that the collection of petitioner's DNA has previously been adjudicated on direct appeal or in prior habeas actions and should not be relitigated. The instant court concluded that petitioner was not entitled to habeas corpus relief. Petitioner offered as an affidavit a document that was not notarized. As such, it was insufficient to satisfy the affidavit requirement of the habeas corpus statute. The habeas court's summary dismissal of the petition was proper because the petition failed to comply with the procedural requirements of habeas corpus relief. Next, though not entirely clear from petitioner's brief, to the extent that he argued the collection of his DNA was improper or unconstitutional, the instant court concluded that this issue had been previously adjudicated, and therefore without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, that denied his petition for post-conviction relief following his convictions for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated burglary, arguing that counsel was ineffective in failing to make inquiry into his mental impairments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that, where petitioner's I.Q. was determined to be 70 when he was 13, 73 when he was 19, and 75 when he was 28, the post-conviction court did not err in finding that petitioner failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was mentally retarded, as the legislature intended for a score of 70 to be the bright-line cutoff and did not take into account standard rates of error. However, petitioner's attorneys were ineffective in failing to investigate petitioner's mental impairment where they were aware that he had some type of mental impairment; because petitioner was charged with first-degree murder and the State was seeking a capital sentence, the failure to investigate prevented counsel from discovering that petitioner had an I.Q. test when he was 13 years old that revealed him to have an I.Q. of 70, which was the threshold delineating mental retardation and ineligibility for the death penalty under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-203. Even if the trial court would have found that petitioner was not mentally retarded, defense counsel could nevertheless have presented this evidence to the to show mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentence of death was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new sentencing hearing, but the judge who presided over the post-conviction proceeding was disqualified from any subsequent proceedings. With regard to the guilt phase of the trial, the judgment of the post-conviction court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2008, petitioner filed petitions for post-conviction relief and for habeas corpus relief from 1989 guilty-pleaded convictions of two counts of aggravated rape. Petitioner claimed he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and that his persistent offender sentence was illegal. Petitioner acknowledged that his petition for post-conviction relief had been filed outside the applicable three-year statute of limitations. However, his bare allegation that due process principles required the tolling of the statute of limitations was insufficient to trigger further inquiry. Petitioner's claim that the trial court enhanced his sentence in violation of Blakely did not avail him habeas corpus relief, because he was sentenced 15 years before the decision. His claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial and that his guilty pleas were unknowingly and involuntarily entered did not present cognizable grounds for habeas corpus relief. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee upheld the trial court's decision denying the petitions without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Armed with numerous weapons and ammunition, defendant drove to his estranged wife's workplace, shot his wife in the leg to &quot;get her attention,&quot; shot her three more times after she fell to the floor, and shot three other victims before leaving and returning with additional fire power and firing numerous additional shots into his wife's lifeless body. On review, the court held that aggravating factor under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5) was proper because the wife's murder was atrocious and cruel. The wounds to the victim's head inflicted in the initial shooting were fatal; as such, the additional wounds inflicted were beyond that necessary to cause death. The Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(12) mass murder aggravating factor was also proper because defendant killed three people during the shooting. In conducting its proportionality and reasonableness review under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-206, the court found the death penalty to be reasonable; the death penalty had been upheld in numerous cases where the victim was the defendant's wife or girlfriend, in cases in which the defendant committed mass murder, and in which the defendant had little or no prior criminal history.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee upheld the decision. The trial court, by virtue of a valid indictment issued after the arrest and detention, was vested with subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate petitioner's guilt. The claims raised by petitioner has been previously determined and could not be re-litigated in a habeas petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dyer County, Tennessee, that convicted him of selling cocaine within a drug-free school zone under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-417(a)(3), arguing that the Drug-Free School Zone Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432 (2005), was unconstitutional because it violated due process and arguing that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of facilitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the Drug-Free School Zone Act was not overbroad or vague and did not violate the principles of due process. Although the language of the 2005 amendment was poorly worded, the act's subsections were not contradictory or vague. Because defendant sold cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, he was subject to an enhanced penalty. Further, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on facilitation as a lesser-included offense of selling cocaine. The evidence did not support a jury instruction on facilitation under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-403(a) as a lesser-included offense because the evidence established that a confidential informant telephoned defendant, that she told the person who answered that she wanted to buy cocaine, and that defendant arrived at the informant's location and sold cocaine to her. Although the defense theorized that defendant merely delivered the drugs for the person who answered the phone, the evidence, not the theories of the parties, controlled whether an instruction was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that his counsel was ineffective and his plea was not voluntary. Respondent State of Tennessee argued that the petition was untimely as it exceeded the one-year statute of limitations under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(b). In reply, the inmate asserted post-conviction court erred in dismissing his petition as untimely because the statute of limitations for filing was tolled by the unconstitutional failure of another county's circuit court to treat his petition for habeas corpus relief, as one for post-conviction relief. The court found that the inmate's habeas corpus petition was filed in the other county, where he was imprisoned, and such was not the county where he was originally convicted as required under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-104(a). The other county's circuit court had no jurisdiction to hear the inmate's post-conviction claims because it did not enter the judgment of conviction, and it had no authority to transfer the case to the conviction county. During the entire litigation of his habeas corpus claim, the inmate never argued that his non-cognizable claims should be treated as post-conviction claims for purposes of Tenn.

The appellate court reversed and dismissed the indictment, stating that the trooper lacked reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop. The taillight was broken, but an attempt to repair the light had been made by defendant. Applying those facts to the taillight statute,&nbsp;Tennessee Code Annotated section 55-9-402, the officer did not have probable cause to believe the taillight was not in &quot;good condition.&quot; The taillight on the vehicle driven by defendant was not in perfect condition nor was it in pristine condition. Rather, it was in working condition. The trooper testified that the taillight was operational and was not a safety issue to anyone on the night that he stopped the defendant. Having a light covered largely in red tape was not the optimum situation, but defendant did make an attempt to maintain his vehicle in proper working order.</SPAN></P>

The State asserted that the statute of limitations for filing a petition for post-conviction relief had expired and argued that due process did not require tolling of the limitations period. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee agreed. Petitioner did not have any specific documented evidence to substantiate his claims, and he failed to convince the court that he was actually innocent; therefore, due process was not implicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, that convicted her of first-degree premeditated murder and first-degree felony murder under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202 (2003) and especially aggravated robbery under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-403 (2003), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of first-degree premeditated murder because defendant carried a handgun in her purse when she arrived at the victim's house and, once inside the victim's bedroom, pulled the gun from her purse and shot the victim. While defendant argued self-defense, there was no evidence that the victim was armed; no other weapon was found in the victim's bedroom and the victim's fingers were locked beneath his head when he was found by police. Further, defendant admitted to police that the victim did not try to force himself on her and did not threaten her with a gun at any point. The evidence also supported felony murder and aggravated robbery convictions because defendant killed the victim before taking his guns, which she intended to pawn, and cash. While defendant robbed the victim after killing him, the sequence of events did not foreclose a felony murder conviction because defendant took the victim's guns and money immediately after she killed him; this established a sufficient connection of time, place, and continuity of action to show that the killing occurred in perpetration of the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for especially aggravated robbery was reversed, and the case was remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction for aggravated robbery, the offense with which defendant was charged, and for imposition of a sentence on that offense. In all other respects, the judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) of two counts of robbery, two counts of aggravated robbery, and one count of intentionally evading arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his statement to law enforcement was not voluntary. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence showed that before giving his statement, defendant was advised of his rights twice, and twice indicated he understood those rights. The evidence also showed that defendant was not threatened or coerced, and that at the time that he gave a statement, defendant did not appear to be under the influence of crack cocaine. Additionally, defendant testified that he had attended three years of college and had experience with the judicial system. Defendant stated that at the time of the interview, he understood that he did not have to give a statement to the police and could have an attorney present. The trial court's findings that defendant was read and understood his Miranda rights, voluntarily signed a waiver of those rights, was not threatened, and was not under the influence of any intoxicant at the time he gave a statement were supported by the record and were presumed correct. Therefore, the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Lauderdale County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for habeas corpus relief. The State filed a motion requesting that the court affirmed the lower court's denial of relief pursuant to Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the prosecutor's argument and the trial court's jury charge essentially amended the indictment resulting in a void conviction, that his convictions were void because he was sentenced in violation of Blakely v. Washington, and that he received the ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel and that the trial court erred in permitting introduction of evidence of a prior bad act. The court noted that allegations about the prosecutor's argument, about a Blakely violation, and about counsel would merely render the judgment voidable, not void and thus the inmate was not entitled to relief. The inmate also claimed that the indictment charging him with over.5 grams of cocaine with intent failed to provide him adequate notice of the charged offense. The indictment was sufficient under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-13-202, as it informed the inmate of the essential elements of the charged offenses; named the inmate as the accused, the date of the offense, the actus reus, the mens rea, and referenced to the application statute; and vested jurisdiction in the convicting court and placed the inmate on notice of the nature of the charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed the trial court's grant of a motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of a warrantless arrest and subsequent search of defendant. The appellate court concluded that the police officers had probable cause to arrest and search defendant. Accordingly, the appellate court reversed and remanded the judgment. While conducting surveillance of a suspected drug dealer, the officer observed defendant give money to the suspected drug dealer in exchange for a small plastic bag. Given his law enforcement experience, the officer interpreted the exchange as an illegal drug transaction and relayed his observations to other police officers. Based on the officer's firsthand observations, defendant was ultimately arrested and told by police while in custody that he was going to be searched. The officer's observations satisfied the probable cause standard for a warrantless arrest; accordingly, the eventual search after defendant's arrest was constitutionally sound as a search incident to a lawful arrest under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 7 of the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that, although appointed counsel did not meet the American Bar Association (ABA) standards for capital representation, those guidelines were not binding upon Tennessee, and there was no authority that the ABA's qualifications for capital counsel or the required qualifications for capital counsel in Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 13 were constitutionally compelled. The Fourteenth Amendment guidelines simply required the appointment of an attorney to a capital defendant; that counsel failed to meet the heightened requirements of Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 13 did not render her representation per se ineffective. Further, counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction on the defense of ignorance or mistake of fact under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-502 (2003) and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-203 (2003). Although defendant claimed that he did not intend to kill the victim because he shot at his legs, the facts established that defendant chased the victim underneath a vehicle and then fired multiple rounds at the victim's legs; when defendant employed a deadly weapon against another in a deadly manner, it could only be concluded that he intended a deadly result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Lawrence County, Tennessee, that convicted her of theft of property valued over $60,000 in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-103 and imposed a 10-year term of imprisonment, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction and that the trial court erred in imposing an excessive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant worked at a hospital until it was discovered that she was embezzling money. On review of her conviction, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the State not only proved her guilt through the use of her confession but also through the use of records and bank statements that defendant embezzled over $174,000 by altering checks originally made payable to insurance companies by making herself the payee and by stealing cash from the hospital's bank deposits. The State proved defendant's theft by comparing the carbon copies of checks as they first appeared with the altered checks listing defendant as the payee at the time they were presented at the bank and then systematically showed that defendant endorsed these checks and then contemporaneously cashed or deposited them into her joint bank account shared by her husband; the State also showed contemporaneous deposits of cash that corresponded to the cash missing from the hospital's bank deposits. However, the trial court committed a Blakely violation by applying enhancement factors that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was modified by reducing it to the presumptive sentence of eight years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his felony murder and premeditated murder convictions. The court of criminal appeals disagreed. Defendant went to the victim's home seeking money in order to obtain drugs. When he was unable to obtain money, he raped the victim. Evidence of the rape included defendant's semen, identified by DNA correlation, on bed and bath linens from the victim's home. In order to keep the victim from reporting that he had raped her and stolen from her, he killed the victim by strangling her with an electrical cord. According to the State's proof, death by strangulation would take minutes, even if pressure were firm and constant. Defendant admitted, as well, that he took money from the victim. The proof demonstrated that defendant committed a willful, deliberate, malicious and premeditated killing of the victim. Additionally, defendant committed a killing in the perpetration of both a rape and a larceny. The DNA proof was thoroughly presented and tested at the trial. The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the evidence and the witnesses with respect to the DNA evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the inmate had failed to state a claim for relief which was cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding and summarily dismissed the habeas corpus petition. The appellate court determined that the inmate's argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and his challenge to the jury selection process had been previously determined in his direct appeal and on postconviction review. Also, the inmate's assertion that his conviction was the result of mistaken identification, even if true, would not render the judgment of conviction void, but merely voidable.

The appellate court affirmed however, stating that it rejected his challenge to the constitutionality and imposition of consecutive sentencing, as both issues were raised and decided on direct appeal. Thus, they were previously determined under T.C.A. &sect; 40-30-106(f) (2006). The inmate urged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the trial court and the district attorney general recuse themselves because the victim was the daughter of a county commissioner. However, the inmate failed to support that bare allegation. There was no evidence presented that the victim's mother had any inappropriate contact with, or undue influence on, either the trial court or the district attorney general's office which would have rendered them impartial in any way.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of premeditated first-degree murder, attempted premeditated first-degree murder, and aggravated arson where the evidence showed that (1) defendant began drinking heavily; (2) defendant became angered with his ex-wife, with whom he lived, when she refused to give him money to buy more beer; (3) defendant brandished a knife and ordered his ex-wife and the victim, an elderly man who shared a mobile home with defendant and defendant's ex-wife, to the front of the trailer and threatened to slit the victim's throat; (4) defendant grabbed his ex-wife when she tried to break away to call for help, pushed her down, and put the knife to her throat; (5) defendant retrieved duct tape and bound his ex-wife and the victim to prevent their escape while continuously telling them that they were going to die that night; (6) defendant retrieved a jug of kerosene that he poured throughout the trailer, slashing some on the victim and his ex-wife; (7) defendant unplugged all fire alarms and released his ex-wife's dog; and (8) defendant twisted a newspaper, ignited it, placed it next to the stove, and left.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 616 because it was not relevant to any issue at trial. The trial court did not err by admitting a tape recording of the victim's 911 call as an excited utterance under Tenn. R. Evid. 803(2) because: (1) defendant conceded that the sexual battery was a startling event and that the victim's statement related to it; (2) the victim was 18 years old and had recently experienced a sexual assault; and (3) throughout the recording, the victim cried and experienced difficulty in speaking with the operator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee, that convicted him of felony murder under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for an acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find defendant guilty. The evidence showed that defendant took the five-year-old victim and his siblings to a cemetery and separated them, that defendant took the victim elsewhere and the other two children could hear him screaming, that one of the children found defendant with the victim and the victim's pants were pulled down, and that the victim was later taken to the hospital where extensive injuries to his genitals and his anus were discovered. The child's siblings further testified that, after the group returned home following the rape, defendant stomped, kicked, and threw the victim, severely beating him, and the doctor who treated the child at the hospital testified that the child's injuries were extensive, required extreme force, and were consistent with being punched or stomped on by another person. The medical examiner testified that the victim died as a result of blunt head and abdominal trauma, and defendant admitted to the police that he repeatedly slammed the child against the wall because he was angry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of judgments from the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Tennessee), which convicted him of and sentenced him for three counts of aggravated rape, especially aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and theft greater than $ 500 but less than $ 1000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because the victim's identification of him was untrustworthy, and there was not fingerprint or DNA evidence. In addition, defendant argued that the sentences were excessive. On appeal, the court found that the victim testified that she was able to get a clear look at defendant while he was attacking her. Futhermore, her car was discovered at a school minutes after defendant arrived at the school. Additionally, a wet bandana used to cover her eyes during the attacks and items taken from her home were found under defendant's bed. Despite the lack of fingerprint or DNA evidence, the court held that sufficient proof was presented at trial for a rational jury to conclude that defendant committed the crimes. With regard to the sentencing, the State conceded and the court agreed that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factors under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114 that were neither admitted by defendant nor determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This error resulted in a need for modification with regard to defendant's sentence for the aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, affirmed his sentences for the aggravated rapes, especially aggravated kidnapping, and theft, affirmed the order of consecutive sentencing, and modified defendant's sentences for aggravated robbery to eight years and for aggravated burglary to three years.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that because there was no direct appeal of his convictions, defendant had one year from October 26, 2002, the date his judgments of conviction became final, to file his post-conviction claim. The present petition was filed over three and one-half years beyond that time. The evidence which defendant claimed was newly discovered was not of the type that was subject to the tolling provision. The Post-Conviction Procedure Act provided a one-year statute of limitations, and among those exceptions there was no provision for newly discovered evidence claims other than new scientific evidence, &sect; 40-30-102(a), (b)(1)-(3). It was not appropriate for the appellate court to consider the allegations of the petition relative to coram nobis relief. Defendant's claims had not been heard on the merits, Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-30-106(h) (2006), but the petition was untimely. Defendant's other issues were waived.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court dismissed the indictments based upon its determination that Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-433(a)(1) did not apply to the purchase of an immediate methamphetamine precursor due to the existence of Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-433(a)(2), which applied to the purchase of more than nine grams of immediate methamphetamine precursor. The trial court also determined that the State could not be allowed to amend the indictments to charge under subsection (a)(2) because the State could not prove that defendants purchased more than nine grams of immediate methamphetamine precursor in one purchase. Subsection (a)(1) applied to the purchase of nine grams or less of immediate methamphetamine precursor because the legislature did not intend to restrict punishment to those who purchased more than nine grams of precursor and absolve those who purchased nine grams or less of precursor with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was indicted for two counts of aggravated robbery and two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping. Even though petitioner was a minor at the time the crimes were committed, he was tried as an adult based on a finding of a past and unrelated delinquent act of aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to sixty-six years in prison. In post-conviction proceedings, the trial court dismissed his petition without a hearing because it was time-barred. On appeal, petitioner argued due process tolling of the statute of limitations based on claims that: (1) the issue of his trial as an adult was never appealed; (2) relevant alibi witnesses were not called; and (3) the photographic spread was unduly suggestive. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee held that due process was not implicated because petitioner did have a reasonable opportunity to have his claims heard. By failing to raise his claims on direct appeal, petitioner waived his right to review under T.C.A. &sect; 40-30-106(g), (h) (2006).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his premeditated murder conviction because the proof at trial showed that he did not intentionally kill the victim, but rather, he killed the victim in self-defense or under strong provocation due to the victim's unwelcome sexual advances toward him. The court of appeals disagreed. The proof established that defendant was upset because the victim made unwanted sexual advances toward him. The proof also established that defendant decided he wanted to rob the victim. At some point in the evening, defendant pretended to fall asleep and the victim went to his bedroom and fell asleep. Defendant took the victim's gun, woke the victim up, demanded money from him, and shot him multiple times in the face and head. The evidence further showed that defendant called his girlfriend from the victim's cell phone and bragged about his intent to kill the victim. Accordingly, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant exercised reflection and judgment prior to killing the victim, and thus, the killing was intentional and premeditated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury of the Sevier County Circuit Court (Tennessee) convicted defendant of violating Tennessee's former Sexual Offender Registration and Monitoring Act, and the trial court sentenced him to eleven months, twenty-nine days to be served as one hundred eighty days in confinement and the remainder on supervised probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that, at the time he was charged with violating the Act, the Act violated due process. The court agreed with the State that the Act did not violate due process by criminalizing behavior outside a registrant's control because former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-39-104 (repealed 2004) did not require the registrant to mail the monitoring form. It required that a registrant &quot;cause such form to be delivered&quot; to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). Registrants could use any medium necessary to return the form as long as the form was delivered to the TBI no more than 10 days after the registrant received it. The trial court concluded that the Act was clear in that it required defendant actually to deliver the monitoring form to the TBI within 10 days. Defendant did not contest that ruling on appeal, and the court found no merit to his due process argument. A TBI records custodian testified in person about defendant's violation. Defendant did not explain how the Act had a discriminatory effect on him. Moreover, the Act did not violate equal protection, as it applied equally to all registrants. Defendant failed to allege discriminatory selective enforcement in his case.</SPAN></P>

The inmate did not present any proof at the postconviction hearing to prove that the violation of Tennessee Code Annotated section 55-9-404(a) was the sole reason for the stop.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that because the Tennessee drug tax under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2801 was not a criminal punishment for purposes of the double jeopardy clause under U.S. Const. amend. V and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, defendant's prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to sell or deliver would not impose a second punishment for the same act. The drug tax was not a criminal punishment because: (1) the drug tax on its face revealed a clear legislative intent for the act to be a civil remedy; (2) taxes had not been historically regarded as punishment; (3) the imposition of the drug tax did not require a finding that the dealer had a particular mental state; (4) Tennessee's tax rate was not so high as to impose a criminal punishment; (5) although the tax was conditioned upon the commission of a crime, it was not restricted to persons who had been arrested as it contained provisions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-4-2805(a) by which a dealer could pay the tax voluntarily and anonymously; and (6) the tax expressly stated in Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the length of the probationary term was excessive. The court of appeals agreed. There was nothing in the record to support a finding that sixteen years of probation was the least severe measure necessary to achieve the purposes for which the sentence was imposed. The record reflected that defendant had discontinued the use of alcohol and drugs, regularly attended AA meetings, had a strong support system, had talked with others about drinking and driving, and had expressed her desire to continue to be a positive influence in keeping intoxicated drivers off the road. Defendant had no prior criminal record and was gainfully employed. The trial court ordered a year of confinement in addition to the maximum probationary term. The probation component of defendant's sentence should have been set at eight years. Therefore, the length of defendant's probationary term was improper. In addition, the trial court properly suspended defendant's driving privileges for eight years, although improperly terming it a &quot;revocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Bedford County (Tennessee) of five counts of selling.5 grams or more of cocaine and was sentenced to 24 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court committed reversible error in consolidating the charge for the April 11 offense with the other four. The court of appeals agreed as to the April 11 conviction. The agent followed a confidential informant to a trailer park but did not see where she went inside the park and did not see her in the presence of defendant. Although the State placed into evidence the audio recordings of the informant's April 11 telephone call to defendant and her transactional meeting with him, the State relied upon the informant's testimony to identify defendant's voice on the tapes. Defendant testified that he not only sold no drugs to the informant but also that he never resided in the trailer park. Although the evidence of defendant's guilt of the offense was sufficient, it was not overwhelming, nor did it rise to the same level as that presented for the other offenses. The weaker nature of the proof of the offense lead to a conclusion that the jury's verdict was most likely unfairly influenced by proof of the other offenses. Therefore, the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary and three counts of aggravated rape after a jury trial. The Criminal Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee, sentenced defendant to thirty-eight years for each count of aggravated rape, to be served concurrently, and to ten years for aggravated burglary, to be served consecutively, for a total effective sentence of forty-eight years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was fifteen years old. She was inside the residence she shared with her mother. Defendant and his accomplice kicked in the back door. The sexually penetrated the victim. The victim saw defendant's face in her bedroom mirror while the rape took place. He used a deadly weapon to commit the rape. After taking some valuables, they left the house. Blood was discovered on the victim's socks and in the carpet. DNA found in each blood sample matched that of defendant. He admitted on the witness stand and through his plea of guilty to aggravated burglary, that he entered the victim's house without the effective consent of the owner. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee held that the evidence was more than sufficient to support defendant's convictions for aggravated burglary and three counts of aggravated rape. The trial court's application of enhancement factors to the defendant's sentence did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights. Additional issues raised by defendant were waived because his appellate brief was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of 50 years. Petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the trial court erred in enhancing his sentence and ordering his sentences to run consecutively. The trial court dismissed the application. On appeal, the court found that petitioner's claims were grounded in the fact that the sentencing scheme upon which he was sentenced had since been found to be unconstitutional.

The indictments set forth both the elements of the offense and the statute which defined the offense. Therefore, the indictments were sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the convicting court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After entering guilty pleas, appellant petitioner received a sentence of 17 years to be served at 100 percent for especially aggravated kidnapping and a sentence of 2 years to be served at 30 percent for escape, the sentences to be served consecutively. The Circuit Court for Morgan County, Tennessee, denied the petitioner's pro se petition for habeas corpus relief. The petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the petitioner contended the habeas corpus court erred by dismissing the petition without a full evidentiary hearing. The appellate court disagreed, finding that although the petitioner complained that he was erroneously ordered to serve 100 percent of his 17-year sentence, he failed to allege that his sentence was imposed in direct contravention of any statute. The 100 percent release eligibility date was required by operation of law under T.C.A. &sect; 40-35-501(i)(2)(C) (1997), and was not, therefore, illegal. Similarly, the petitioner's claim that the consecutive sentencing was improper did not avail him of habeas corpus relief. The petitioner's claim, even if true, would have rendered the judgments voidable rather than void, and was not, therefore, a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. Moreover, the petitioner was sentenced three years before the decision in Blakely; his case was a separate collateral attack and was not in the pipeline.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court's conclusion that the evidence would not have altered the verdict was reasonable because there were variances between the details of the alleged confessor's statements to the death row inmates and the evidence introduced. In regard to the first inmate's petition for postconviction relief, he failed to show that his counsel was ineffective in respect to the identification of defense witnesses. In regard to the second inmate, his contention that counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate an alleged alibi defense was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Circuit Court for Bedford County (Tennessee) convicted petitioner inmate of 17 crimes involving his sexual contact with three minor girls. Those convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The post-conviction court denied the petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Counsel did not specifically confront one of the victims with inconsistent statements concerning where she alleged the inmate touched her and concerning what she wore during the incident. Also, counsel's decision to refrain from harsh line-by-line cross-examination was within the discretion of defense counsel, particularly because of the age of the victims. However, counsel skillfully cross-examined two of the victims using their pre-trial statements. In addition, counsel met with the inmate a number of times, spoke with potential witnesses, and proceeded to trial based on the inmate's defense that he was innocent. Thus, counsel was adequately prepared for the trial. In addition, because the State and the victim presented no evidence at trial concerning the victim's sexual behavior, the credibility exception to Rule 412 did not apply, and a Rule 412 motion would not have been successful. Finally, the inmate's prior bad check convictions were properly admitted into evidence under Rule 609 for the purpose of impeachment. Thus, the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claims failed. Therefore, the post-conviction court properly denied his petition for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the post-conviction court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted for sexually assaulting the victim, a child, and later touching a second victim's right buttock. On appeal, the court held that the inmate was not denied his right to a fair trial on the ground that the trial court used the Coley case to exclude a defense expert's testimony that, concerning the reliability of eyewitness identification, certain leading questions could elicit certain answers, even though the Coley case was overruled by the Copeland case after the inmate filed his petition but before the hearing on the petition, because the rule in Copeland did not apply to the inmate on his collateral appeal. The court held that the inmate's counsel was not ineffective for failing to use photographs of the inmate's apartment during the trial because the apartment was under construction when she was appointed to represent him and she was unable to accurately recreate the inside of the apartment for a photograph. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to impeach one victim's testimony with her grand jury testimony because counsel testified that the State told her no grand jury transcript was available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to properly prepare mitigation evidence for sentencing, including witnesses' testimony that the inmate was a good, nice, and caring person, that his neighborhood was crime-ridden, and that he was placed in special education classes, because he failed to show that had the mitigating evidence been presented at trial, it was reasonably probable that the outcome of his sentencing would have been different. The witnesses were the inmate's family, friends, teachers, and coworkers and the mitigating evidence was subjected to substantial impeachment and potentially devastating rebuttal. Even if the inmate had a significant psychological disorder, the jury may have concluded that the mitigation evidence was insufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty when weighed against the aggravating evidence. The inmate's claim that counsel failed to develop a comprehensive theory of defense was rejected because counsel testified that the theory was that the inmate was unable to form the intent to justify a first-degree murder charge based on his assertion that, due to his use of cocaine, he could not remember what had happened.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that his conviction was void because the trial court never conducted a hearing on his motion for new trial and the issue was not previously litigated. The appellate court ruled that while it agreed that the specific issue of whether the trial court's failure to perform its duty as a thirteenth juror entitled the inmate to habeas corpus relief was not previously litigated, any failure by the trial court in this regard did not afford him the relief he sought. Failure of the trial court to exercise its role as thirteenth juror would make the conviction voidable. Also, the inmate argued that the trial court lacked the statutory authority to enter the judgments against him. The appellate court ruled that the inmate's judgment was not void on its face and he was not entitled to habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

The basic problem with the inmate's claims was that, even though it was his burden to do so under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-110(f) (2006), he presented virtually no relevant proof at the evidentiary hearing. Rather, he relied on detailed and lengthy prehearing pleadings and appellate briefs, which could not substitute for proof. Further, he failed to show that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. Amend. VI; Tenn. Const. Art. I, &sect; 9. Although the inmate elicited testimony from the victim's widow and daughter that trial counsel did not contact them, the inmate did not show that either witness would have provided information helpful or even material to his defense. In fact, the victim's widow testified that she was unsure whether she would have spoken to trial counsel, and the victim's daughter unequivocally stated that she would not have done so.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant to a pat-down search by police during a traffic stop. A handgun was found. On appeal, defendant presented the following issues for review: (1) whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7; and (2), whether the trial court erred in failing to find any mitigating factors when imposing the sentence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to suppress because defendant consented to the search. Moreover, the officer conducting the search at the time of the traffic stop had reason to believe defendant might have been armed or dangerous. The officer was justified in conducting a limited pat-down search. As to the sentence, defendant was subjected to range of 15 to 25 years, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-112(a)(1). When sentencing defendant to 25 years, the trial court properly applied enhancement factors. The trial court also considered, before rejecting, two mitigating factors pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. 40-35-113(6), (12).</SPAN></P>

A rational jury could have concluded from the evidence that petitioner was guilty of facilitation of felony murder. Petitioner and another person spotted the victim at an apartment complex, and the other person asked him to enter their car. As petitioner drove, the other person turned a gun on the victim and questioned him about the burglary. Petitioner stopped the vehicle and exited along with the other person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the Circuit Court for Hickman County (Tennessee), defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of rape of a child, leaving the sentence to be determined by the trial court. The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive eighteen-year sentences. Defendant appealed the judgments, claiming the trial court's decision to order consecutive sentences violated established Sixth Amendment precedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the trial court's decision to order consecutive sentences pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b)(5) as violating his Sixth Amendment rights to trial by jury. Defendant argued that the Blakely rule, under which fact-finding by a judge violated a defendant's right to a jury trial if the fact-finding subjected the defendant to increased punishment that would not have been allowed but for the fact-finding, should apply not only to sentencing enhancement factors, but also to the determination of whether multiple sentences should be served concurrently or consecutively. However, the appellate court noted that Tennessee courts had consistently held that the consecutive sentencing scheme did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Having reviewed the record, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in ordering defendant's sentences to be served consecutively, and that for purposes of T.C.A. &sect;40-35-102(1), the length of defendant's sentences were justly deserved in relation to the seriousness of the offenses and were no greater than that deserved for the offenses committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant entered a plea of guilty to one count of driving under the influence (DUI), first offense, the Criminal Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, sentenced him to 11 months, 29 days, to be suspended after serving 48 hours in confinement. As a condition of his guilty plea, defendant properly reserved a certified question of law as to whether he was subjected to an unconstitutional traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended his motion to suppress should have been granted because the officer did not have specific and articulable facts to believe that an offense had been committed. Specifically, defendant argued that the officer did not ascertain that the substance which defendant threw out of his car was in fact a cigarette package until after the traffic stop was initiated when defendant confirmed that he had thrown a cigarette package onto the surface of the parking lot. The appellate court disagreed, finding that whether the item was a cigarette package, a piece of paper, or some other type of garbage or other waste material, the officer's observations provided reasonable suspicion that defendant had violated the littering statute. As such, the officer had reasonable suspicion supported by specific and articulable facts to conduct an investigatory stop, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of attempted first degree premeditated murder, a Class A felony, and aggravated assault, a Class C felony. The Criminal Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee, merged the offenses and sentenced defendant to life without the possibility of parole as a repeat violent offender. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stabbed his father's girlfriend. The victim was unarmed. Defendant walked into the kitchen to obtain a knife, held the knife behind him while he approached the unaware victim, and told her &quot;I'll teach you&quot; just before stabbing her. Although there was evidence that defendant may have been arguing with his father before he stabbed the victim, she testified that she and defendant were getting along well that day. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that defendant formed the intent to kill the victim prior to his stabbing her and that he committed the act with premeditation. The trial court's decision to sentence defendant under the repeat violent offenders statute did not violate his rights to due process and equal protection of the law. The legislature's decision to impose the very severe sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole upon those criminals who repeatedly commit violent offenses was rationally related to its desire to protect the public and deter crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective for failing to test bloody shorts worn by a witness.

Counsel's explanation of why he chose not to request the shorts be tested left something to be desired, especially considering that counsel would not have necessarily been required to reveal whose blood was on the shorts. Petitioner was required, however, to show that he was prejudiced by failure of counsel to have the shorts tested. As it was not known whose blood was on the shorts, it was unknown as to what effect at trial the bloody shorts evidence might have had. Although petitioner was not given funds to test the shorts at the post-conviction stage, he could have questioned the witness at the post-conviction hearing as to whose blood was on the shorts. Petitioner had not proven that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred when it allowed defendant to waive his right to counsel because the colloquy between the trial court and defendant was insufficient to meet constitutional requirements. The court of appeals agreed. Specifically, defendant claimed that, although the trial court asked the routine questions required, his responses should have prompted further examination by the trial court, which was not done. The trial court allowed defendant to refuse to answer questions from his own counsel who was attempting to present an argument for defendant. Notably, defense counsel had not yet been discharged when the trial court refused to allow counsel to question defendant. Because defendant was still represented by counsel, counsel had a duty to zealously represent defendant. In the view of counsel, defendant would be better served if he were not allowed to represent himself. Counsel was not permitted to call witnesses or present evidence on behalf of defendant. The responses to counsel's questions were part of the inquiry that the situation demanded and the trial court did not &quot;investigate as long and as thoroughly as the circumstances demanded.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Williamson County (Tennessee) of criminal simulation with a value of less than $ 1,000, theft of property greater than $ 1,000 but less than $ 10,000, tampering with the evidence, and forgery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by not suppressing her statements to authorities because she was in custody at the time she made those statements and had not been given Miranda warnings. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that defendant was not in custody at the time she made statements to police officers. Detectives went to defendant's home, knocked, identified themselves and asked to speak with defendant. She was not arrested. Defendant invited the detectives into her home to speak with them. After asking a few questions, defendant indicated her intent to make things &quot;as difficult as possible,&quot; and refused consent for a search of her computer. However, defendant was free to come and go as she pleased. At one point defendant left and went and picked her daughter up at school. There was no indication that the questioning of defendant took place in a context where her freedom to depart was restricted in any way. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to relief on that issue.</SPAN></P>

He received an effective sentence of 145 years. In a habeas proceeding, petitioner argued that the trial court erred in failing to properly determine his indigency. The record on appeal did not include the activity in his inmate trust fund account, his motion to proceed in forma pauperis, or the pauper's oath and affirmation. Therefore, the appellate court could not review the matter. Summary dismissal of the habeas petition was proper because it did not state a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. Petitioner's claim that his indictments and his two convictions for aggravated assault were multiplicitous with two of his aggravated kidnapping convictions required the court to look beyond the face of the judgments; therefore, it was not a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. Petitioner's Blakely claim regarding his sentence would render the conviction voidable and not void; thus it was non-cognizable in habeas corpus review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Criminal Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of contempt. The trial court dismissed the two charges of impersonation of a licensed professional on double jeopardy grounds but refused to dismiss the two theft charges. The State and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the theft charges. The appellate court concluded that the elements of contempt were wholly different from the elements of both theft and impersonation of a licensed professional. The underlying facts supported all the charges. The evidence used to prove the charges against two individuals would be a part of but would not make up the entirety of the evidence used to prosecute the contempt charges. The contempt proceedings were not only based on defendant's pretending to be an attorney against the two individuals, but they were also based on similar acts against two others. The charges were not based on totally discrete acts, but partially discrete acts. The fact that the offenses addressed partially discrete acts and different victims suggested that separate prosecutions would not violate double jeopardy principles under the Tennessee Constitution. Three of the four factors supported allowing separate prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed denying dismissal of the theft charges; the judgment was reversed dismissing the charges of impersonation of a licensed professional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied, defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Lawrence County (Tennessee) to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the search of his person pursuant to the vehicle exception was improper. The court of appeals agreed. The detention during the process of issuing the citations was not unduly protracted to accommodate the dog's sweep. Thus, the officer's actions were within constitutional bounds when he discovered information via the trained dog's reaction that the vehicle contained narcotics. However, when the dog reacted to the passenger side door and the officer asked defendant, the driver, why the dog would have reacted, defendant denied knowledge of contraband. The officer then conducted a &quot;more thorough&quot; pat-down of defendant. An extension of the vehicle search exception was inapt for two reasons. First, defendant left the vehicle before the police acquired any indication that the vehicle contained material that they would be entitled to seize; the dog apparently did not react to any substances secluded on defendant's person. Second, a passenger in the vehicle occupied the seat near the door where the dog reacted. Therefore, the officer's ultimate, warrantless search of defendant was not justified by constitutional principles governing vehicle searches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by admitting a tape recording of the drug transaction into evidence and permitting it to be played for the jury because it was not properly authenticated and because it contained inadmissible hearsay. The court of appeals agreed, but found that any error was harmless. Although the informant identified defendant as the person that sold him the cocaine, he did not actually identify defendant's voice on the tape recording of the transaction. In consequence, the State failed to &quot;tie together&quot; the evidence as promised. Accordingly, the evidence should not have been admitted. Although the tape recording should not have been admitted into evidence absent an identification of defendant's voice, reversal was not required. The informant did not identify defendant's voice on the tape, but he did identify defendant as the person that sold him.9 grams of crack cocaine. In addition, the $ 200 in marked currency that had been provided to the informant to purchase the cocaine was found only hours later in defendant's front pocket. Under those circumstances, the erroneous admission of the tape recording was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the sufficiency of the convicting evidence was not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding. Thus, his assignment of error was without merit. His counsel was not ineffective under U.S. Const. amend. VI or Tenn. Const, art. I, &sect; 9 for not challenging the as-applied constitutionality of Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-17-1005. The statute's primary purpose was the protection of children and the inmate placed great reliance on the fact that the photographs at issue were never found and never seen by the jury. But, what the statute prohibited was not only the production of material involving lascivious exhibition, but the performance, which included a minor engaging in lascivious activities. The record also supported the determination that the inmate knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to testify under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Tenn. Const, art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) of two counts of first degree felony murder, one count of second degree murder, and two counts of aggravated child abuse. The trial court dismissed the second degree murder charge, merged the two felony murder convictions, and sentenced defendant to life in prison plus twenty-five years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The court of appeals disagreed. While neither of the medical professionals could testify as to who inflicted the injuries, defendant's wife testified that defendant was the child's primary caregiver, taking care of the child approximately eighty-five percent of the time. She testified to numerous questionable parenting practices on defendant's part. Both the wife and investigating police officers testified that the night the victim died, the victim's mother was frantic about the baby's well-being, while defendant appeared aloof and unconcerned. That evidence, though largely circumstantial, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant abused and neglected the victim in such a manner that led to serious bodily injury and ultimately death. The testimony that defendant was the primary caretaker and the medical examiner's testimony that the injuries could not have been accidentally inflicted were particularly significant and could have led the jury to reasonably conclude that the evidence excluded all reasonable hypotheses except for the guilt of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded to the trial court for merger of defendant's two aggravated child abuse convictions and a determination of whether consecutive sentences were appropriate.

Petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the sentences imposed by the trial court were unconstitutional because they were not set by a jury and were rendered void pursuant to the rule of law announced in Blakely. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss the petition. On appeal, the court found that petitioner's claim failed because even if a Blakely violation occurred, the violation would render the judgment voidable, not void. Petitioner's sentences were within the applicable range of punishment under the 1982 Sentencing Reform Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-603, -606, -3-401 (1982). Petitioner's judgments of conviction were not void. The sentence of confinement had not expired. Accordingly, petitioner was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate pled guilty to violating the Tennessee Habitual Motor Vehicle Offender Act. The Circuit Court for Marshall County (Tennessee) sentenced him to three years in confinement. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which the post-conviction court denied. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court did not see how the inmate was prejudiced by his attorneys' failure to call certain witnesses on his behalf. The inmate did not prove that the testimony addressing his sobriety and ability to work outweighed his more than 20 prior convictions. Additionally, the inmate's attorneys were not ineffective for not presenting witnesses because the inmate did not provide witness information to his attorneys. Furthermore, the appellate court concluded that the inmate voluntarily and intelligently pled guilty because, after being questioned by the post-conviction court at length pursuant to Tennessee Criminal Procedure Rule 11, the inmate stated that he understood that he was waiving his right to a jury trial and the right to appeal. Finally, although the post-conviction court erred by stating or believing that a habitual vehicle offender could not receive an alternative sentence, the error was harmless given the inmate's lengthy criminal record, which was an enhancement factor. Thus, under Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 9, of the Tennessee Constitution, the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed.</SPAN></P>

The court of criminal appeals disagreed. Counsel filed numerous pretrial motions on petitioner's behalf, including motions for discovery, for a mental examination, to exclude evidence, for impeachment evidence, and for a notice of an alibi defense. Counsel estimated that he met with petitioner at least a dozen times during the six months of his representation and confirmed that his billing records reflected he had spent approximately 60.15 hours on the case. Petitioner's compelled self-representation resulted from his own misbehavior and nothing else. All of the counsel appointed to represent petitioner were competent and experienced trial attorneys who took the appropriate steps in their preparation of the case at the time they were relieved from representation. Moreover, petitioner did not produce any witnesses or evidence that pretrial counsel failed to investigate or uncover that would have altered the outcome of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions because the victim did not clearly establish through her testimony what defendant did in each specific location, nor whether the acts occurred in Shelby County, Tennessee or DeSoto County, Mississippi. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence adduced at trial showed that defendant attacked the victim with his fists and a flashlight at a park near Third Street in Memphis and raped her at a vacant lot on Holmes Road, also in Memphis. The evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find the elements of aggravated rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the trial court improperly applied the position of trust enhancement factor to defendant's sentence because the nature of the relationship between defendant and the victim was not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the error was harmless. The record was clear that defendant's previous history of criminal convictions supported the enhancement of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for first degree premeditated murder. The court of criminal appeals disagreed. The proof at trial showed that defendant took his high-powered assault rifle with him to his friend's house. After his friend went to bed, defendant drove the friend's maroon pickup to a fruit stand. There, he tried to set the stand on fire. When the victim, a police officer, arrived in the parking lot, defendant hid behind the pickup and shot the victim as the victim approached. The evidence established that defendant shot the victim multiple times. Ballistics testing showed that the bullets recovered from the victim's body were fired from defendant's rifle. Defendant removed the victim's revolver and part of his bulletproof vest and returned to the friend's house, where he displayed the items and described the killing to his friend. Defendant had told witnesses of his animosity toward the police, demonstrating that he had a motive to kill the victim. Based on that evidence, the jury could reasonably and legitimately have concluded that defendant committed first degree premeditated murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant was convicted of first degree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder and attempted robbery.  The murder convictions merged into one conviction for first degree murder. The applicant alleged that the prosecutor's closing argument illegally amended the indictment, that count three of the indictment was constructively amended because the jury was allowed to convict him on a factual basis that effectively modified an element of the charged offense, and that the indictment for robbery did not cite a statute. The appellate court ruled that the trial court was correct in dismissing the petition for habeas corpus relief without a hearing and without appointment of counsel. The judgments attached to the petition for habeas corpus relief were facially valid. Also, even if the closing argument somehow resulted in an impermissible amendment of the indictment, the result would have made the applicant's judgment voidable rather than void. Furthermore, the indictment was sufficient to place the applicant on notice of the nature of the charge, confer jurisdiction upon the trial court, and protect against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate sought a writ of habeas corpus, attacking his convictions for aggravate kidnapping, especially aggravated robbery, especially aggravated burglary, and extortion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that his sentences had expired because he had served more time in custody that the jury verdicts alone would have allowed. The inmate's sentences for aggravated kidnapping and extortion did not violate the Sixth Amendment because those sentences were the presumptive minimum sentences. The claim that the sentences imposed on the aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary convictions violated the Apprendi rule failed as that case law was not given retroactive application in cases such as the inmate's, which were collateral attacks upon final judgments of conviction. Moreover, the Apprendi rule and its progeny did not affect the trial court's ability to find facts essential to justify consecutive sentencing. Finally, nothing in federal case law expanded the inmate's right's under Tennessee's habeas corpus procedure to attack a judgment that was merely voidable on its face. Thus, the inmate's claims were not cognizable in a state habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for sexually assaulting the victim, his 14-year-old daughter. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions because the jury accredited the victim's testimony, which included her descriptions of defendant's physical assaults, as well as her identification of herself and defendant in a photograph depicting intercourse. The jury also accredited the medical proof that negative physical findings were not inconsistent with sexual abuse having occurred. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from his home because defendant's mother-in-law, who identified herself as babysitting for defendant and his wife, invited the lieutenant to come inside. The officers were justified in securing the home for nearly five hours until a search warrant was obtained because they had good reason to believe that defendant would destroy evidence in his home, based on information the victim provided and the fact that both defendant and wife had been alerted to the officers' presence and were on their way home. The case was remanded for resentencing because of irregularities in the process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Tennessee criminal court found petitioner guilty of attempt to commit first degree murder and attempt to commit second degree murder, and his convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought habeas corpus relief under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 by alleging that his sentences were unconstitutional because they were not imposed by a jury and were thus rendered illegal pursuant to a new rule of law announced in the United States Supreme Court decision of Blakely v. Washington. However, the appellate court concluded that petitioner's Blakely claim failed because: (1) habeas corpus relief could be granted only if the petition established that the challenged judgment was void; and (2) even if a Blakely violation had occurred, the violation would have rendered petitioner's judgment merely voidable, not void. Thus, petitioner was not entitled to habeas corpus relief because he had established neither that his effective sentence had expired nor that the sentencing court was without jurisdiction or authority to enter the sentences imposed. Also, the appellate court held that Blakely v. Washington failed to afford petitioner a ground for postconviction relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-103 because the Blakely decision was not to be given retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1973 and 1974, the inmate was sentenced to prison for various crimes, including three determinate life sentences for one count of armed robbery with a deadly weapon and two counts of murder during the perpetration of a robbery. The inmate's second petition for habeas corpus was dismissed, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that the inmate's sentences in this case were not void merely because the sentencing scheme under 1919 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 5, &sect;&nbsp;1 had been declared unconstitutional. The jury-imposed sentences were lawful when they were received. Post-conviction relief would have been untimely in this case because all similarly situated persons had until July 1, 1989, to file such a claim for relief. The inmate's claim that his Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated was meritless because he was not sentenced under the 1974 sentencing statutes. Next, the fact that some of the inmate's claims were unintelligible was not a sufficient reason to appoint counsel. Finally, an argument regarding the integrity of the indictments was waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions and the trial court erred in imposing ten-year sentences.

Defendants admitted that they robbed the victim and took money and pizzas from him. Tenn.

Factor (14) applied in one defendant's case as the offense was committed while on a form of release for a felony conviction. The enhancement factors warranted increasing defendants' sentences to ten years. Defendants' fines were reduced to $50. The trial court erred in concluding under Tenn. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of one count of reckless homicide, a Class D felony, and received a four-year sentence to be served on probation. Defendant was the general manager of an amusement park and the State attempted to prove that defendant attached a jumper wire to the electrical panel of a ride in order to bypass its safety restrictions. A passenger fell to her death on that ride after her harness opened. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, stating that the evidence was sufficient. If the jury accredited the testimony of various witnesses, including amusement park employees, it could have rejected defendant's theory that the jumper wires were on the ride before it arrived at the amusement park, and accepted the State's theory that defendant had placed the wires on the ride. Additionally, the presence of the jumper wire on the ride created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of injury or death to those who rode it. Judicial diversion was not appropriate because defendant's exemplary lifestyle did not outweigh the circumstances of the offense, the need for deterrence, and the interests of the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective for failing to offer proof through another expert after the defense was unexpectedly confronted with the testimony of a rebuttal expert near the end of petitioner's proof. The court of appeals disagreed. Counsel testified that during a break, they discussed this development but decided not to move for a continuance. Counsel said that the issue of the victim's time of death was &quot;hotly contested&quot; and that the defense had already put on their expert proof through the testimony of their expert, which they considered damaging to the State's case. Counsel said that the defense had conferred with a forensic pathologist, but determined not to call him on petitioner's behalf because his opinions did not support their defense. Petitioner failed to demonstrate that counsel provided ineffective assistance. Counsel said that after being presented with the testimony, they conferred and decided not to seek a continuance. The decision was partly the result of lack of awareness of any measures the defense could have taken to counter the testimony. Under the facts presented, the decision not to challenge the testimony was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The entire attack lasted only &quot;ten to twenty-five&quot; seconds and consisted of only a brief struggle between the victim and defendant. While upon first consideration it might have appeared that defendant had a sexual purpose based upon the fact that he attacked the victim in the nude and in a state of &quot;semi-arousal,&quot; the victim's testimony focused on being pulled and pushed &quot;constantly&quot; toward the foliage around the trail. Because the victim fought off defendant, he was scarcely able to remove the victim from the path and was able to restrain her for only thirty seconds or less. Even though defendant might have ultimately acted in a manner that evidenced an intent to commit a rape and a distinct kidnapping, it could not be concluded from the facts that he did more than that which was necessary to attempt to subdue the victim in order to commit rape. Defendant did not clearly evidence a separate purpose and intent to kidnap the victim. Therefore, the struggle and resulting detention was &quot;essentially incidental&quot; to the attempt to rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because the officer had already issued the citations to defendant and the time frame for &quot;running the dog around&quot; the vehicle without any suspicion or cause had expired. The court of appeals agreed. The dog was trained to detect the presence of drugs, not items such as bolt-cutters or stolen lawn mowers. Moreover, the officer's initial concerns about defendant's being intoxicated were quickly dispelled following the officer's face-to-face encounter with defendant. No facts developed after the officer's approach of defendant's vehicle that independently supported conducting a canine sweep of the vehicle. The officer testified that defendant became &quot;nervous&quot; when the officer asked him for consent to search the vehicle; however, the court of appeals rejected that observation as a sole, independent basis for conducting the dog's sweep. There was no justification for delaying the detention for the purposes of using the drug dog, even if it was done &quot;real quickly.&quot; When the officer gave defendant the citations, the legitimacy of the detention ended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Lake County (Tennessee), which granted a petition for habeas corpus relief filed by petitioner inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was released to his mother after he was charged with theft of a vehicle. Shortly thereafter, he committed several other felonies. Defendant later entered a global plea agreement to many charges. The inmate then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief, which alleged that the sentences were illegal because they should have been consecutive. The trial court granted relief, and this appeal followed by the State. In affirming, the appellate court determined that it was not bound by the State's stipulation that the inmate was out on bail when the second crimes were committed because this involved a legal interpretation of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3). Next, the appellate court rejected the State's argument that the inmate's claim was not yet ripe because the inmate was alleging that all of the sentences were illegal. Finally, the appellate court held that the inmate was out on bail within the meaning of Rule 32(c)(3) when the second crimes were committed. A recognizance bond was a bail security. There was no difference between those released on a promise or a money bond. Because the law required consecutive sentences in this case, the concurrent sentences imposed were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision was affirmed. The case was remanded to a criminal court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant threatened to shoot at the victim's residence and warned her not to be there when he came back. One witness said that he was standing outside the victim's apartment and could see the victim standing in front of the living room window. The witnesses both observed defendant return to the apartment a few minutes after the confrontation on the sidewalk. Defendant pulled out a gun and shot into the open living room window, then sprayed the front of the apartment with bullets from right to left. After the shooting, defendant left the crime scene and drove off in his car. All of the shell casings in front of the apartment were fired from the same gun. There was no evidence that anyone inside the apartment was armed at the time of the shooting. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his first degree premeditated murder conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. There were numerous circumstances from which the jury could have concluded that the murder was premeditated. For example: (1) the victim was unarmed; (2) the particular cruelty of the killing, as evidenced by defendant ordering the victim to lie face down and, in execution style, shooting the helpless victim in the head; (3) defendant securing a weapon prior to the murder; and (4) calmness immediately after the killing as shown by defendant leaving the crime scene and proceeding to go on a shopping spree. Defendant's argument that he lacked the requisite mental state for premeditated murder was not persuasive. Defendant's own statement confirmed that the execution-style murder of the victim was committed without passion and was completed after defendant had removed valuables from the home. A jury could have found the essential elements of premeditation and intent beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, defendant did not meet his burden of proving that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for premeditated murder.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defendant waived the issue under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-106(g). Given the appellate court's previous determination of the issue, defendant failed to show that his constitutional right to a fair trial was violated. The appellate court had already decided the issue of sentencing. Defendant's claim that counsel failed to utilize a witness to attack the photographic lineup at the suppression hearing failed as it had been determined on direct appeal and counsel was not appointed until after the lineup suppression hearing. The witness would not have aided the defense with any significant testimony. Counsel had interviewed defendant's former employer prior to trial. Counsel sought to employ defendant's alibi defense at trial but made a strategic decision to abandon it after the trial judge ruled against the defense in a Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b) evidentiary hearing. The child victim was competent to testify accurately and honestly. Defendant's other issues were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that the affidavit in support of the arrest warrant was insufficient. The appellate court found that this argument was without warrant as all questions as to the sufficiency of a warrant were foreclosed by the finding of an indictment. The indictment referenced the statute defining the offense; as such, the indictments against the inmate were valid. The victim, by accepting partial payment, did not make an election of remedies pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-29-101 as there was no notice to the victim that the accounts were closed at the time either check was passed by the inmate to the victim. A determination of whether the inmate was entitled to relief based on an alleged violation of Brady would require an evidentiary hearing, and this was precisely why habeas corpus relief was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) of two counts of first degree murder, especially aggravated robbery, and setting fire to personal property. The trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive life sentences plus twenty-two years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for first-degree murder. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant called one victim to set up a meeting because defendant owed the victim money for crack cocaine. Defendant took his gun with him, got into the car with the two victims, and shot them both. Defendant pushed the driver out of the car and drove off with one of the victims still in the passenger seat. There was testimony that defendant appeared to be changing the music as he drove away from the crime scene, and he nodded to a witness as he drove by. Defendant pushed or dragged one victim down a hill behind a church in an attempt to hide his body. Defendant had his stepmother check into a motel where he disposed of money and drugs, and smoked a marijuana cigarette. When defendant attempted to leave the motel room, he was arrested. Additionally, there was testimony that defendant acted as if nothing was wrong in phone conversations shortly after the killings. All of that evidence fell under the factors that a rational jury could have used to infer premeditation on the part of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentences for his convictions for especially aggravated robbery and setting fire to personal property were modified from twenty to eighteen years and from two years to one year, respectively. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The proof showed only that the officer observed defendants' vehicle traveling within the bounds of the speed limit while other vehicles traveled 10 miles per hour in excess of the speed limit. There was no minimum speed limit posted on the road. The officer testified that traffic was able to pass defendants' vehicle in the right hand lane rather than being forced to stop by defendants' reduced speed, and therefore defendants were not violating Tenn.

The record reflected that defendant signed a waiver of rights form and that he initialed each of his rights. Defendant testified at the hearing that he understood his rights and gave a statement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Williamson County (Tennessee), which convicted her of nine counts of animal cruelty in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-202(a) (2003). She was sentenced to concurrent terms of 11 months, 29 days at 75 percent for each conviction, all suspended except for 10 days, with the remainder of time to be served on supervised probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of 11 counts of animal cruelty and the trial court merged the convictions involving the same animals, resulting in 9 convictions. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms, all suspended except for 10 days, with the remainder of the time to be served on supervised probation, followed by unsupervised probation. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but concluded that the trial court erred by ordering consecutive periods of probation in conjunction with concurrent sentences. Accordingly, the appellate court remanded for resentencing. Under the plain language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-202(a), a person committed &quot;an offense&quot; who tortured or maims &quot;an animal&quot; or failed unreasonably to provide necessary food, water, care, or shelter to &quot;an animal&quot; in his or her custody. The use of the plural in the separate penalty provision in &sect; 39-14-202(d) did not create any ambiguity in the definition of the offense in &sect; 39-14-202(a), which clearly provided that a single animal could form the basis for an offense. Additionally, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The inmate himself admitted that DNA analysis had previously been conducted on both himself and the victim in June 1990. However, he argued that he did not receive the results, which he claimed unequivocally excluded him as the perpetrator, prior to his guilty plea. The court of appeals, in affirming the dismissal of the inmate's prior petition for DNA analysis, found that not only were the results given to the inmate six months prior to entry of his pleas, they also were &quot;inconclusive.&quot; Thus, the inmate was not excluded as the perpetrator. Moreover, the inmate made no allegation that any new type of forensic analysis could resolve issues not resolved by the previous analysis. As noted by the State, the law of the case doctrine was applicable because a separate panel of the court of appeals had previously found that the inmate failed to meet the criteria in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-304 for DNA analysis, specifically &quot;that the evidence was never previously subjected to DNA analysis.&quot; Thus, review revealed that summary dismissal of the petition was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed the judgment of the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, denying his petition for habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted in 1997 of especially aggravated burglary, aggravated rape, robbery, aggravated burglary, and attempted rape. He was sentenced to serve his fifty-year sentence at one-hundred percent. In the habeas court, he alleged that his trial counsel rendered deficient performance, and that he suffered a procedural default which would entitle him to federal habeas corpus relief. He also alleged his sentence was in violation of Blakely. Because petitioner's Blakely claim would merely make his conviction voidable, not void, he was not entitled to relief. Blakely was not to be applied retroactively to cases. Further, petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not cognizable in a habeas proceeding in Tennessee, because it required the introduction of evidence from outside the record. Petitioner had already brought the claim in a post-conviction petition, and the cause and prejudice standard did not require the state habeas court to consider a procedurally defaulted claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for McMinn County (Tennessee), which had convicted him of first-degree murder in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a)(1) (1989) and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, stating that he failed to meet his burden of establishing that he was incompetent to stand trial either before or during his trial. Additionally, defendant did not successfully invoke his right to represent himself at trial. Thus, his right to self-representation was not denied. With the exception that defendant made no effort to conceal his crime, there was evidence of all of the indicators of a deliberate, premeditated killing. And, a reasonable-doubt instruction did not impermissibly raise the degree of doubt required for acquittal or correspondingly decrease the State's burden of proof in violation of defendant's due-process rights. Although it would have been more complete to advise the jury that premeditation required the exercise of reflection and judgment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-201(b)(2) (1989), the instruction, as given, did not incorrectly define premeditation or mislead the jury. Defendant's sentence was modified to a sentence of life imprisonment based on a balancing and proportionality review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree murder but modified his sentence of death to reflect a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's probation because it rightfully considered the drunk driving arrest in determining whether he had violated the terms of his probation.

Defendant was not entitled to relief on his claim that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-36-106(e)(3)(B) was unconstitutional as there was a distinction between community corrections and probation.</SPAN></P>

In the instant proceeding, the petitioner challenged the statutes under which he remained convicted. Specifically, he challenged the validity of the statutes, asserting that they failed to contain an enacting clause as required by the Tennessee Constitution. The trial court pointed out that the original Tennessee Public Acts enacting the laws under which defendant was convicted were all properly signed by the Speakers of the House and Senate of Tennessee, and signed by the governor of Tennessee. They were then within a year codified into the Tennessee Code with proper authentication. The trial court had proper jurisdiction over defendant's person, and the laws under which the defendant was prosecuted were validly enacted. The appellate court verified that the original legislation was properly enacted. Moreover, the matter satisfied the criteria of Tenn. R. Ct. Crim. App. 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant tried to sell the victim and his friends a pornographic DVD. The victim asked defendant if he was a child molester. Defendant got upset and shook a bat at the victim and his friends. They left. Two days later defendant saw the victim and hit him on the head with a baseball bat. The trial court asked the jury to continue deliberating, did not direct its comments to jurors in the minority, and did not urge jurors to acquiesce to the views of the majority. While the better practice would have been for the trial court not to make any comment regarding a possible retrial of the case, the trial court did not mention anything about the time, effort, or expense of a retrial. Thus, the trial court did not give the jury an improper instruction. In addition, despite the incorrect facts in the presentence report and the trial court's misstatement of the facts, the trial court properly sentenced defendant because (1) he had a prior conviction for second degree murder; (2) he had no hesitation about committing a crime when the risk to human life was high; and (3) the victim's statement to defendant two days before the assault did not justify his being hit on the head with a bat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals initially found that the trial court improperly classified and sentenced the defendant as a Range III, persistent offender. There was no means of determining if defendant's convictions under the Georgia statute were based on actions that would have resulted in convictions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-504. Defendant also argued that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court of appeals disagreed. Considering defendant's prior criminal convictions and his unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation, the sentence was not grossly disproportionate to his offense and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. It was clear from the transcript of the guilty plea hearing that defendant was aware of the sentencing range for bribery of a public servant, a Class C felony--three to fifteen years depending on his range classification. Moreover, the imposition of consecutive sentencing was authorized by Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32. Finally, any revocation of defendant's probation in Georgia resulting from the conduct giving rise to the present charges was simply a consequence of defendant's continued criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate, while a juvenile, was brought into juvenile court upon a petition alleging delinquency for theft of a vehicle. He was released to his mother after a detention hearing. Just a few months later, he was back in juvenile court on charges of especially aggravated robbery, second degree murder, and attempted second degree murder. Thereafter, a global plea agreement was entered. In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, the parties stipulated that the inmate was out on bail when he committed the second batch of crimes. The trial court found that the inmate's sentences were void because consecutive sentences were mandated under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3). The State's motion for reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the stipulation was impermissible under Tennessee law because it was interpreting the meaning of a court rule. Next, the claim was ripe because the legality of all the sentences was raised. Finally, the appellee court found that a juvenile could not have been released on bail since he could not have been arrested, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-11-105, 37-1-113.</SPAN></P>
